Freshman,5,"The Interactive Media program is great! As an avid gamer, I enjoy being a member of the esports club and have made a lot of friends with similar interests."
Freshman,5,In Harrisburg University you will find great professors dedicated for your success but also great faculty members and advisors willing to guide you and support your steps into the real world
Sophomore,5,"Harrisburg University prioritizes STEM learning. It is a quickly evolving university with a collaborative environment. There is an up-and-coming Esports team and a great on-campus community. Most professors are extremely knowledgeable in their field, and some go above and beyond to provide experiences for students. The area surrounding the school is relatively safe."
Freshman,5,I am transferring to Harrisburg university in the fall from hacc.  So far everyone has been really friendly and it is a nice campus!  I love that they have great scholarships for transfer students and that they guarantee a scholarship for everyone.
Freshman,5,"Harrisburg University is small in size, yet big in diversity, opportunity, and innovation.  If you want a state-of-the-art education, with real life preparation and experiences, HU is for you!"
Sophomore,5,I like that the teachers and staff want to help you do good in all your classes. The other students are friendly and easy to work with.
Freshman,5,What i like about Harrisburg university is that the professors know you because it is a small school. The professors can help you out and there are free help with your work  here also. I like the work here for my major because it is a new experience with interactive media. I like the new coding from fundamental of computing because it can be used at jobs. What i would like to see change is the outside of the community because it is a struggle out there and in the city of Harrisburg owes a lot of money. There are barely stores there to eat and all of the stores close very early. More paid jobs in Harrisburg.
Niche User,5,"i am currently a high school junior at Bowie high school and i got accepted into Harrisburg university. 
i have visited the school 4 times and i must say i loved everything about the school its my dream to attend and be part of the loving environment. i wish to use this scholarship money and use it for my books reasons being that i don't have enough scholarship money and my family isn't financially stable. 
i strongly recommend this school to any student who intends doing computer science and or science in the future. The school is well dedicated and willing to help all of their students study in any ways they can! my older cousin is recently a graduate from the school and she graduated two years back with good grades and good character behavior i intend to continue what she started  by Gods grace."
Freshman,5,"Harrisburg is full of diversity, this is an amazing school. Trying new things, joining clubs are all good. The school is in a good location which is in down town Harrisburg"
Sophomore,5,Provides excellent curriculum-based courses to fit the needs of today's unemployment issues. The professors at the university are there to help each student succeed. The class sizes are small to medium which gives a great student to professor ratio. It allows each student to get individual attention so he or she can succeed. I love this university because it is located in a quiet but excited area. It has the best of both worlds. The fast-paced but quiet life. I would recommend this university to anyone looking to advance in their career or earn a degree. Harrisburg University of Science and Technology is an excellent place to learn
Freshman,5,I love how they are set on making you the best person in the future  dorms are amazing it feels like home
Niche User,5,The campus is so unique and inviting. The classrooms overall were outstanding with the amount of technology they have for each major. I absolutely loved it.
Niche User,5,"My overall experience at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology was absolutely amazing. One of the student administrators took me on a tour and walked me around the beautiful campus. I explored the many different classrooms and dorms. One thing that I extremely enjoyed was the set up of the dorms and how spacious is was. After I explored everything I took my placement test. I was very nervous but after my nerves rubbed off, I believe that i did very well. The environment of the University and the diversity was just right for me. Everyone was nice and had a positive attitude.  I am extremely anxious to start my freshman year at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology  in the fall of 2017!"
College Senior,5,Popular course is MS ISEM
College Junior,5,Lots of options and the prices are very affordable for city housing.
College Junior,5,"A ton of options, the only issue is that some places close very early."
College Junior,5,"The financial aid is really good and the process is super easy. When I first applied, I was really worried about cost, but I am going on my fourth year here and I have never had a single problem."
College Freshman,5,"I love where my dorm is located. I have a nice view of another building and the best art is sunlight. Nature lighting is important to me. I use to live across from the current room I'll living in and that room was very dark. I don't like darkness, it makes me feel sad and dull, makes me feel very tired. So I decided to change my room across and I am loving it. It's too bad it cost so much, I really like the dorms but the cost of per month is really stressful."
College Freshman,5,Right next to the school. Very convenient and big varies
College Freshman,5,Teehee very cute and appropriate. No drinking. No drugs. Nothing to serious or scary to worry about especially with it being held within the dorm building and with high tech security.
College Freshman,5,"I've been told they're great if you have a high GPA. I, personally, haven't had one yet."
College Freshman,5,I've been told it's hard at first but the professors are kind enough to help.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very nice and outgoing. They are very open and love to break people out of their shell. Very welcoming as well and festive. They are creative with events and want everyone to feel comfortable and stress free. They are very willing to give any advice that may be needed. Also they're pretty funny!!
College Junior,5,"Everyone accepts each other for who they really are. We don't have a problem with racism or sexism at our school. We are very friendly and accepting of every gender, sexual orientation and that is definitely one thing I really love about HU. There is a place for everyone."
College Junior,5,"If I had the chance to go back and redo my school choice, I wouldn't change a thing. The faculty here treat me like an actual person; not like a child or a number. My first two years have been excellent and I plan to end well here too. In class, we learn, yet we laugh too and classes are enjoyable. I always have a story from class for my roommates. It is very easy to learn and enjoy what we are learning. I love that I can walk in the hall and stop to have a full fledged conversation with a faculty member and they ask how my mom is doing because they remember something I told them last month about my family."
College Junior,5,"I absolutely love how small my classes are. My forensics program is like a small family and that includes the professor. Dr. Robert Furey is an excellent teacher, always smiling and very professional. He has helped me greatly in the past year to get my projects done and ensure that I know which direction I am headed in toward the future."
College Junior,5,I feel very passionate about my program of study. I am a computer science major with a concentration of multimedia and video game development. I feel very comfortable about finding a job within my field when I graduate. There is always job openings for the technological field. I believe that once I obtain my degree that I will have all the credentials and background experience that would be needed to land a job within my field.
College Junior,5,"The off campus dining is very good around the city. There are a number of varieties to chose from. There are so many different cuisines that students can select Japanese, Indian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Mexican, american, Jamaican...etc. Students are always discussing the different varieties that they have to chose from. It makes it very interesting when going out  with a group of friends."
College Freshman,5,"In love with housing. The rooms are beyond spacious and the amenities are endless. We practically live in apartments and as far as roommates an socializing goes, if you find people that you can connect with, you will really enjoy it. "
College Freshman,5,"Because I knew what I wanted to do, getting involved in my major was very simple and my counselor is very helpful. "
College Freshman,5,"This school is only good on academics in my opinion. There is no social life, no night life, but the education is what is keeping me here. If your fully focused and you know what you want to do then this is the place for you."
College Junior,5,"The campus housing is very new and supports all students, since the university resides in the city ther housing is two separate building that are directly across from the school to ensure that students make it to class on time. The housing is very spacious and provides great accomodation for each student. The building are all brand new and have had the best renovations for each student. The housing is very affordable for students and the school will be opening a third housing building in the next year to accomodate more students who wish to live on campus instead of commuting."
College Junior,5,"The offcampus dining here for Harrisburg University of Science and Tachnology is excellent. There is a street that is called ""resturant row"" because of how many diverse and creative resturants that reside on the street. Students have amazing choices for their off-campus dining. There is even a local resturant that is ran by students from the surrounding area and the students cook the food also. Along with the dining there are events throughout the year that students can take part in and go from resturant to resturant sampling the different cuisine."
College Junior,5,"There is no drug scene at Harrisburg University at all, the school does a great job with making sure that all student are completly safe and have no interaction with drugs and or alcohol usage. They have multiple monitors for the dorms for the campus and they try their hardest to create activities and events that will keep students busy outside of classes."
College Sophomore,5,i love my program it is awesome the people are great and i love to learn science
College Sophomore,5,the most i use my computer skills is for essays nothing fancy
College Junior,5,"I am happy with being a Biology major but I really wanted my major to be Pre-Med. Unfortunately, my school doesn't have Pre-Med so I decided to take up Biology instead. The University does offer classes that will help me succeed in taking the MCAT so that I will be able to get into Medical School. I would do it all over again if I had to. I want to become a pediatrician and I have wanted to become one since I can remember. I don't have any concerns about finding a job I think that the world needs more doctors."
College Freshman,5,Harrisburg U – i feel very safe on campus there are places people can not enter without having a school ID. also there is a police station around the corner
College Sophomore,5,"Strawberry Square – - I love Strawberry Square b/c it has everything !
There are different types of food that you can choose
from and it also has ice cream. Plus, there are stores
within and a whole chocolate selection underneath the 
food court ."
College Sophomore,5,The campus dorms are all brand new and in great condition. They all com fully stocked with everything one would need for their first year of college.
Freshman,4,"Since we are online, professors are very understanding and give more leeway because anything can go wrong with technology."
Sophomore,4,"HU has a lot to offer for such a small school. You will probably end up receiving a lot of scholarships and financial aid, which is pretty good incentive imo. Most of the professors care about seeing their students succeed and the workload is only challenging if you aren't used to it. Tutoring is available if you're struggling. It will probably be difficult if you're trying to balance a job or extracurriculars. There are a ton of clubs that are continually growing and events on and off-campus. The campus itself is easy to navigate. You're close to the Susquehanna River, City Island, and the Capitol Building. Shops close pretty early, but CAT transit can take you wherever you need to go. I would recommend buying a bus pass to explore the city for the first month and then just pay with loose change thereafter. Dorms are decent, but pretty expensive. Most freshmen room in MVP. ROM is better. I will probably be at PA Place this semester which has better upkeep and amenities."
Niche User,4,For commuters it is very difficult to find parking in general. With it being surrounded by busy streets and state only parking garages.
Sophomore,4,"Harrisburg University is a great school with a great community. Everyone here seems genuinely kind and the activities available are great. The professors are great and because the school is relatively small they have more free time and are more willing to speak to the students on a regular bases. I have had very little problems with the school or its programs and since the school has been expanding more and more the last few years I would say i'm not the only one that is content with the state the school is in. I have been at the school for over a year living on campus and am currently in my second year, the housing is the best on-campus housing I have seen in any school and the city is full of kind people."
Sophomore,4,The staff is nice and does whatever they can to help you. They will go so far out of the way to make sure you succeed. Since they haven’t been around for too long the curriculum changes quite often. So it some years it’s way harder than others but trial and error is what it takes to succeed.
Junior,4,"Harrisburg University is a great school focused on academics. There isn’t a huge party scene and the campus is relatively small. Besides that, I’ve enjoyed the time I spent at the school so far & love the friends I have made here."
Niche User,4,I wish they would actually get dorms instead of just having a deal with the landlords across the street from the campus.
Junior,4,"This University is very hands on, and very personalized to the major you desire. It is for sure a science and technology school, and if looking into the business degree offered, I would suggest going elsewhere. There are many travel abroad opportunities for field studies as well."
Freshman,4,didn't start yet but i visited everything is high tech ....... its soo big .. the inside look so futuristic.. the dorm is right across the street
Sophomore,4,This is a very easy university to get into but a very hard one to stay in. Once your in you grade point average must be on point to stay with in the school
Junior,4,The school has great academics and the majors are really focused and straight forward. The classes are small so each student is able to have their question asked and answered. They provide a great tutoring program for those having trouble in sections. The only thing I would change is providing the school with a cafeteria. Because there is no cafeteria students are subjected to pay for their own food which could be difficult at times because we do not have jobs that we go to daily because of classes. 
College Junior,4,"So far at my current educational institution, I have had a great experience. The education is designed to assist me with achieving my goals within my desired career. My favorite experience is when I began my first class related to my major. This school really focuses on the different majors that they provide. if I was a high senior again I would reapply and attend here."
College Freshman,4,Main focus is on getting you into your desired career.
College Freshman,4,"I commute but am looking into living on campus, the rooms are basically mini apartments but are very costly."
College Freshman,4,It great loving it an my classes
College Freshman,4,"The school populace is very small and diverse. It's a fun and unique experience, being right downtown Harrisburg. There's plenty to do and the academics are great."
College Junior,4,"The housing is great and the rooms are very spacious. Although it is expensive, it is primarily due to it being University partnered housing, proximity to the school, and the fact that it is only one block from the capitol. The students in the dorm form a very family like environment and I honestly wouldn't want to live anywhere else. I just wish it was slightly cheaper."
College Freshman,4,My financial aid is all payed off but my housing. It's so stressful because I thought housing was with the tuition and they people who works for my school told me and family something way different from the housing leader told me.
College Freshman,4,The professors really care and take notice to you. They actually want you to succeed rather than just fail and take your money
College Freshman,4,I've seen a lot of diverse people around campus and everyone gets along just fine. Some are close friends.
College Freshman,4,You never once feel unsafe while on campus. Having visits isn't that bad unless your roommate has a issue with it and in terms of noise. It's for the greater good of those who are studying. They're very considerate of the students and want to students to be mindful of each other.
College Freshman,4,Everything is so close so I never have to go far. Especially the clothing and food stores. It makes things like carrying food home very convenient and helpful. Not to mention less stressful.
College Freshman,4,The professors are very understanding and caring of their students.
College Freshman,4,I had some troubles but the director was very kind and helped me through everything. I felt stress free and very calm after he explained everything too.:-) :-)
College Junior,4,"Getting into my program of Forensic Science was difficult at all. There were a few lengthy essays to write but they were well worth writing since it got me scholarships for my program. My admission counselor was very nice and always helpful and even two years after I got into my program, he still contacts me to make sure that I am okay."
College Junior,4,"That fact that it's so small makes the students feel important. Average class sizes are about 15-20 people so all the professors know you by name and are completely willing to stop what they're doing to help you out. More than half of the students at Harrisburg University receive financial aid of some sort and our school, being a private school, isn't as expensive as other private schools. The academic programs at our school each have professors who work in that field and the students get hands on experience in what they want to do in their careers."
College Junior,4,"It was very comfortable  living on campus. The school is very close to the residential buildings so things like the cold or rain didn't really prohibit us from getting from point A to point B. The dorm rooms are built like apartments, so I only have to share my bathroom and kitchen with two people which is very comfortable. Upperclassmen get first pick on which ""apartment"" they would like to have the following semester and who they want to live with as well. The cost is a bit pricey but all worth it in the end."
College Junior,4,"The guys and girls that attend Harrisburg University are for the most part pretty average. The interest, dress attire, social life...etc. There is nothing out of the ordinary in the campus life between the guys and girls. Its nothing more than any student could expect to experience when attending school. It pretty much depends on what the student make of their time attending the university."
College Junior,4,"The majors that are offered are very diverse and there are many different programs that a student can choose from when attending. The majority of student have technological degrees or obtaining one. There are many different career opportunities that each student can take a shot at. As far as internships, well it can be quite difficult for a student to decide or find anywhere that will offer what a student needs to fulfill the requirements of their internship."
College Junior,4,"You actually don't see or hear anything about drugs on the campus, sure you might overhear a few student talking about it but it's not a huge deal t student. The campus really prides itself on it's drug safety. The only thing that you really hear about is drinking between student and  that is normally around the end of mid-terms or finals and then of course around graduation but for the most part all students are very focused on their work and any other responsibilities they have."
College Junior,4,"The weather is great for the most part, we experience all forms of weather here around the campus but for the most part it is pretty mild, everyone goes out and about when it is nice. The temperatures stay pretty consistent even through the winter months at times."
College Junior,4,"The academics are great, provide many unique courses"
College Freshman,4,I received several awards here and didn't have to do too much to acquire them.
College Freshman,4,"We do not have computer labs because students are encouraged to have their own laptops. However, we have around the clock tech support as well as reliable internet access and printing availability. "
College Freshman,4,I am able to apply for the 5-year bachelors to masters program for my field of study and I love it. I have yet to get into my classes for the study but I am excited to do so.
College Freshman,4,"This school particularly caters to those in field of interest of science and technology and that is all. Once your done with your core classes (english, math, etc), the professors primarily focus on classes relevant to your choice of study, "
College Sophomore,4,Financial aid was great and they take care of any issues with ease. 
College Junior,4,"Housing for students is a great place to live.  Each dorm room has wifi, all the rooms are furnished and the all come with a very own kitchen the includes a dish washer.  Although it is a bit pricey, it is a great place to live."
College Junior,4,"The Majors that are offered, are very diverse and are well paying jobs as well."
College Junior,4,"Housing at Harrisburg University is very different.  The dorms are more like apartments, and they are very spacious."
Junior,2,"The college curriculum wise could use a lot of improvement as it is not as cohesive as it should be for all majors. There is a lack of flexibility and accommodation for those who are commuters, as the parking garage is not available for use in a reasonable manner. As most commuters like myself have to find outsourced parking opportunities which tend to be very expensive. On the point of expenses there is no campus food court or food plan, as the students are intended to use the mall food court and there are few efficient ways for students to obtain affordable groceries. The main redeeming factor is the scholarship and financial accommodations for this school, as it allows you to gain an education without the use of major loans. Along with a really pleasant and helpful faculty. It’s not a terrible college overall but there is room for major improvement, and a need to take feedback from students when developing improvements."
College Freshman,2,"We don't have any school athletics, but are starting to get more people involved in athletic related clubs."
College Junior,2,"We don't have actual sports teams that the school sponsors. We do have athletic clubs that raise their own money and clubs that meet at nearby fields to play random games. Many students do, however, try to get the school to get us a few things, like a football league or something."
College Freshman,2,"The school is fairly new, therefore we have minimal sports that few students participate in, but no varsity sports. "
College Freshman,2,Everything in Harrisburg closes very early and the costs are quite expensive for broke college students. 
College Freshman,2,"The school is expensive, and although I received a good amount of financial aid, I am still missing a lot of money and it is the struggle because the school can only offer but so much. "
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much campus strictness at all. 
College Sophomore,2,"The university doesn't help students find off campus housing. However, living off campus is very cheap. "
College Sophomore,2,"It's always windy and the city is dirty. The city is also unsafe as there are dangerous people lurking around at night. The city closes down at 8pm besides restaurants or bars, so you can always here drunk people getting into fights or making noise at night, any day of the week. "
College Sophomore,2,"The rooms are apartment style, however it doesn't promote a college atmosphere. Also, the rooms have full kitchens so many mice make their way in. There aren't any fun activities to do in housing, and the ""common rooms"" are almost nonexistent. "
College Senior,2,"The campus is very small and does not have food places of its own but it is very close, rather the building is attached to a shopping center that has a food court, bank and other professional services."
College Junior,2,"Internships, two projects, and having a small class size is one of the nice things.  Also, knowing that there is several companies surrounding the school, allows easy access for upcoming jobs."
College Junior,2,"Currently there are no Facilities at the University.  Since it is in the city, the only things that are available is the Strawberry Square, City Island and maybe some events."
College Freshman,2,I received some financial aid but mostly had to take out loans and now I still have to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket that I just do not have.
College Freshman,2,"I recieved next to no financial aid when I needed it most. On top of that, some papers were mixed up saying I owed more than I really did."
College Freshman,2,"Technology and Dorms – My school's technology is different from other colleges;they have some plat screen T.V.'s around some of the classrooms, they have electronic remotes that control the light and the prejector in the class. The school has a god science program as well. Their dorms are not regular dorms you see at another college, they are apartments which means you have to buy your own food and cleaning products."
College Senior,2,"Failing Students Pretty Much Get a Free Ride – If you are a student with zero motivation, you will pretty much get every institutional award available. In spite of never studying or being prepared for any of your courses, ever, the teachers will all let you slide with the necessary gpa to qualify. Students with poor performance and absolutely no reason to go to college will be treated very well at HU. If you are a highly motivated student, who legitimately maintains a strong gpa, and actually tries to learn your course material, do not go to HU. You will get screwed in scholarship aid."
Niche User,1,I don't trust this University and will not comment on the experience.  HU needs to team up with the right people to gain trust.
Graduate Student,1,"The University is awful. The tuition is expensive but the service offered is horrendous. They send you emails to pay school but they take forever to fulfill any type of request. Most if not all departments don't work appropriately, they don't know things they suppose to and it is frustrating. 
I will NEVER recommend this university to anyone and regret to be there."
Junior,1,"Harrisburg University is a trap. It does not give you a true college experience. They clearly dont care about the students needs, only what draws in the most attention or money. One of the only good things is the small class size so you can really get to know your professors. There is no real campus, the city area does not feel safe. Theres no atheletics, no campus food, not a typical college experience."
Graduate Student,1,"A loophole for non immigrant aliens with no H1B visa. A terrible waste of money and a degree from here has absolutely no merit. There are no standards or requirements for admission. The staff have real careers and choose to stop by HU once a month to supplement their household income. The tests don't change from year to year. Neither do the assignments. You can have all the material you need to pass a class, before you start the semester"
Niche User,1,"Terrible school! The academics were horrible and when I went to transfer. None of my classes transferred when I left the school. I changed my major and i went to my counselor to transfer, she told me the school had the program but when i went back to head of the department he said they didnt and told me to leave"
Sophomore,1,"Do not go here. The school is a scam. They make you take all these classes for freshman year that doesn't even transfer. Its not an ""actual"" school, its more of a business. I advise you to live off campus because the 2 dorm buildings are nasty. Nothing is ever fixed. It is also a boring school and a boring area even though it's downtown. Everything closes early. It is best to have a car. Overall the school is boring but the education is ok. The education is at a high school level."
College Freshman,1,no athletics at this school
College Freshman,1,Students feel ripped-off. The school has been scamming students for years.
College Freshman,1,"Do you want headaches and suffering for six months each year? Then, choose to live at HU. Worst experience of my life as a first time renter. I wish I had the knowledge I gained throughout this entire thing. The management is poor, the students are wild, drunk animals that destroy the building, and too expensive. PMI, the corporation that owns the building, NEVER fixed anything that was broken. Our toilet overflowed and broke the week of finals and my roommate and I had to WALK TO THE UNIVERSITY at 3 AM to use the bathroom for FIVE DAYS. I was so thankful to go back to New Jersey that weekend...

Want a beautiful, quiet place to live? Go to Pennsylvania Place or somewhere else nearby in Downtown Harrisburg. You'll definately save money and won't have to deal with crooked PMI and the school not ENFORCING rules! Don't do it!"
Recent Alumnus,1,No sports at this school :/ No track/gym etc
Recent Alumnus,1,Have fun living in the hood. Anything BUT HU's 1000$ per month single bedroom apts will be in the hood. oh and you have to stick two people into a one bedroom apartment that HU gets 1000$ per kid per month from. so 2000 for 800 square feet? You could afford a mortgage on a million dollar home with 6 bedrooms for 2k a month. Get your friends and do that instead.
College Junior,1,Not good at all. A bunch of people getting drunk on terrible alcohol standing around while worse music is played.
College Freshman,1,This school has potential for sports but no one has gotten the club or and sport up and running.
College Sophomore,1,The local atmosphere is downtown Harrisburg. Many homeless people and low-lifes always lurk around the area.
College Sophomore,1,"The professors work close to students because of the small class sizes. The workload is easy.The popular study areas is anything in a technology based major, which is where ALL of the opportunities are. "
College Sophomore,1,"There is no unique aspects of my major, Biology and Environmental Science. There are no activities and opportunities offered here, which makes people lose their inspiration within the major. "
College Sophomore,1,There are no facilities provided for students to hang out. This school things that using a couple chairs and tables is a student center/hub. They need to pay attention to creating activities for students so that people will stop transferring. 
College Sophomore,1,"It's all just fast food places around Harrisburg. When you go to a higher quality restaurant, or even a specialty diet one, it's extremely expensive. "
College Sophomore,1,"It's dangerous to go out at night, even with a group of people. The only activities at night are for people 21 and over. "
College Sophomore,1,"The only good thing about the school is the small class size and apartment-style dorm rooms. If you're a technology major, you'll have opportunity. If you're a life sciences major, forget it.
The university doesn't provide quality activities for students, and the Harrisburg location is dangerous and boring. There's literally nothing to do besides study and sleep.

If you don't have a car, and can't afford a 700$ per semester charge for the parking garage, then there's no way to purchase groceries or do activities. The school doesn't have a cafeteria because the students have a full kitchen, however mice have been constantly found within the buildings.

The school provides a few clubs, but they barely sponsor them and have good quality activities.I've lost my inspiration for my major at this university because of the lack of opportunity and a college life experience,. I can't wait to transfer this semester."

Niche User,5,I love the online course. It is made very easy to navigate and the staff is awesome in helping you. I called the advisor and was transferred and help with all the issues I had in one simple phone call. The instructors are great at the rate they response back to you in class.

Freshman,5,"Although I haven’t been here for long,  I’m still really enjoying my time in College Park. The professors I have are great, the campus is nice. The staff is doing an okay job at making sure students have things to do while covid-19 is present, although there could be some improvements."
Sophomore,5,This is a great diverse campus to live on and has great atmosphere. The faculty does a great job in delivering information and you meet a lot of new friends.
Junior,5,The diversity of the classes offered is amazing and really allows each student to complete their degree quickly.
Freshman,5,It was great and it really helped with my major of computer science. Living in maryland the in-state tuition was definitely an incentive and it paid off. I recommend the college to any high schools students who live in maryland.
Alum,5,"I  took a few classes online at the university. The classes online were a lot easier. During the COVID transfer, they struggled a little bit but the eventually found their holding. The professors were dependable and got as much information across."
Sophomore,5,I am so happy and blessed to be a student at such a prestigious school at the University of Maryland. It makes me proud to be at one of the most reknown universties studying a major I truly enjoy.
Sophomore,5,I am so happy to be a student at such a prestigious institution such as The University of Maryland. I am so glad with the majors offered and the amazing classes I have taken so far.
Freshman,5,I took a few online courses for Calculus 2 and Chemistry and the experience has been quite great towards myself and other students who attend this college.
Sophomore,5,There are many opportunities on campus and there will never be a dull moment. All my classes have been a lot of fun and I have loved all of my professors. Its been really easy to make friends and not a day goes by where I dont have a good laugh. I feel like I have learned so much in the past year Ive attended and I look forward to the next three.
Alum,5,"I did not take any online courses, so I am unable to provide a review. I am not aware if online courses are even offered."
Alum,5,I believe UMD is an excellent school. The professors were always willing to assist  their students and challenge them.
Senior,5,"I transferred to UMD in 2019 and I am now an uprising senior, but my time at UMD has been very memorable. The student body is more diverse than you'd think, and the resources provided are phenomenal."
Sophomore,5,I fell in love with the school the second I stepped on campus. It is so easy to become a part of the community and the basketball games are AMAZING!!
Sophomore,5,"The University of Maryland had been an excellent experience through my first year. I throughly enjoyed the school spirit that comes with being a terp and the many opportunities that the school has from an educational standpoint. There is a wide range of studies that they have to offer which is extremely helpful for someone who comes in not knowing exactly what they want to major in. There are plenty of clubs, athletics and study abroad programs to participate in. I would like to see the university give more attention to online classes as the world has been relying on them in order to progress during the global COVID-19 pandemic."
Graduate Student,5,I love campus. The vibe and faculty there help you in every way possible. There is plenty of clubs and things to do to be involved with outside of your major. There is so many opportunities to take.
Graduate Student,5,"Online learning is very easy to work with especially if you have great professors. It helps when your professors do help you when you have questions and they reply right away, quick responses."
Freshman,5,The place is great! The teachers are extremely supportive and caring. The food if also pretty amazing.
Freshman,5,The place is great! The teachers are extremely supportive and caring. The food if also pretty amazing.
Alum,5,"I transferred from a community college to UMD. I was awarded the Transfer Academic Excellence Award (TAES) scholarship by UMD. I loved my time there. I loved the campus, I enjoyed my professors,  I benefited from all the networking events and job fairs and enjoyed volunteering to help out community. UMD offers the whole package. I am proud to be a Terp."
Alum,5,"My online experience was effective. Professors teaching in a distance learning form were very attentive and supportive of students. Professors had great communication skill and were very responsive. Professors established a safe equal, and positive learning environment."
Alum,5,"I was a transfer student who complete my program curriculum within two years and graduated on time. Faculty were welcoming, helpful, and eager to prepare students for the real world. I was a commuter with a lot of opportunities to participate and be involved in extracurricular activities and school functions.  The University of Maryland - College Park is a great school to grow into a professional for local and out-of-state students of all ages."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Maryland has not only exceeded my expectations, but already helped prepare me for my future. Campus can be huge, but it really does not feel that way. Within the university is your college and within your college are most of your classes. My college is called the college of Behavioral and Social Sciences (BSOS). The BSOS department is always willing and ready to help in any way possible and give me the best advice to prepare me for the future. There are multiple career fairs for countless majors, giving both me and my brother job opportunities. Aside from academics, there are endless opportunities to create friends and join clubs. I have made some of my best friends and had some of my best experiences (simple things like hanging out on the mall playing frisbee and adventuring together). I could not ask for a better place to spend the rest of my college experience."
Sophomore,5,"Through the coronavirus, all of my classes transitioned to an online platform. My professors handled it amazingly well, especially considering the amount of stress in the world. They were more understanding, responded very quickly, and even diminshed unnecessary work. There would be PowerPoint slides, Panopoto recordings, and live Zoom meetings. They did not go easy on us, but did help us along the way. Additionally, I am taking a summer class and my professor has made the assignments more relevant to students today and how we connect best with the world, making work about quality and not quantity."
Senior,5,I have taken all classes online.  The 8 week condensed curriculum is stressful but achievable.  All of my professors have been easily accessible and caring. I have recommended UMGC and will continue to give the on-line classes high accolades.
Senior,5,"My overall learning experience at the University of Maryland Global Campus has been challenging, rewarding, enlightening, and stimulatung."
Sophomore,5,"The online was quite interesting, and new, but it was insightful, and a great learning experience. I was able to communicate to make professors in a fast manner. In addition, I was able to learn all the material from that class as if I was still learning face to face. I also, enjoyed the prerecorded lessons, because it allowed me to go back and review the information, and it allowed me to understand things more clearly."
Sophomore,5,"I liked the welcoming environment, as well as the campus and different activities offered at the school. I also, enjoy how friendly the professors are, and they are helpful, and clear, in delivering the material."
Junior,5,"Obviously it differs in difficulty depending on the major, but for mine it was relatively enjoyable and easy to learn online. In fact, I found that professors were more lenient on attendance and individual studying time compared to having to stick to the required time slots per class. This made time management super easy for me to practice and follow."
Sophomore,5,UMD is perfect way to experience all aspects of college and get involved in so many activities and groups.
Alum,5,"I went to UMCP as a transfer student. UMD did everything in its power to make sure that Transfer students felt welcome on campus and in classes. Transfer2Terp was a memorable experience, especially working with the professors!"
Alum,5,Excellent school! Great teachers and  great start to a fulfilling career. I learned so much at the university. My teachers were always available for tutoring and gave me knowledge I’m still using in my field.
Junior,5,I enjoyed how hard the teachers work to teach us military families overseas. They make sure they do everything they can to help you and make sure you understand all the content.
Junior,5,"I love it! UMD is my home away from home. I have incredible opportunities socially, academically, and professionally and I thank UMD for helping me succeed."
Alum,5,"I LOVED IT! I feel like there are endless opportunities at this school. I really enjoyed that they emphasized how there is a place for everyone here. I completely agree. The professors are great, and the support is endless. One thing for sure is that since it is a big school, sometimes you have to seek the opportunities out yourself, but trust me, they are there!"
Sophomore,5,Student life is amazing professors are helpful but understanding. Even though the school is on the liberal side we tend to be accepting of people who share different views than us
Niche User,5,I loved seeing all the recycling and composting stations and the fact that meals can be requested for the chef in the dining hall to make. It makes me feel as though the school cares about both the environment and its students minute needs.
Freshman,5,"Maryland is a highly rated public university located in College Park, Maryland in the Washington, D.C. Area. It is a large institution with an enrollment of 27,708 undergraduate students. Admissions are fairly competitive as the Maryland acceptance rate is 45%. Popular majors include Information Science, Economics, and Biology. Graduating 85% of students, Maryland alumni go on to earn a starting salary of $47,200."
Alum,5,"Amazing experience. I thought I wanted to go to a small school, but I realized I was an extrovert in college, and UMD was the perfect place. There's so much to do, the students are motivated and it's like an insulated theme park of student activities and clubs. It's a fantastic experience, and it's incredibly diverse. Great instate tuition too.

It must be said, though, that the administration leaves a lot to be desired, from the mold, adenovirus, the death of Jordan McNair and more. Wallace Loh is thankfully gone."
Freshman,5,"UMD is a prestigious school for Business and Stem students. It has a diverse school population. It has a wide variety of activities to do on or around campus. The school is just one metro ride away from the heart of D.C.. Lastly, it is very easy to obtain a job if you get a degree from the University of Maryland!"
Niche User,5,It is a very spacious and beautiful college to be at. College Park provides a multitude of programs and it allows you to be who you want to be and will definitely push you to do more.

Sophomore,5,I like the friendly environment and the genuine interest professors have with teaching. Totally different than my previous school
Senior,5,"I love UMD! I'm so glad that I transferred here. My biggest regret is that I didn't transfer sooner. There is pretty much always something to do on campus, whether you're hanging out with friends, going to a sporting event, going to a school sponsored event, you won't be bored. The level of difficulty is what you expected when it comes to college, yes you will have to study compared to high school and you will have to do the readings even if they're not mandatory. But I think it's worth it.

My only complaint is that UMD screws transfer students, you're chance at getting on-campus housing is 0%. You're treated like a second class student here. How are you supposed to make friends if you don't know anyone and don't live in the dorms? 

Sure it's not perfect but no college is, I think it should be you're number one choice to go to if you really want the college experience at an extremely affordable price  with a very reputable college name."
Senior,5,It was very good surrondings and everytime I comeback to see the place theres always cheerful and entertaining college tourists. The students there are just great.
Freshman,5,"My first semester at UMD was amazing, and I felt it had the best balance between school and social life for me. I was able to meet so many amazing people in my own dorm, as well as through the different activities I participated in. Even the orientation before school was awesome, and I met a few of my closest friends at school during that time. Academically, the school really challenges you if you seek a challenge, and the professors are more than willing to help you when you struggle. Food wise, man just about everything was good from the cafeterias, and off of South Campus there's plenty of chill, small places to stop by at night or on the weekend."
Sophomore,5,"The online classes are super easy, fun and very easy to navigate. The professors are quick to respond and make time to help you with questions you have."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about the University of Maryland is that it prioritizes academics and future success. The vast majority of the professors are good and the programs here have numerous connections to places where people can start their careers. In addition, the campus is beautiful and extremely safe, and the university has services that ensure the safety of its students. Furthermore, the numerous clubs that the University of Maryland have has made it easy to create friendships."
Junior,5,This is my first year at the University of Maryland and I love it! It's the best college in Maryland and I have family there that we are supportive of each other and to work hard to achieve goals. The professors are great along with the TAs that are helpful and can make assignments a little easier for anyone. Campus life is great and getting involved with on-campus activities makes it fun and enjoyable such as making new friends and having a new experience. I would recommend UMD as a great choice for anyone who wants to pursue their dreams and to have fun.
Sophomore,5,"I currently go to the University of Maryland where I am a biology major. There are many opportunities for clubs, many different activities and organizations."
Senior,5,"My experience with UMD has been amazing! There's so many opportunities for career and professional development in any major, along with countless extracurricular programs. I've truly been able to develop as a person thanks to the wonderful friends and mentors I've made at this school. Being close to DC is also a big plus. Fear the Turtle!"
Freshman,5,"I just finished my first semester at UMD and everything about it was just as I imagined it.  Such great classes, such a positive environment, and so much to do outside of just academics.  Full of opportunity!"
Freshman,5,"Without a doubt UMD College Park is an amazing school! The campus is the perfect size; it is certainly large but not at all too big. It can be a pain if you have a class on the complete opposite side of campus, but the walk will allow you to see different parts of campus and different people along the way. -When others ask me what college I attend and I respond University of Maryland College Park, people are impressed. I have met a significant number of people who attended UMD themselves and are very familiar with CP. The reputation that UMD has built truly carries a long way; I am confident that when I apply for a professional career later in life that the employer will have heard great things about UMD and be impressed. Even those who never attended UMD are familiar with the intense school spirit and many support the sports teams."
Niche User,5,"The Campus was huge!! It felt like its own city. Once I stepped on to the Campus, I was immediately treated with kindness and respect  from the staff there and loved all the buildings. I definitely want to apply there!"
Junior,5,I love UMD. The freshmen dorms need some updating and the Wifi is terrible. Its also note the safest area to be located but its proximity to DC is really convenient
Sophomore,5,The best thing I like about UMD is its sports and athletic culture. Whenever I go to a game its always fun and exciting to see UMD win especially men' soccer and basketball games- the energy of students is something different. One thing I don't like about college park is safety after dark as a lot of cases are reported recently which scares me go outside after 10pm.
Senior,5,"UMd is a rigorous experience, but offers a truly exceptional academic program elite teaching corps, great resources, a huge selection of extracurriculars, a very comfortable campus with a diverse student body, and a truly awesome social environment. It's amazing what value you get as a Maryland student. It also has great sports programs, Greek life, and clubs."
Niche User,5,university of maryland college park is an excellent campus and it would be an honor to be able to attend in the fall of 2020
Sophomore,5,"If I had to describe the University of Maryland in one word, it would be diversity. The sheer amount of students brings equal amount of cultural and intellectual differences. This is what makes the University of Maryland stand out and I believe is what will continue to bring growth to the university."
Sophomore,4,"Good school, but it is very liberal and regardless of your views - you’d want your education to be unbiased"
Sophomore,4,They’re trying incredibly hard to make this better for everyone even though it’s a hard situation for everyone
Freshman,4,"I am taking almost all of my classes online, but I’m still living on campus. The professors are mostly doing a good job with the transition and haven’t run into any significant problems."
Sophomore,4,"I live in the dorms which are pretty adequate. The education and classes are amazing. I love the culture at school, lots of school pride. The athletics team is amazing. Professors expect lots from students."
Sophomore,4,Very difficult to learn online. Tuition is still the same and mandatory fees. Classes are interesting online. Campus is still beautiful and lots of kids.
Freshman,4,I am currently taking classes online and while it is an adjustment for everyone (teachers included) I feel as if my professors are doing a really good job adjusting and even utilizing the online nature of classes in a way that is beneficial to students.
Freshman,4,"While I have only been taking online classes for a few weeks now I am having a very positive experience with the University of Maryland. My teachers and advisors are very responsive and I truly feel like I am learning a lot despite the circumstances. I am an English major in the Honors Humanities program, and while I was initially hesitant, worried that as an English major I would not get as much attention as a STEM major, the English program has been amazing. I am consistently contacted about opportunities for English majors and never feel lost or out of the loop."
Senior,4,"I did a semester of online, its the best it can be to be honest. They can't really do   anything because of the current situation. I wish they would lower tuition though."
Senior,4,I really like UMD. They have a lot of opportunities to get involved and the education is definitely really good. My 2 years at college park so far has been a blast. I got to meet some great people and learned a lot as well. They give you a lot of flexibility to choose your classes the way you see fit. You can mix and match and because it is such a big school you are guaranteed to fit in somewhere. Overall I would say its a good school.
Sophomore,4,"Learning online was an unprecedented experience. Initially it was a little confusing transitioning to a complete online setting but over time, the use of Zoom and GoogleMeets became more familiar!"
Freshman,4,"I didn't take any classes online personally, but I have heard they are very good. I prefer to work on classes in person and I learn better that way."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are very understanding when we switched to online and considerate of the student's location. For me, we had to switch to online learning mid semester, so the plans that professors have had plans had also gotten interfered with."
Sophomore,4,"What I like most about the University of Maryland is the campus and student communities. The diverse groups and clubs on campus guarantees that you will find one that you truly make you feel like you belong. I am also a commuter and the parking may have some rules that you have to be aware of, but at least I know I have a reliable place to park at."
Sophomore,4,"I really like UMD overall. The quality of education is excellent, most of the professors are awesome, and the atmosphere and students make me feel right at home. However, freshman dorms are pretty bad, and campus dining isn't great either. I also wish I knew how expensive off-campus housing is, at least if you want to be in a semi-nice building. The party scene is super fun, whether you're in greek life or just going to the bars, and there are always sober things to do whether you're in college park or venture into DC."
Senior,4,"I had a good online experience. It wasn't stressful or hard to manage, it was almost the same as taking an in-person class."
Senior,4,A lot of opportunities are offered here. It is easy to get involved. It is a fairly diverse environment.
Alum,4,The University of Maryland is an awesome school with many top tier programs. It is also a very big school. Students may feel left out and out of place more grassroots programs to help out of state and international students feel more at home would be very helpful.
Sophomore,4,"Took some time for everyone to adjust, but by the end of the semester it felt like everyone had a decent grasp on things."
Sophomore,4,"The people I met and the campus environment (walking along the ""mall"", etc..). Living in freshman dorms is key to meeting new people!"
Freshman,4,My experience at this institution so far has been absolutely excellent. I love that this gives me a chance to grow as a person and develop long term connections with any of my friends that I made on this campus.
Sophomore,4,My instructors understood that the transition was not going to be easy so they did their best to ask us what they could do to make the transition better for us. They were quick to answer emails with any questions as well.
Senior,4,"While taking online classes from UMD, it's been hectic but also the most relaxing time I've had. I would have expected the spring semester to be chaotic, but the professors and their TA's were very understanding of many students' home situations."
Freshman,4,"Communication is key when it comes to the student experience of the college you enroll at. The staff at the University of Maryland College Park are very helpful, and available through phone and email. They are willing to help you you and answer your questions. This has proven to be key to a freshmen like me during the quarantine as I am unable to personally go to the offices and seek out help."
Freshman,4,I am currently enrolled in one of the online modules of the University of Maryland and they are very thorough followed by videos and explanations of what the assignment involves. Very well so far.
Junior,4,Classes are challenging but I get a lot out of them. There are lots of extracurriculars students can participate for recreation and to help the community. The diversity and involvement of the campus.
Sophomore,4,"I overall have really enjoyed by experience at UMD. I love the  students, the campus itself, the social scene. My only critique and something I would like to see change is how the administration conducts itself. Hopefully that will change with the new president taking over."
Sophomore,4,"The online classes that I took were very straight forward and simplified the assignments that needed to be completed. The instructors put out directions usually at the beginning of every week and checked in periodically. However after all classes were transitioned to online, it became very difficult for the courses that were not meant for virtual learning. Those assignments were more difficult to complete and some were canceled. The one thing that you lose during an online class is communication the ability to solve problems quickly. It is difficult to ask questions and navigate complications that come with limited access to the instructors."
Alum,4,I took one class online and the instructors was good. We had to interact with other student through the discussion board.
Alum,4,"You make the university smaller by getting involved in activities, clubs, and organizations. I loved my time with College Park Scholars, America Reads, and honor societies. There are many opportunities to get involved in the local College Park community."
Junior,4,"Some professors are hired based of off knowledge on the subject, no ton teaching, which can prove for difficult learning experiences"
Junior,4,"Lots of opportunities, a wide range of people and activities, and good price for in state students. However, the school could do more for social justice initiatives."
Alum,4,I did not take any online classes but I heard from others that they were good quality. I am actually looking into starting my MBA online program soon.  I am sure I will not be disappointed with the quality of online classes.
Sophomore,4,"The school cares about it students for the most part, trying to give them access to the best resources they can."
Sophomore,4,Attending the University of Maryland has been very good so far. Academically I feel like I am receiving an education that will benefit me in the future. The quality of teachers at the university is good and many of them show that they really care about their students. There is so much help available for students so that our learning experience can be better. I am also very pleased with the type of student life the university provides. There are so many clubs and organizations you can join.
Sophomore,4,Because of the coronavirus pandemic I had to take courses online for the past school year. It was a huge transition but it did not make my learning experience harder. My professors were nice enough to make our online learning experience easier by being more lenient and understanding of the situation. There were obviously some challenges like having to self teach myself more things than usual and having to be more aware of when things were due.
Freshman,4,"I like the campus and people I met so far! There's always something to do! I wish there was more diversity, however."
Alum,4,Good school with a respected name brand.  Proud to have graduated from this public university.  Well-regarded academics.
Sophomore,4,"Campus is always under construction, you'd probably want a bike to get around. Commuting by car is a NIGHTMARE but so are the dorms. However, in my experince, the education is good and the student life is fun."
Freshman,4,"Ultimately, COVID-19 forced the University of Maryland to turn to online classes. Although I was nervous for this transition, I believe that the University of Maryland handled it extremely well. The transition went very smooth and I was able to maintain a strong academic environment. I felt as if my teachers truly cared about my wellbeing in the time more than anything else."
Niche User,4,The University of Maryland has been nothing but supporting during my time. I'm a non-traditional student and the services that the University provides has been extremely helpful.
Niche User,4,The University of Maryland has been nothing but supporting during my time. I'm a non-traditional student and the services that the University provides has been extremely helpful.
Junior,4,"Overall, the university as a whole is a diverse, recollection school that strives to better it's students every step of the way. I believe that the main issue that I find to be most prevalent, at least, in my field, is the lack of funding in certain departments of the school. It is evident which schools receive higher priority and maintenance, where others seem to have been forgotten."
Sophomore,4,"Maryland did a great job adjusting some professors switched better than others; however, overall it was very successful and helpful."
Sophomore,4,"The best thing about this school would be its accepting environment. The school is has a diverse student body, no matter what cultural background or lifestyle you come from, Maryland will always have a spot for you. Although the school is large, you can easily find your niche here. There are a wide variety of classes to choose from compared to a smaller school. There is a ton of school pride. People react positively and have a lot of spirit and passion for the MD Terrapins. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved with so many different things."
Freshman,4,"The University of Maryland is a university with pride unlike any other school. UMD has about 40,000 undergraduate students that consider the campus to be like home, and this gave me the chance to meet a lot of good people so far. Our athletic teams can't be beat, and it's always a great feeling to be apart of the student section no matter the sport. The campus is very large, giving students plenty of space to hang out or do work in. We also have the best and most enthusiastic mascot, Testudo. Testudo statues can be found in several places around campus, and if you give his nose a rub you might find yourself lucky some day. The professors are awesome as well, and their job is fulfilled by seeing their students succeed. Overall great school with even greater people."
Junior,4,"During this time of online learning, I definitely miss UMD a lot. As a junior who was accepted into mechanical engineering after spending a year undecided (College of Letters & Sciences), choosing to stay at UMD was one of the best decisions I ever made. Our campus is always buzzing with people and activities year-round, and there are clubs for literally any interest group you can think of. Despite campus being fairly large, it's very easy to get around and I really don't mind walking 15 minutes to my classes, it's usually less if you live directly on campus and depending on your major/where your classes are generally held. 

One piece of advice I would give specifically about transferring into Engineering is to try to take engineering classes even as an undecided major. While it's possible to graduate on time after transferring, it's a lot more work when you're taking 4 technical classes at once. Overall I love UMD and its programs though and I would highly recommend it!"
Freshman,4,I appreciate the school being mindful of all students and their needs. They offer many activities that are fun and offer many tools to help you get good grades.
Freshman,4,"University of Maryland is a great experience, one that you would expect for a undergraduate (and graduate college). The atmosphere on campus is amazing, from sports to academics. There are so many opportunities to do at UMD and that UMD can provide for. I would say the only downside is the extensive amount of construction going on. It can become very inconvenient for a student's busy schedule and a bit of an eye sore. Other than that, if you're thinking about UMD, go!"
Junior,4,"The University of Maryland has a large and beautiful campus. The downside would be that you will need to walk a lot to get from one end to the other, and it's always under construction. It has a very competitive atmosphere, but everybody is friendly towards each other. It provides many opportunities for students to connect with others and reach their career goals. The dorm quality really depends on where you live, but student's seem to enjoy the dorm life no matter what. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, especially asian cuisine! Besides the beautiful and lively campus, the local area outside campus is sometimes not very safe to walk alone. However, there are usually police that are circling the area and who will gladly give rides for students who do not feel safe."
Freshman,4,"I do like it overall. It has been a great school overall. You do get the traditional college experience, which is something I have always wanted"
Freshman,4,"University of Maryland - College Park is a great University with great students who want the best education possible. The school atmosphere is positive and inviting for people who do not attend the school but just want to explore the campus. The campus itself is big and invites to do new things every single day. The party scene is great and the people there make it great especially on the weekends. You gotta look for the day parties. The food is as expected regular college food; not very good but not bad nonetheless, tolerable."
Sophomore,4,"The academics and professors are amazing, however, the campus food can be improved and there is currently a ton of construction going on making it harder to get around campus and ruining its beauty. It should look better in a couple years though."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Maryland is a good school. We have a fair bit of bureaucratic bullshit, but if you can handle that, this is the school for you. Unless you are disabled. It's not accessible in the slightest - and the Accommodations center is pretty small. In general, the professors are pretty chill - unless you're in the math or computer science departments. There's also a lot of weird/fun stuff that happens around campus, so that's fun."
Sophomore,4,"Love their Scholars program! Learning a lot as an English and Psychology major. I loved the campus, but there's a lot of construction right now, so it's bothersome. Campus is always changing. Campus is also huge!"
Freshman,4,"So far UMD has been a good experience with large student body, many majors, and a diverse student body and faculty. As UMD is a BIG10 school, its athletics and academics are both good with a lot of money going towards both athletics and research opportunities. Since its so close to DC, there are many fellowships, internships, and volunteer opportunities in DC which is great for people who want to work there some day."
Freshman,4,It's a very nice environment and the overall experience was nice. The quality of the dorm halls could be improved.
Freshman,4,We'll I'm a freshmen at the University Of Maryland and I love it. I'm in a AAP program that help Students that don't do so well in school. And it feel's like a big family with the students and the staff. and with out that program my time there would be hard. One thing they I could change is to help student more when it come down to paying the tuition. and have more opptions to pay there bill.
Niche User,4,"During my time visiting at University of Maryland - College Park, I was fascinated and intrigued by the environment surrounding the campus. The campus itself was very elegant and looked appealing in my eyes. The campus was organized in a professional setting and it was very easy to move around from the dorms to the classrooms.  In addition to this, most of the students that I observed walking around campus came from different ethnic backgrounds. The surroundings of the campus contains several shopping centers, restaurants, and residential areas. On the other hand, the only thing that I thought was poor was the student dorms itself. They appeared to be poorly furnished and did not have enough space for two students."
Niche User,4,"It was a really nice school,and is now my top choice. 
The campus is beautiful, the people are amazing!
There is also a variety of food options."
Freshman,4,"The blend of academics and athletics is unique and amazing at UMD. Along with the blend of new and old buildings, brick with glass, the vibe of the school is something you don't want to miss out on."
Sophomore,2,"Most of my professors did try really hard to keep a high quality of education online, however, it simply did not transfer well online. Many students such as myself can not tell you really anything they learned after going online on March and for out-of-state students thats over $10,000 worth of tuition/education wasted."
Graduate Student,2,"If I could give UMD an overall score, it would be a D+. The worst thing about UMD is the racism. I dealt with harassment and assault from Caucasian students all throughout my time there. Whether it be at the Maryland Food Coop ( now closed thankfully) or the dining halls on North or South campus, I dealt with stalking, threatening, and harassment from these students. Maryland does all it can to cover these incidents up. Either that, or they just can’t seem to keep up with them all. I have spoken to several campus presidents about the issue. Nothing seems to change and race bias reports seem to be the norm here. Just be choosy about who you choose to socialize with."
Junior,2,"College Park is a very well known university for the STEM fields; however, the university knows it and the result is a terrible study-life balance. Classes are overly difficult and obtuse, the administration is horrible and there has not been a semester where I have not encountered errors with my account or transcript. 

Most of the professors are decent, even if they are restricted in how they teach their courses. 

On campus housing is a joke, expensive and badly maintained. The dorms had black mold last semester. Off campus housing is horribly expensive due to the proximity to DC."
Junior,2,"Academically the University is very great. Well as far as their criminal justice program. But, their communication is horrible. The financial aid office never answers the phone and when they do they tell you they will call you back. Criminal activities that occur on campus they hide and try to act like it never happens. THEY ARE MONEY HUNGRY MONSTERS! Not only myself but a few others I know have had many problems with having ""balances"" that shouldn't exist. They give excuses as to why they can't communicate to fix account balances, credits, and many other things."
Graduate Student,2,The University of Maryland is an extremely large school where a student has to be extraordinarily vocal to accomplish even minor tasks.  There appears to be a heavy movement towards on-line classes which provide little instruction and almost no instructor involvement.
Sophomore,2,"This University is a money-maker above all else. The administration is my biggest problem here, they do not care at all about students individually or as a whole. Student deaths go unaddressed and ignored. Reslife (administration for campus housing/dorming) is TERRIBLE. They couldn't care less if your roommate is crazy or dangerous and they couldn't care less about a student's **documented** mental health issues. Students are treated like a paycheck by this University not as actual humans. Reslife shows no flexibility or compassion unless the school is still somehow being paid or profiting from you, as if tuition wasn't already enough. You could tell this school you were suicidal and they still wouldn't let you break a housing lease with them; the school is so big that you as 1 person do not matter. GOOD LUCK if by any chance you happen to have an issue with dorms at this University; you'll need it."
Sophomore,2,"Although I do not think UMD is the right fit for me, it is a very great school. While it is racially/ethnically diverse it is still pretty separated in terms of who hangouts with who. I've noticed that there is a divide between minorities and the caucasian people on campus. While the majority of the people on campus are tolerant and open minded, as a minority you can still feel marginalized and not included (I think a lot of this is due to Greek life culture). Also if you are not into sports culture, this is another aspect that can make you feel isolated from the rest of the population on campus. Academically speaking, I have enjoyed my classes at umd and most of my professors have been interesting and nice! I definitely think if you are looking for a school that is very racially and socially inclusive this might not be the best option."
Niche User,2,The college itself is very good academically and gives undergrads a lot of opportunities to succeed.
Senior,2,"I don't feel like a student in most of my classes, I feel like a number. Most of my teachers brag about how they get money from making us buy a certain text book that we never even use. "
College Junior,2,The greek life at my school is really cliquey. Some of them require that you be in the frat to get inside their house
College Junior,2,"There have been multiple occasions where sexual assaults happen and ""peeping tom"" situations."
College Sophomore,2,"On campus, students often feel safer than being off campus. The police department has virtually no presence on campus and is not helpful when called. The email and text notifications from the police department which are sent out after a crime/incident are very often too late and not helpful without significant context."
College Junior,2,"I would never suggest anyone transfer into the university of maryland because everything from choosing a major, registering for classes, having access to important information, and even seeing your advisor is close to impossible."
College Freshman,2,Dorm room space is far too small for two men.
College Sophomore,2,I'm not a fan of the greeks I've met. They have been rude during classes and unhelpful during group projects so far.
College Junior,2,Campus Housing is not that great for students far from the campus.
College Senior,2,"hated elkton hall, needs air conditioning, RA was not respectful, much better in off campus housing and greek housing"
College Sophomore,2,Many students drink and/or use drugs on campus.
College Junior,2,"I feel like the on-campus housing could use a serious upgrade. Students are paying thousands of dollars to reside comfortably on the campus to receive a quality education. There should not be one dorm without functioning elevators, heat/cooling systems, etc. This school allocates so much money to the athletic/sports departments, ipads and scooters for athletes, and building new academic buildings when they should be allocating some of those funds to remodeling the on-campus dorms/apartments. Athletes may attract national attention on the scoreboards, but the working students are what gives this school high ratings in forbes/kiplingler due to high graduation rates. In regards to living off-campus in apartments such as Varsity or The View, or in private-public ownership housing such as Courtyards/Commons, it is very expensive! The apartments are this school's biggest financial scam. What working college student can support a $1,000 monthly rent while still taking 12-15 credits without the help of their parents? A low percentage. I live in Courtyards, the cheapest off-campus apartments ($800+), and it has not been such a wonderful experience for me besides the free parking. It is very dingy and old looking, the amenities are old, the decor is gross, and it attracts little attention other than the price. Do better UMD."
College Freshman,2,There are some crimes on campus. It is not considered low on crimes however.
College Freshman,2,I got one of the worst dorms.
College Senior,2,some of the worst people you could ever want to run into are Greeks here. I hate them all SO much
College Sophomore,2,"Many dorms are not equal. Some dorms will be small while other have a lot of room. Many buildings do not have air conditioning, so the beginning of the year and the end of the year are very hot in the dorms without air conditioning. Some rooms also have no screen on the windows, making it possible for bugs to enter any time the windows are open"
College Student,2,I had really hoped to get a scholarship but I didn't and I don't know why.
College Freshman,2,"As an out-of-state student, it's pretty rough."
College Freshman,2,Apartments are pretty expensive for decent quality
College Freshman,2,You get the same options basically everyday
College Freshman,2,"Some people I know love the financial aid and others don't like it too much. In my opinion, UMD isn't really known for giving out a lot of financial aid, but will give a little."
College Freshman,2,College Park is very hasty in giving aid
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid they give isn't a lot and scholarships are really hard to receive.
College Junior,2,I have not received any financial aid and the process is long and tedious.
College Freshman,2,The whole process was confusing. First semester I received a refund check and the second semester they just subtracted it from my tuition without my knowledge.
College Freshman,2,"I do not have a meal plan but the few times I have ate at the diner I did not like the food, nor did I like the price."
College Freshman,2,I applied for financial aid and did not receive any.
College Sophomore,2,It's basically impossible for in-state students to get good financial aid.
College Freshman,2,"The parks can be gorgeous in spring. This place has virtually the worst amenities of any American city I've spent time in. Few shops that aren't burgers/pizza/etc. One board game place opened up which is alright. Zero cafes outside of the Starbucks - not the kind of place where you can converse with strangers. No music scene at all, though a few expensive jazz clubs in DC. The Farmer's Market has a little of what should be available year-round, and is ok. I don't think there is even a real bookstore in the entire city, outside the limited campus B&N. The only museums are the national ones in DC, and they rarely show anything recent and non-political. There are 3 independent movie theaters in neighboring cities, though they rarely have any special events. No DIY culture. Really, no culture outside of frat life. You need a car to get decent groceries. You need to go to a different city or use the internet to get almost any speciality item of any kind (clothes, art or construction supplies, film cameras, specialty ingredients, or... BOOKS, etc.). While most major American cities lack some of these, the DC/CP area lacks nearly all of them. Baltimore is a breath of fresh air when you can get there - I tend to save almost all of my shopping for weekends when I can visit."
College Freshman,2,There's effectively nothing for you if you are not into frat parties. No music culture whatsoever.
College Junior,2,Don't like city of College Park because it is generally unsafe.
College Freshman,2,Scholarships mainly go to athletes.
College Freshman,2,The food is very unhealthy and it gets tiring very fast. There is little to none vegetarian options and towards the end of the semester when students are trying to spend their leftover points they start a spending limit. This causes students to have money left over at the end of the semester which they can not get back. Adeles is the best place on campus to get food for dinner.
College Junior,2,"Extremely expensive, but that's the DC market"
College Junior,2,"There are a few places but none are close by and those that are contain cheap, fast food."
College Junior,2,"The dorms are very small, not always clean, very loud, and there is little community atmosphere. It is very difficult to get placed into ""good"" housing and impossible to return to on-campus housing once one has left campus housing."
College Junior,2,"The school is constantly raising tuition prices and because there are so many students, there is not enough (or the office does not care enough) aid to assist those who truly need it. It is best to go and speak directly with an advisor which is also difficult, so be resilient and keep trying until they help you!"
College Freshman,2,"The only reason I got any financial aid was because I applied to SO many scholarships. I applied to almost 53 scholarships and only received 8 of those, but those 8 covered what I needed during the first semester. Now I need more scholarships so the process will start all over again."
College Freshman,2,"Because its such a big school, it is very difficult to get financial assistance. scholarships are competitively fought for. I suggest applying to many outside scholarships rather than the ones at your school"
College Freshman,2,I barely received any financial aid. And it's pretty annoying.
College Junior,2,New policy is not considerate at all.
College Junior,2,Local area is dangerous at night.
College Junior,2,There are not a lot of affordable options.
College Freshman,2,"College Park is not a nice area but it is only a 10 minute Metro ride into DC and not a very far train ride or drive up to Baltimore, both of which have plenty going on."
College Freshman,2,You have to score highly on tests to get a scholarship. I had great GPA but not great scores and received no money but grant.
College Freshman,2,Hard to find parties as freshmen male unless you pay or join frat
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few options if you are vegan or vegetarian especially in south campus. Save your money, and buy the cheapest dinning plan possible and go eat at the Stamp Co-op instead."
College Sophomore,2,"Housing sucks, and its overly expensive. Upperclassmen have greater priority to get on campus housing which makes no sense, since they are expected to get apartments of their own."
College Senior,2,Our administration has cracked down a lot on the off-campus party scene over the past two years
College Freshman,2,too many of the same food restaurants
College Junior,2,I have not heard much about safety problems on-campus but when I do it is something along the lines of robbery and once I heard something about a girl being sexually assaulted in one of the buildings I used to go to rather frequently.
College Junior,2,"Socially guys and girls are not very inclusive and it is hard to make friends if you yourself are not outgoing. Most people are friends with people that live in the same dorm building, are on a sports team together, went to the same high school, or anything else that would allow them to stay in contact for more than just a semester (sorority or fraternity). People who are not as outgoing may end up with a semester long friend who they never talk to after the class they share ends. So my advice is to live on campus or join clubs to make life long friends."
College Junior,2,"If you live on North Campus (which you most likely will as a freshman unless you're a Freshman Connection student), you will live in the stereotypical dorm: small, resembling a jail cell, with a questionable air conditioner. It's also pretty far from campus and the night life. It is definitely livable and the perks are that you are close to the diner and the best gym on campus. South campus dorms are apartment style and really nice, but much harder to get into."
Sophomore,1,Many professors do not realize they are not qualified to be sole online teachers yet make no effort to learn how to be efficient on the internet. They make it very difficult to find assignments to complete; often times the assignments are scattered throughout Canvas and the professors take too long to reply back to students.
Sophomore,1,"I did not enjoy my experience at UMD-CP. The campus and the people were not inviting. A lot of the atmosphere was negative and I did not feel like I truly belonged at the school. Unfortunately, this meant that I had to transfer out. The location and the cost of living is too expensive for mediocrity."
Senior,1,This college clearly would prefer it if students just paid tuition and did not show up. Out of the 3 colleges I have attended UMD is the worst.
Senior,1,"Most of the teachers I have had in my department are awful. I had better professors at community college. Also, customer service is terrible and the parking situation is bad and getting worse now that they are removing parking for students to replace it with the metro."
Sophomore,1,"If I could give zero stars, I would. University has become too large to properly address issues and resolve/communicate in a timely fashion.  You cannot get anyone in any office to step up and make a decision. If you try to escalate your complaint or issue to the President, you will not have the opportunity to be heard. Too big and too disorganized to care about the individual student.  A huge disappointment!"
Freshman,1,"From the beginning, I was not in love with this school. And sadly, the University of Maryland proved to me exactly why I shouldn’t. This school does not value diversity or care about hate crimes, student safety, students’ futures; completely falsifying its values. Living on a campus where you receive an alert every week for either a robbery, stabbing, shooting, harassment, etc is sad. 1000 Characters is not enough to explain the hatred and racism on this campus either. From a fraternity having a noose hanging in their house, to hate speech on the sidewalks, and even a White-Supremacist stabbing a Black student to death in the act of hate crime. During the school year students demanded change on this campus and constantly we were denied. Denied safety, diversity, a voice. Imagine sending your son or daughter to a campus that deems to not value his/her life. They want these reviews to say I love this university, but how can you love a university that doesn’t love you back."
Niche User,1,I hate this school so much. The people where so annoying and it is such a party school. The only good thing about the school is the barn and the psychology department.
Recent Alumnus,1,"PHILIP MERRILL COLLEGE OF JOURNALISM SUCKS! NOT ALL UNDERGRADUATE BROADCAST JOURNALISM STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED TO CNS-TV AND THE VIEWFINDER. THE GRADUATE STUDENTS GET ALL THE FREEDOM AND BENEFITS. IF YOU ARE AN UNDERGRAD, YOU ARE TOTALLY SCREWED IF YOU DO NOT GET INTO CNS-TV AND THE VIEWFINDER. PHILIP MERRILL COLLEGE OF JOURNALISM SERIOUSLY FAILS THEIR UNDERGRADUATE BROADCAST JOURNALISM STUDENTS."
Recent Alumnus,1,PHILIP MERRILL COLLEGE OF JOURNALISM SUCKS!
Recent Alumnus,1,"Phiiip Merrill College of Journalism really sucks. Capital News Service TV / Maryland Newsline and The ViewFinder only admits 7-8 undergraduate broadcast journalism students. No CNS and No ViewFinder = no job after college. The school only focus on graduate students who are the only ones to get into the program. This school sucks and I regret coming here. SCREW THE PHILIP MERRILL COLLEGE OF JOURNALISM! Capital News Service and The ViewFinder are neither  a real television news station / news station  structure environment nor the real-world television news exerience. Please go to another journalism school.  UMD, Philip Merrill College of Journalism, Capital News Service TV / Maryland Newsline, and the ViewFinder are not worth it. It is all a waste of time. The journalism school do not care about their students. They didn't care about me and they won't care about you or the next person."
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms are of terrible quality unless you are lucky enough to live in one of the two new constructions. The process of dealing with problems when they arise in the dorms is impossible. The department of resident life is ignorant in their approach to problem-solving, and I have been convinced never to live on campus again."
College Senior,1,like I said. Professors are NOT helpful and do not care if you pass or not because you're just another number because classes are huge and they only care about their research. tests are miserable in every single way.
College Senior,1,establishing a social life is impossible for transfer students. its clique-y because friend groups were established in their little dorms freshman year. professors and advisers are miserable. so intimidating to approach and they do NOT care about your individual success since the class has literally 200 students. tests are unreasonable in both grading and difficulty. math department is horrible. I have to teach myself everything. This school left me in ruins and made me miserable for a year. completely and utterly miserable. do not go here.
College Freshman,1,"There are 8(/9?) pizza places. The only vegetarian is extremely greasy (I'm not even vegetarian, but sometimes I don't want a bar food burger). There are no delis or anything like that outside of 7-11esque campus stores to buy small servings of fruits or vegetables or a la carte food. Good cheap produce is hard to find. No real ethnic food (no Indian/Punjabi, Mexican, Italian, Lebanese, ...) around campus. A few decent Indian and Salvadorian places in Langley Park, accessible by car. Even the grocery choices are kind of skimpy, though there is a metro to DC which goes right to Trader Joe's - which has better food than almost every place in CP. I've gotten food poisoning from every major bar in the area. That said, DC and Silver Spring have some amazing Ethiopian."
College Junior,1,"If you're a big or picky eater, a buffet style dining hall suits you best. There is only one on campus and your dining plan only allows you to eat there once per week, it's only open M-F 5:30-8pm and closed on the weekends. If you dare to eat here beyond your allotted once/week plan, it's $19 per meal. 

The only other dining hall is an a la carte style, and crazy expensive too. Mostly junk food. I had 2 pieces of pizza, a salad, a soda, and a piece of cake, and IT COST $26!!!!!!!!!!

I realize this is the DC area, but UMD is seriously taking advantage of their students with these prices. 

Oh, and they hit you other ways too... like $281 PER SEMESTER FOR PARKING!!!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"I was put on academic probation and i lost my financial aid. They say since there was no ""extenuating circumstance"", I can never get it back."
College Sophomore,1,No very good quality and the point system is very poor
College Junior,1,"The local area has very high crime and is notorious for being a low socio-economic, unsafe area. While Washington, D.C. and Baltimore are relatively close by, the surround city and neighborhoods  have little variety and are very run down."
College Sophomore,1,"Lets face it, Maryland is not the richest public school. Therefore the financial aid and scholarships/grant options are not very good. They do however have some good payment plans."
College Sophomore,1,The admission to get into umd was interesting and different but enrolling into an LEP major is unnecessarily difficult.
College Sophomore,1,I received no financial aid which is why I am applying for scholarships.
College Sophomore,1,Its really hard trying to get financial aid from my school.
College Sophomore,1,I do not like that they some what run the school. They basically dictate the social life on campus.
College Freshman,1,The food is disgusting and gave me stomach pains every time I ate.
College Junior,1,International students do not receive financial aid. It is a struggle.
College Freshman,1,"DOTS will fine anyone not in their correct parking space because thats how they make their money, so they are after everyone!"
College Freshman,1,"Don't get me wrong, I love Greek Life but it's become a click. I cant tell you the number of times I've wanted to go to a party at in Frat Row, but I've been scared because you're looked down if you're not in a sorority of fraternity, or if your closest friends are not in one either. We're all alumni and should all be encouraged to party or hang out together."
College Senior,1,The parking policies at our school are barbaric
College Freshman,1,People are not disciplined. They usually come back drunk.
College Freshman,1,"I did not receive any aid and my parents are struggling to keep me in school. I spent over $500 on textbooks and i still need to pay $10000 for my tuition, fees, room and board. And i happen to be an in-state student."
College Sophomore,1,"As an out-of-state transfer student I receive NO aid from UMD. Although my community college GPA was 3.9 and I'm maintaining a similar GPA here I get nothing. My EFC is around $100 so I get federal aid but even after submitting additional applications and going in person to plead with the aid office the best they could do was a $2000 loan (note that out-of-state tuition is around $30,000). I'm probably going to take a year break after this semester because I just can't do this. "
College Student,1,Basically if you are not from another country or one of twelve children you will recieve NO financial aid. 
College Freshman,1,Off-campus housing is very expensive for the area it is located it in. It also makes it difficult to participate in on campus events or meet new people.
College Junior,1,"the food is terrible
its unhealthy and gross
it gets really boring really fast and costs so much for the food and portions
cooking on your own is the best option, and off campus food is decent and pretty available
meal plan is mediocre"
College Junior,1,"Parking is ridiculous
you will get a million tickets, theres never parking, appealing tickets is insane
it sucks. avoid at all costs"
College Senior,1,All of the campus scholarships are for agricultural students or too specific for any student to have the chance of getting or even qualified to apply. You're better of applying to nationwide scholarships.
College Junior,1,"The Art Department is very disorganized and difficult to communicate with. A nightmare every time I need to speak with an advisor (most likely, I never will). However, as art is my passion, I would, unfortunately, do it all over again."
College Freshman,1,I don't have a car but its a well known fact that you cant make it a year without getting a ticket.
College Sophomore,1,"I'm still in the process of getting into the business school. It's a very competitive program and I don't necessarily know if I will get in, but I'm hoping for the best. There are multiple requirements to get selected such as required classes, student involvement, 3.5 GPA, teacher recommendation, along with your personal statement and a resume."
College Sophomore,1,"College Park is still in development and there are many sketchy areas. There is a fair amount of crime around campus and it is located next to a highway. There are a few bars in town, but overall there is not too much to do. Construction is also ongoing throughout the campus itself."
Recent Alumnus,1,Finding spots on campus is almost impossible for visitors.  Parking permit prices are outrageous and usually not helpful since the lot you get will be a mile from your dorm.  The Department of Transportation give tickets like there is no tomorrow so make sure to not park in the wrong lot or to return to your car a minute after your time is up!
College Sophomore,1,"I don't have a car myself but I try to find friends with cars instead. Looking at my friends, it's always difficult to find parking. Even when my parents just drop me off at school, it's hard for them to find parking. However, most places you can get by just by walking on foot."
College Junior,1,Parking is one of the things that could definitely improve. If you don't have to drive then don't unless you commute. If you commute make sure you are careful were you park if you don't have a parking pass. The cops WILL give you tickets.
College Junior,1,There are very few options and most are very expensive.  Not very good with working with financial aid.
College Sophomore,1,"Permit costs are reasonable, permits for any college tend to be in the hundreds. As a Freshman parking on campus is a pain, but that's to be expected. Campus parking police is a nightmare, they are serious sticklers. Parking at the near by apartment complexes also is a nightmare, they all require permits and will tow you if you've only been parked there for 15 minutes... (I know from experience)."
College Senior,1,Transportation Department is a nightmare. Will give you tickets for anything and everything! Stay in your lot or else you will pay
College Sophomore,1,they have the same menu running every day with one meal changing daily the food is often cold and barely seasoned
College Sophomore,1,Parking sucks. unless you have a permit you cant park anywhere on campus without paying the exorbitant parking fees of about 2 bucks an hour. You can park for free without a permit in certain places but only from 4pm to 7am and in some places only on weekends. you dont really need a car because the shuttle service will take you anywhere you need to go that isnt walking distance. The campus bus system is excellent but the parking situation is expensive and time consuming and its better to just walk or metro anywhere you need to go.
College Junior,1,"I hate campus dining, extremely unhealthy and very costly."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is not fun. It is difficult to find a reasonable parking spot and if you go over the limit of your parking meter, the campus police will reprimand you immediately."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is the worst on campus. Because so many people request parking, they made more, however, this has made them compact and difficult to get into."
College Junior,1,"I really do like it, the time is very flexible and I was taking my classes online and I moved and my internet wasn't work. I really need the money to finish school."
College Sophomore,1,Parking at UMD is absolutely terrible. Most of the lots are not labelled quickly and the department of transportation gives tickets out like they're candy on Halloween.
College Junior,1,The Department of Transportation Services (DOTS) gives out tickets far too frequently. I do not know one person on this campus who has not gotten a parking ticket.
College Freshman,1,I am an honors student and I didn't receive anything.
College Sophomore,1,Parking can be horrendous on this campus. The one positive is that freshmen are allowed to bring their cars. The downside to that is that you will probably be parking pretty far away and will likely be assigned to a lot that makes you move your car for every home football/men's basketball game. Also almost anywhere you park that is not your assigned lot will result in a $75 ticket. Lots also fill up quickly especially during the day but for the most part you should be able to find a spot even though it may be a lot further away from everything.
College Senior,1,Trying to find a parking spot can be a nightmare. There are many ways to end up with a parking ticket.
College Senior,1,I don't even have a car on-campus but I have seen first had just how terrible it is. The designation system is also kind of strange but it hasn't really hurt me when I've taken class over the summer.
College Freshman,1,"Coming here from out of state is torture, unless you are the next sports star or you are the next albert einstein. They give out-of-state students the least amount of grant money, and have fewer scholarships available to them. I love this school, but it is killing my pockets to stay here. Plus I wasn't a bad high school student at all, I was extremely bright, and yet I am still struggling to pay for college. However for in-state students, Maryland tend to be better in the financial aid section. They give more grants and have more scholarships available."
College Freshman,1,"There's nothing to do in College Park (if you're under 21) except eat. If you're looking for something to do, you have to take a bus into DC."

Sophomore,5,Online learning has been wonderful! I’ve been able to complete my entire degree while working full time and on my own time.
Junior,5,"Now that we are in covid times, we are all online. There have been some bumps but it has been good so far."
Senior,5,The class was excellent and so were the Professors. The classes are very informative and the professors are more than willing to help if you have any question what so ever. I really enjoyed my time at National University.
Senior,5,"Staff and Professors are amazing. They give you plenty or real-world
situations and tasks. They are also very helpful in leading you in the right direction."
Junior,5,I like how we just focus on one class at a time and that they're only 4 weeks. I like the flexibility of doing online school because I can do it on my own time.
Junior,5,"Living in a different state, being able to do the entire degree online was important. The faculty was accommodating and provided numerous resources."
Alum,5,"I went to National University long before online classes became available.  I noticed some say the school is a scam, diploma mill or a rip-off.  I noticed that National in rankings has a relatively low graduation rate of somewhere between 12% and 14%.  There you go.  If you aren't prepared with your feet on the ground from day one, one month per class goes by so fast, you'll find yourself scrambling or worse, failing your course.  I assume the same time flies in the online program.  I'm quite proud to be a National MBA grad and despite those who might be critical, I never found my degree as an impediment to being hired or promoted within my career.  It's about how I present myself and how I perform.  Finish the program, get your diploma and use it as an asset.  You will find that to be the case.  And, if given a choice I'll hire a National MBA before I'll hire a state school MBA any day of the week.  I've been to a state school and I graduated from National.  I know the difference."
Junior,5,"Fast paced, accelerated study and I will finish a year early as long as I stay on task. The professors are very accessible and have been able to answer all of my questions in a way that has been beneficial for me. I also appreciate the free resources available such as the math and writing center where I am able to get even further assistance. For my last business plan, I went to the writing center and was helped step by step on how to make my plan even better. So far I have a 4.0 gpa and hope to continue to maintain that."

Graduate Student,5,I liked the versatility of the institution. The school accommodated all possible types of students from foreign to financially strapped including working class or stay at home mothers.
Graduate Student,5,"Online classes were the best. The course shell was easy to navigate, professors were accessible when needed and interaction with fellow classmates was encouraged and helpful."
Alum,5,"Amazingly great education!  
BSCS 1985 Summa Cum Laude

It's been a while but I remember clearly that what was given emphasis in the Computer Science program turned out to be perfect for the exploding ""high tech"" revolution.  The CS program wasn't geared just to train for the IT field, it was Engineering level and cutting edge at that.

I also remember that even subjects I didn't much care for were taught so well by highly knowledgeable faculty that were working in those very same fields in their day jobs.  All of my technical instructors were great engineers as well, inspiring me to think about my chosen profession in new ways I hadn't previously considered.

I've just finished a long & rewarding career, and everything I learned at NU was with me all the way through as a great foundation that I continued to build on throughout my career.

I really didn't get just a degree at NU, I got a real ground-truth education that served me continuously for a third of a century.  Thank you NU!"
Graduate Student,5,"This school is easy! I always thought applying to grad school was going to be difficult. The application took less than 20 min, no essay, and the advising counselors are all super friendly and ready to help. Best decision I have made!"
Junior,5,I am enrolled in the on-line program.  It's a great way to go to school at night and work in the day time - for me as a substitute teacher.
Senior,5,"Online classes, 1 per month, accelerated degree program, great teachers, online support and knowledgeable counselors."
Alum,5,I’m a graduate of National University. I appreciated not only the quality of the professors but also the convenience of the classes and love their library. I greatly benefited from the degree I received and may go back for my masters if I can find the time.
Senior,5,"I love the school and the people who attend alongside myself.  I have gone to a few different schools over the years but I have stuck with National because I like the military tuition discount and the curriculum.  I am challenged in the coursework and reading requirements.  I have always taken online/distant learning courses through NU, and between work, home-life and schoolwork, I am certainly challenged.  I would recommend this school to everyone!"
Graduate Student,5,"National University allowed me to be able to work and study at the same time. At the pace of one class per month or one class per two months, I am able to work around that schedule to help me fulfill my goals."
Junior,5,"Very good school. The advisors help you along the whole way. They were a short phone call or email away. Classes were one month long, which was very rigorous and time was of the essence. Not an easy school by means but good for working parents."
Senior,5,I really enjoy the flexibility of having in class and online classes that take 4 weeks to complete. I haven't had a bad experience with any professors and it has helped me to achieve my degree in the fastest manner possible.
Sophomore,5,I have month long courses that are offered to me through the military. I love the fast paced but informative courses.
Graduate Student,5,"It is a great program for those who are working class. Its very flexible, professors are insightful and willing to create meaningful relationships and academic advisers are very helpful."
Graduate Student,5,So far great service and fast responses to questions. The single log in is very nice and easy to use systems make it possible to focus on the learning. There is flexibility in the programs as the classes are offered online or in person. One month per class makes it easy to focus on one course at a time.
Alum,5,"During my college education, I was employed full-time in healthcare and a full-time student. I can honestly tell you that National University block program with one-month courses is what allowed me to receive a Bachelors in Public Health and encouraging me to go back to school! Thank you , NU I hope all students appreciate the unique system you offer ."
Freshman,5,This is a great school for any current active duty military as well as non military. The online courses were easy to follow although the fast paced 1 month per course can set you behind if you do not manage your time wisely.
Sophomore,5,I’m currently doing all my classes online. I like how they offer different programs for people that have a busy schedule or can’t go to campus. I like what I learn from the classes I take. I would like to finish all my degrees with National if possible.
Junior,5,National University has been a great school experience for me. I have gone to many schools looking to complete my Bachelors is Nursing and National has by FAR been the most accommodating and helpful. Thank you National
Senior,5,The professors really care about you. If you have a question they always have an answer and go above and beyond for their students.
Junior,5,I love the experience of learning online.  Learning online gives me the freedom to work and take care of my ailing grandparents as well as get my degree.
Alum,5,"Great military access online for those on active duty attending online or satellite classes; adaptable instructors, understanding and caring staff."
Freshman,5,I like that the classes are fast-paced one month classes.  I also like that we can choose to have online or on campus classes.
Freshman,5,"National University is a school that allows Clark County School District employees or any student a chance to full fill a college degree at a fast pace. It helps employees of the Clark County School District, as myself, become a licensed teacher with the convenience of taking classes online. I, Kaira Mendez, am a full time single mom and employee. The fact that I am able to complete courses online from the comfort of my home gives me ease in not missing any time with my children. National University works with the students very well in helping them organize their classes, setting them up with financial aid, or any matter. I would recommend any one interested in starting their college experience to attend National University."
Senior,5,"National University offers the education for the nursing career I have always wanted to pursue. The staff ,especially my professors, are actively involved in my learning and offer resources to help me around the clock. The only changes I wish to see would be closer program locations to where I live."
Graduate Student,5,Excellent school with AWESOME INSTRUCTORS!!!! They are responsive... set time aside to assist you!! They are very welcoming!!
Senior,5,The one class a month allows me to focus on the subject while giving it my all. Campuses are centrally located and really nice. The professors are experienced in the field they are teaching so real world examples are always fun.
Senior,5,I love the nursing programs that it offers because it helps me fulfill my nursing career within two years.
Senior,5,I enjoyed my experience at National University. Classes are online and go quickly each month. I liked all of my professors at National University were slways willing to help and they were very infomative.
Junior,5,"National University has been extremely supportive with assisting me with the pursuit of my education goals.  As an active duty service member, my schedule is always changing.  There 4 week classes make learning fun, interactive and it all fits into my schedule."
Alum,5,"They have a great library, Veterans Office, Admissions Process and a variety of campus locations. The professors were knowledgeable in their fields of study. They offer a great selection of in person, online and hybrid course offerings. The pace is rigorous and tuition is a bit high per class but this is an expensive area so they have to pay their overhead too."
Junior,5,"This is a great place to start a college career at. You are given time to manage school, work, and family all at the same time"
Junior,5,It's been good so far. Staff are very helpful and friendly! The school tries to accommodate you as best they can with respect to the clinical rotation in the Nursing program which I greatly appreciate.
Junior,5,"I love the class format of 4 weeks for non-lab classes and 8 weeks for lab science classes! It's pretty intense, but if you are trying to knock out your goals as quickly as you can, this is the way to go! Having most of my classes online really is nice too because I can log in at my own leisure for the most part, and do my assignments when I'm not working."
Senior,5,You are sure to have instructors with a wealth of knowledge and expertise for every class you sign up for.
Senior,5,So far I have no bad experiences with National University. The advisors are quick to respong to questions and the financial aid rep is quick to answer questions too. The courses are very detailed and some are harder than others but are tolerable. The ease of starting the courses every month is smooth and the instructors are always there when you need them.
Junior,5,"This is the 4th college I have attended. I am working on my second degree. Never in my time at a college, have I ever felt more wanted, respected, and welcome. NU is doing wonders to bridge the gap between students and faculty. It really is a great school"
Freshman,5,"I am in the 4 year Pre-Law program; and so far, I have had nothing but a great experience with the courses and website interaction. Most efficient online database I’ve used thus far!"
Senior,5,I like that National fits into my schedule. The Professors have all been very helpful and supportive in my own learning of the curriculum. The online platform paired with field experience have helped my understanding of the education curriculum and helps reinforce my understanding of the subject matter.
Graduate Student,5,The thing I like most about National University is that you take one course per month as a student. So this will enable you to concentrate on one course at a time and perform very well.
Graduate Student,5,"I am currently a graduate student studying Human Resources.  I absolutely love my classes, my peers and all of my professors.  The interaction and conversation in class provides perspective and insight for my studies."
Graduate Student,5,I like that I can do an online program.  You have to stay on top of your paperwork and have to be self disciplined.  It relies a lot on you.
Junior,5,i love this university. it is very accommodating with my unpredictable work schedule. The school has accelerated courses i take full advantage of.
Freshman,5,"I'm going to NU's online program. they're not a traditional college so there isn't dorms, or athletics. The campus' I've been too are beautiful and up to date."
Senior,5,"Going to an online college gives me the flexibility to continue my education while going to work full time. If I had to go to a traditional college, I would spend too much time juggling multiple classes and work. This way I get to streamline my focus to a single class instead of being in a three ring circus. I love it!"
Junior,5,"I have started my education with National University and like the change from the Community College format to an accelerated course curriculum in order to complete one class per month.  This allows you to focus on one course at a time and move to the next subject after you earn your ""A"". You can complete your degree in quickly and efficiently.  My campus also has free parking - what more could you want?"
Graduate Student,5,I've had an amazing experience at National.  The academic advisors are always in contact with you. The teachers give a lot of great information. Many assignments but online worked well with my work schedule!
Sophomore,5,It is a great school. All my Professors have their Doctorate Degree and are very knowledgeable.  Class cohorts are  accessible and students have a great bond. Professors support the students and expand their critical thinking. I would like to see the availability of having the school supply books for the co-hort.
Freshman,5,My mother has worked at national university for four years now. I just started my self last November and I have to say I really enjoy the flexibility that National provides.
Freshman,5,Incredible opportunities and networking chances. My life has been enriched with the professionalism of the staff or the faculty and how convenient the locations are and how many classes are offered.
Freshman,5,so far my experience at national university has been amazing. the advisors and instructors tend to my ever learning need and leave no question unanswered. I highly recommend this school.
College Senior,5,flexible with my classes. I love online
Sophomore,4,"Classes are accelerated, making obtaining a degree a quick process. Majority of the advisors are not very helpful so you must be ready to be your own advocate"
Junior,4,National University provides courses online and is great school for those majoring in education. Being able to take new courses every month is something I do prefer to cut down the time needed to graduate.
Junior,4,I have taken a few online courses so far and my experience has been positive. The instructors as well as my peers have been supportive and helpful. Taking classes online has been incredibly convenient especially during the pandemic.
Junior,4,"I have taken all my courses online and it can get challenging to keep up with the work, but for the most part professors are usually available by email for any questions or concerns. The due dates for assignments are known when the course starts so I can plan ahead and make sure I get it done on time."
Alum,4,"It was okay. Professors were used to doing things online, so everything was smooth. The  online application used was fine, no hitches in using it."
Junior,4,The staff is very helpful. I was grateful to find such a thorough sports psychology program completely online.
Alum,4,"I took courses in a classroom environment, not online.  I assume online is as challenging as in the classroom."
Senior,4,There are many factors that I like about National University. One of the many factors include the ability to have the flexibility to have classes at home and have weekly meetings about the assignments.  One particular factor that I would like to see changed if possible would be the ability to partake and be present in physical classes. There is no substitution in my perspective of that of being able to directly collaborate with the instructor and other students.
Senior,4,"National University has provided for me the opportunity to continue my path to higher education. My goals to utilize my Master's Degree from National University are to teach part time at a college level. I strongly believe that the teachers here are very supportive but there is a lack on a personal level due to the classes being online. Besides the online classes, the curriculum is understandable with the help of the instructors who are very responsive and understandable of each individuals specific situations. Overall, I would recommend this school to attain a degree in regards of Higher Education or Teaching as with today's society we are leaning more towards adapting technology into our classrooms. With achieving a degree from University of Phoenix, you can adapt and learn how to better teach from an online standpoint."
Graduate Student,4,My experience with the school has been great so far. All the people I have come in contact with are super polite and the advisors are amazing!
Graduate Student,4,"So far, they have been very receptive and helpful.
My stumbles are in getting access to scholarships and funding. 
I like that they are available during the weekend, but it is still frustrating not to be able to establish a login.
I believe that help during the week may be easier to get."
Junior,4,"I love the ease of online access and being an adult with a 9-5 job. Very grateful that they have made this so easy to start and continue education. The staff is very responsive and available to answer all kinds of questions. The one thing that is frustrating is that there are some technical issues with some of their platforms and they tend to give their students the go-around. I reached out to several ""student resources"" and all of them pushed the responsibility off to another. In the end I had to figure out what to do myself and although that is not ideal the assignment was still completed."
Graduate Student,4,Great flexibility of classes. Great advisers. Some professors were not that engaged with the students and were unfamiliar with the software they were asking the students to use. All of my professors except 2 were great and I completed my BS and I am currently working on my MPH.
Junior,4,I have taken about five course with National and it is usually a good experience. I have had a few professors that have not been as interactive as I'd like.
Junior,4,The classes are very conducive for working students and busy schedules. Sometimes the professors are not as quick to respond or upload grades which can be difficult since the classes are only 4 weeks long.
Graduate Student,4,"I completed my undergrad in Business Management. Hands down, their technology and blackboard were very functional and the instructors and staff are supportive of their student.  They definitely took the time out the ensure you succeed and that meant a great deal to me being a military member."
Junior,4,"The support from the advisors and professors is astounding, especially compared to another private four-year university I attended. The four- and eight-week classes are amazing. They allow you to focus on one course at a time while also completing classes at an accelerated rate. The financial aid office could be more transparent and supportive."
Graduate Student,4,"National University's online programs are great for the working professional. The one-month course length is intense, but also allows for a dedicated online classroom experience. I would highly recommend National University to anyone who is working part or full-time who needs to complete a certification or is looking to switch careers."
Freshman,4,It has been a breeze to take classes with this school. They had the major I was looking for entirely online and that was very important to me.
Junior,4,This school is fast paced but also very student friendly.  They love working with Veterans or Veteran Spouses.
Junior,4,It is a great school for those that are working full time. They are very flexible with your schedule. You can go to school during the days or nights. Classes are not difficult to find. You can take classes online and classes are accelerated and you can finish a class in a month.
Alum,4,"Counselors were very helpful, professors were always available, graded quickly and very knowledgeable. The university offers a lot of support and alumni benefits."
Graduate Student,4,I like the fast pace 4 week classes as well as taking a month off when I need it. The teachers are very knowledgeable in the subjects that they teach. What I would like to see changed in the teacher credential program is students can work on the California Educator Credentialing Assessments while taking courses needed to become a credential teacher.
Junior,4,"National University is amazing for busy students. I am currently active duty in the military and love how the university works with my time and schedule. Many online classes are available, the admin office is very easy to contact and I get a great active duty discount. The only thing I would change would be the tuition. It is so expensive. Even with my discount and my tuition assistance I am having to take out a loan."
Senior,4,"Once you enter National University, you are already preparing for the real world. It may be tough while studying but once you graduate, it will be easier for you because you are confident that your skills are ready for the professional field."
Graduate Student,4,Great for online and busy adults. Most professors are very flexible but care about your learning experience.
Freshman,4,National University gives you flexibility online classes to work around your schedule for working people. I like online because you can take your computer any were to study. Classes are not long they 4 weeks each so before you know your closer to your degree and not years
Freshman,4,Easy to enroll. I had a very helpful guidance counselor that was always able to answer any questions I had and if she did not have the answer she would get back to me in less than 48 hours. Classes are all fast paced so only a month long a class. Great for those working full-time.  May options for online courses.
Niche User,4,I'd love to see the financial aid office be more accessible. The faculty are very accessible and have real world experience.
Senior,4,"I am taking classes online and I am still able to keep up. I started taking classes on campus and was nervous about online classes, but it was an easy transition. For the most part, I am able to get in touch with professors and administration, in a timely fashion. Out of the countless professors I've had classes with, only two were a little non-student oriented. But overall, I'd say this university is a good one."
Junior,4,"Most of the professors at National are great and very understanding, they do not let you fall behind and instructions are very clear. Most communicate very well and are organized. I have come across a professor that assumes everything, does not communicate, does not use black board, missed class for 2 weeks and we had to get another professor to take over. That was my only negative impression as a new student  with national. However, if you do your research and make some friends from class, your journey should be smooth."
Graduate Student,4,"National is a great place to get an education when you don't have the time to physically go to class- I am married, fully employed, with one baby and another on the way.  My master's program is properly paced and gives me a good life-balance.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because sometimes the professors seem a little 'frazzled' or the calendar gets changed frequently."
Junior,4,"National University offers accelerated classes I was able to earn my bachelors in under two years. I had a somewhat good experience, some teachers were awesome some lacked."
Junior,4,"I love the four week class schedule, it is a bit more work; however, it makes classes much more fun and I am able to concentrate and keep motivated for the whole class!!"
Sophomore,4,I am almost complete with my 2 years of prerequisites for Nursing School. So far my classes have all been appropriate in difficulty and the length of my classes have made it possible to complete my degree in a timely manner. There have been some difficulties with the financial aid office but that is expected at every college. I look forward to completing my Bachelor's and Master's Degree with National University.
Sophomore,4,"National University has been overall a good experience. The staff is very friendly and the teachers take their time to make sure you understand the material. The different campuses are well taken care of and are all over San Diego. Although, each class is only a month or two long, the fast pace setting really works for a lot of people's busy schedules and life outside of school."
Freshman,4,I love national universiry the only thing i was not happy about eas the lack of information and help the funacial aide deperrment provided me with apon enrollment.
Sophomore,4,"great place to study especially for an active duty military member. It gives the member a great advantage because you can access the classes through any computer, therefore taking online courses instead of having to be in the classroom."
Senior,4,"I have been attending National University for 7 months now. I love the structure, (one class at a time, each class lasting a month long). This allows me to focus all my energy on one set of deadlines at a time while staying balanced in my personal and work life. Some of the professors are better than others, but this is true at any university. Highly recommend."
Senior,4,"I enjoyed the campus, helpful staff and was very nice. Eager to help with enrollment and classes. Guide you with good information to complete you studies."
Junior,4,"Most people see that you're enrolled in a private school and the first thing they think of is the cost, and why even bother paying that much for your education. At National University, I have never felt more comfortable with my decision to attend a private school. I've had some the best professors that have a genuine love for their job, and really care about their students. There are multiple resources available for almost any kind of issue. And hey, free parking and free printing. Worth every penny."
Freshman,4,"The caring staff, the fantastic climate, location, shops, tourists attraction. The architecture, modernized university setting, the student to teacher ratio, the convenience of be able to focus on one class at a time."
Junior,4,I love National University! Getting your degree is fast because each class is only 4 weeks long. So far I don't have anything to complain about. 
Junior,4,NATIONAL UNIVERSITY IS A GREAT ONLINE COLLEGE FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS ECELERATED COURSES. I HAVE JUST STARTED HERE AT NATIONAL AND I REALLY LOVE IT. THE INSTRUCTIOR I HAVE ONLINE IS NICE AND IS ALWAYS WANTING TO HELP IF NEEDED. YES SCHOOL IS TOUGH AND I KNOW THIS.  I AM A SINGLE MOTHER WITH A JOB AND IS STILL DOING IT. I HAVEN'T BEEN IN SCHOOL FOR ABOUT 7 YEARS AND FINALLY DECIDED THAT IT WAS NEEDED FOR MY CARRER IN NURSING. I THINK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY WOULD BE PERFECT FOR ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL . 
College Junior,4,i have not taken any online class through this institution
College Junior,4,They are always looking for ways to improve the career cneter
College Junior,4,classes are not continous.  your completion date can be exageratedly extended If you miss a month of enrollement due to classes only available as program schedule
College Junior,4,great workshops offered to assist students from transitioning from college to new career. f
College Junior,4,Professor's have lots of great experience that they share.
College Junior,4,Classes are fast paced but thorough.  As long as you have strong will to push forward and work hard; a degree is within reach!
College Senior,4,My experience here has been good due to the fact they have classes held on base and online which makes it very convenient for military people. Most of my credits transferred over which was great.
College Senior,4,I used to hate online classes because I did not know how to manage my time. With these online classes you have to physically and mentally prepare yourself because they are fast paced. I actually enjoyed taking classes here though because the professors interact with the students. I know I missed logging on for about 3 days and my professors was emailing me checking up on me. It was a good feeling to see them not just letting me just slip behind and not caring. This is a great school with great professors teaching.
College Senior,4,The professors go right off of their syllabus which I like. There is no guessing especially with the fast pace that we are already working with. The class sizes doesn't really affect you if you are taking an online class. The professors seems to get all the assignments graded and returned back in a timely manner. The way they interact online with the students though is great. It's almost like being in class except you can't see anyone.
College Senior,4,It's great because it is exactly what I/m working towards in the real world once I graduate.
College Senior,4,This school is great for anyone looking to get in school quickly and start working right away towards their degree. I must say though that you'll have to plan everything out because it is very fast paced. It's a lot to learned in short bursts but if you're determined it'll all be worth it in the end.
College Freshman,4,I am currently taking my second course here so I cannot really answer this question.
College Freshman,4,So far my experience at this school has been great. I am currently taking my second online has and it is going well. What makes this school unique is that it is fast paced and the classes last 4 weeks. So In a year I get a span of about 12 courses completed.
College Senior,4,I had no problem when I enrolled. Everything that I was told about my transfer credits happened.
College Senior,4,"Most professors are great, but you have your occasional few that make the month seem like it is dragging on. The course work is demanding at times but as long as you put in the time and manage it you will succeed. The professors in my program are very help full and inform students of intern opportunities if they know of any that are available."
College Senior,4,"Over good school. If you are looking to get a degree and do not have the time to attend a regular school, this is the place to go. It is more expensive to attend National University but it worth it."
Junior,2,The 1 class per months pace makes retaining what you've learned a little tough. It's very flexible and easy to get classes done while working.
Graduate Student,2,"I have not had a great experience at National. A lot of students like the online program and that is what drew me to this program as well. For that matter, it is excellent; however, since there have been new hires and a lot of the old employees left the school does not run as efficiently as it used to. I am not receiving as much support as should be provided. When asking simple questions I would get sent into a loop of other answers and in the end, would be confused, and still wouldn't have an answer to my question."
Graduate Student,2,National University increased tuition within 3 months of me enrolling. It is very expensive and does not offer many perks to compensate.
College Senior,2,"This year, National University changed to a new automated information system and my school year (began July 2014) financial aid was not received until March 2015."
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid office won't help a bit. They should orient studenta not just tell you if you'll have the money or not.
College Sophomore,2,My advisor it's absent. Hard reach by phone amd takes long to reply for urgent e-mails.
College Sophomore,2,We do not have any
College Sophomore,2,Everyone pretty much already is an LVN or have more college background than I do and I feel dumb at times.
College Sophomore,2,I don't think we have any.
College Sophomore,2,I don't think this is offered.
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid does not help students at all! I have been trying to get assistance for loans and grants and they keep giving me tedious answers!
College Junior,2,I was unable to apply for the school's scholarships which I qualified for because of time limits set on them that I was not told about. This is unfair to deserving students. Financial aid should meet with prospective students to let them know what they should do in this area before beginning classes.
College Junior,2,"The courses were easy and the information minimal. I did not attend the school for the online courses. Some of the tests were poorly designed, did not test content presented in class or the text, and brought my grades down. In this school classroom participation is far superior to the online classes."
College Junior,2,"I have had to petition a few classes that I felt should have transferred with no questions asked. I often feel that co requisite classes are required only for financial profit for the institution, which is disheartening for a student."
College Sophomore,2,"Since National University is a private school, it doesn't yet have social student centers or an athletics department. To be honest, it doesn't really make a difference to me. However, I do think it would be nice to have a campus library."
College Sophomore,2,"Classes are expensive, though it's fast paced and you get into the class fast. But my A&P teacher is rather boring and almost like they're forced to be their making the class even more challenging as it brings a bad feel to the class, sucking the interest and fun out of learning."
College Freshman,2,They lost my trans scripts which put everything behind.
College Freshman,2,The facility was super slow on getting back to me when I sent emails and please be careful cause my trans scripts got lost the first time I handed them to my adviser. I had a not so good experience with them so far
College Sophomore,2,Besides having a decent library it would be nice to have an athletic center or other campus activities available. 
College Senior,2,"I am at a satellite campus and cannot speak for the main campus.  However, the library is at the main campus and is large and comfortable with several meeting and media rooms available for reservation.  Journal articles not already available can be quickly retrieved and purchased by the librarian (no direct cost to the student) for email or hard copy delivery.  The satellite campus has a computer lab and student lounge."
Alum,1,"1) 1 class=4.5 units=~$1700; if you already have a degree you do NOT qualify for any grants/scholarships
2) The counselors are a mess, no clear, concise communication.  I needed a few classes to get my cert, they said apply for CLS BS.  I said only if my classes transfer.  It took months to evaluate my transcripts and they would not accept my classes, ex: I took 10 semester units of Physics that included actual physical labs but they said I would have to take their class or file a formal petition.  There is no way their online 4 week class could possibly compare to 10 semester units (1 full year) of physics with labs I took, they just want your money.  The counselor then told me that I would have to enroll as a non-degree seeking student to take the classes I wanted.
3) After completing the classes, I asked about their master's program and was told I needed to withdraw from the CLS BS program.  Needless to say, I will not be getting my Masters here."
Sophomore,1,"I have been attending NU about two years, are they only care about separating you from your hard earned GI bill education benefits, their degrees are not worth the ink they are printed on. If you value your education benefits stay as far away as possible from national university, please heed my warning."
Sophomore,1,"they only care about separating you from your hard earn education benefits dollars, the school is a scam. If you value your money stay as far away from them as possible"
Graduate Student,1,Horribly unprofessional professors. Workloads are either nonexistent or undoable and nauseating. The expectations as listed on Blackboard Learn are never consistent an discrepancies cause unfair grading deductions. Current prof is beyond demeaning and condescending. One of my classmates left the program citing the lack of professionalism from 90% of our profs. Two profs actually gave 0 feedback of ANY kind and didn't respond to questions or participate in the class in ANY way. Surreal!! Absolutely surreal. RUN DONT WALK.
Junior,1,Enrollment and Financial Aid advisors have no idea what they are talking about. Requirements switch from person to person. Have had to pay 8k out of pocket because of being mislead and fed false information. Management higher up refuses to help.
Graduate Student,1,"I have taken five master's level courses at NU in the Engineering Management program. The program I was originally accepted into was discontinued due to low-enrollment, then the new program that was supposed to be offered entirely online was changed to a hybrid format. Only 2 of my classes actually taught me anything. The program is not designed to teach; it is designed to get you through as fast as possible and give you the piece of paper you are looking for. If you want a real education, NU is not for you. Another problem I had was that in the course of five months with NU, I had FOUR different advisors. They were always difficult to get ahold of, and whenever we finally did talk I felt like they were trying to hurry and get me off of the phone. Also, make sure before selecting your university to check accreditation. I was on the project manager track with my program, and it's not accredited by GAC. Please do your research!!"
College Sophomore,1,I dont think we have this.
College Freshman,1,So far I haven't heard anything about career services
College Junior,1,There are none that I know of.
College Senior,1,"Not sure there is a career center, however I believe there is an alumni network."
College Senior,1,We don't have a career center
College Junior,1,"Subpar teachers, late in posting grades, unqualified clinical instructors."
College Junior,1,For a private university with a very high tuition it is a poor place to get an education. The teaching staff is unimpressive and scheduling/administration staff is inconsistent. I wouldn't recommend anyone attend this university.
Recent Alumnus,1,Too expensive! You have to take loans or have a rich uncle
Recent Alumnus,1,They cost me more than they were worth. I didn't like them at all. I preferred the in-class experience.

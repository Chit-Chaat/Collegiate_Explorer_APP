Graduate Student,5,"IÂ´m a Grad student going for a MA, my teachers, and the department is always checking-in with me. During online courses, teachers are available and understanding when there is a problem with technology. 
The information and the class keep their quality. 
However, there are the difficult time they always show support to us."
Junior,5,I love the party scene and the surrounding area. Beautiful campus with lots to do everyday. You will definitley feel at home in Athens!
Junior,5,Ohio University is located in a beautiful area. Most of the faculty is very outgoing and responsive. I have enjoyed the sense of community here and am receiving a quality education.
Senior,5,The online experience has been a breeze showing up to classes virtual is just like in person. It has been an easy adjustment to the new way class has been but in my opinion its better because you have more free time and flexibility between classes. Plus the professors are more lenient now since we are in a pandemic.
Senior,5,"Ohio University has an excellent education, I would definitely recommend to a friend best school by far."
Alum,5,"Ohio University was a great undergraduate experience. I attended the Scripps College of Visual Communication, whose reputation is high in terms of their industry. I feel that I had an outstanding education overall in my major courses with reputable and experienced professors. I had many networking and involvement opportunities and the atmosphere of the school, campus, and Athens, Ohio is one I will always long for."
Alum,5,I took a few classes online during the years my major courses required outside projects. It allowed for me to complete courses on my own time and focus my time on major projects without having as many scheduling obstacles. I liked that I was able to pursue it as an option to better dedicate my time to my studies.
Freshman,5,The campus at OU is very beautiful! Everyone is so welcoming and the advisors keep you on s great scheldue! Great university
Junior,5,Online learning experience is great! The professors make it very easy to adjust to the online learning environment!
Junior,5,"Affordable, campus life is great! Very easy to get around, everything is within walking distance. Beautiful all year round"
Junior,5,"It is hard to spend your life in Athens, OH and not fall in love with it. The campus is beautiful, the people are friendly, and no one feels like an outcast. You will not regret your decision to attend."
Sophomore,5,Loved the people I met and all the different experiences I got to enjoy while on campus. Ping was my favorite place to go.
Sophomore,5,"Ohio University has became my second home. With great professors that want you to succeed, to free tutoring for your troubling and stressful times. Waling distance to coffee shops, hang outs, fresh produce and entertainment. Cost of living is cheap, and you're guaranteed to have a memorable time. OU OH YEAH"
Sophomore,5,"Online courses are hard, but the professors and advisors I have had during the COVID-19 pandemic have been nothing short of amazing! They stay in touch as often as possible, and want you to succeed."
Junior,5,Ohio University is a beautiful campus. Everyone always has a smile on their face and is willing to give a helping hand. All the teaches and staff are also on your side. OU is my second home and I am beyond glad I decided to attend this campus.
Graduate Student,5,"Ohio University provides a sound environment that allows transformation of students from diverse backgrounds to receive knowledge and demonstrate its practicality, from more than 250 different programs that are being offered.
  This institution offers a flexible  learning schedule that is convenient for students  to study. The teachers are patient and care that the students grasp the meaning and understand what their learning, so that they can come out with the results they want. I believe they have a perfect system and would like to encourage them to keep up the good work!"
Graduate Student,5,I have had a  great online class. Yes most of my classes were online and the professors showed keen interest in making sure we all had a secure connection so that we would  not miss out on any lectures. Access to online lectures recorded where made available so that  students could listen to the  lectures as a way of reviewing them .
Alum,5,only had a few online classes but they were sufficient and the professors were helpful. The school tends to push students to take inclass classes which I agree with.
Alum,5,"OU gave me one of the best experiences I could have ever imagined. greek life is a big thing at OU, however, I didn't join a frat and my freshman roommates were my best friends. Halloween brings tons of people into town and is a big event as well as fest season in the spring. The bars uptown vary in style and can give you a nice variety as far as crowds are concerned. going out on the weekend you will see the streets lined with people and bars packed with people just having a good time. The college of business was great as well and I really enjoyed the various group projects I had the pleasure of working on. There are plenty of clubs available as well for any interests you may have which provide additional opportunities to meet friends or to continue doing things you may enjoy. OU is definitely unlike any other place and I wouldn't trade my time there for the world."
Freshman,5,Everyone is welcoming and friendly. The staff is always available and happy to help. They're incredible at preparing you for the transition from high school to college.
Junior,5,"teachers online are still very helpful, respond quickly, and are understanding. The classes are nicely structured and easy to navigate."
Junior,5,All faculty want to help you and do everything they can. Classes are challenging but there's always resources to succeed!
Freshman,5,Ohio university is very accepting. They are always willing to work with you and get you off into a job
Sophomore,5,Ohio University is a fantastic institution with an outstanding social system implemented into the campus and beautiful parts of nature surrounding it.  The campus overall is a large social bubble everyone is friendly and nobody seems to be left out. The scenery of Athens is amazing all of the hills and hocking hills not too far away makes you want to go out and walk and be physically active every day.
Sophomore,5,The online learning experience was an easy transition because the campus already had a system set up for this kind of occasion.  The learning was relatively the same as in-person learning except a few assignments were changed because of the tools needed were on campus.
Freshman,5,"The staff and educators are very friendly and want to see you succeed. The campus is beautiful and has a small town feel. The local restaurants are all amazing and the both the customers and workers in them are even better. The dorms aren't anything spectacular, but they definitely aren't anything bad. I feel like I am getting a good education for my money."
Freshman,5,"With COVID-19, the professors all had to move classes online, and given the stress and time crunch of the transition, the professor did a great job and were still able to make the change and make the most of the situation."
Sophomore,5,OU has a big school feel without being too large and intimidating.  The campus is beautiful and everyone treats you like family.  Athens is small but I felt like there was plenty of things to do on campus and nearby.  There are plenty of clubs and organizations that you can join.
Alum,5,Did all my classes online. Struggled a little with the first class but that was my own doing because I did not understand APA format. I did have an instructor my very last class who was not fond of my writing but I still did what was needed. She sent me to the student success center and everything they had me fix she marked off for. My accutal writing professor that semester had no complaints about my writing. Writing is subjective so it is what it is. Still accomplished my goal.
Alum,5,I was able to finish my degree while working at the same time. I also didn't have to attend classes on a campus and could take things at my pace.
Senior,5,I like the small community that the campus brings to the table. The professors are very intelligent and concerned with student learning.
Alum,5,Amazing experience. Lots of degree opportunities. Friendly environment. Ohio University provides a true college experience.
Sophomore,5,"Ohio University has been nothing but amazing to me. I have connected with staff members, advisors, and students. It is a place to feel welcomed and involved. The campus also is very inviting and even after a bad day, walking around can instantly make you feel better. I would recommend Ohio University to everyone."
Sophomore,5,"Ohio University is a place you can definitely call home. When you first get there it can be intimidating but after a month or so of being there you'll find some people to hang out with. The campus is full of very nice people so there's no need to be afraid of someone. The food at OU is pretty decent, but there will be times when you don't want dining hall food. When that time comes around you can go off campus to different eateries like Chipotle, Wendy's, Big Momma's Burritos, Chinese food, Indian food, there's countless options."
Niche User,5,"I am a transfer study looking to use this scholarship in my future at Ohio University. I have visited the campus many time and it has been my dream school for as long as I can remember. While I am now graduating from Cuyahoga Community College in good standing this is the perfect time for me to make my Ohio University dreams come true. The campus is welcoming, clean, experienced and makes me feel at home. I have not yet been able to confirm my enrollment there as I need means to pay for the school before I can commit to going there. I believe I am deserving of this scholarship because I am dedicated to my commitment to the school and the impact I will have on the OU community. With the coronavirus going on I am not going to be able to visit the school again before I have to make my decision, so I am reliant on my ability to get scholarships to help me through this time."
Sophomore,5,I love that Ohio university feels like my home city . It also is very welcoming and allows diversity and many options to get involved with clubs and other things. This school HAs a program where you can make your own major that fits best to you. What I would change is them making it easier to get the help you need like a tutor for a difficult class. It's hard sometimes to figure out the resources that you have to use. Especially when you come in as a freshman other than that though. I love the school and in two years will become an alumni.
Graduate Student,5,"So far the experience has been good.  I am an online student, so I have no opinions or experience on-campus.  The professors have been helpful and knowledgeable.  The course work has been challenging and rewarding."
Freshman,5,"I love almost everything about Ohio University. My favorite thing about campus is how much every student helps and cares for one another. However, one aspect I would like to see change is for the tuition to be lowered. I am only a college freshman and over ten-thousand dollars in debt to attend school here."
Alum,5,Amazing experience. I'm from Brazil and everybody (teachers and studants)were so kind. I learned a lot.
Junior,5,This University provides ample amount of support to its students and really cares about them succeeding.
Sophomore,5,I love Ohio University! This school is so exciting and is full of diversity and beauty. Athens is a wonderful place to live and letâs you live in a small town environment. The only thing OHIO University should work on is how they were handling budget cuts with their employees and laying them off. It isnât right when the coaches are being paid more than the instructors and our president; there needs to be a change.
Freshman,5,"Great university. The campus really lets you grow into your own person and mature as an adult. None of the class buildings are too far away, and the dorm food is good. Easy to meet new people in the local Athens town."
Junior,5,"OU is more than I ever needed in a college. We truly balance partying and schoolwork. The ETM program is so great. My professors care so much about my success. The friends Iâve met here have become lifelong best friends. The campus is beautiful, and Athens is THE college town, it doesnât get much better. Court Street on a Saturday is really something to see. The surrounding area has its problems, but the university offers so many ways to give back. I think about how different my life would be if I had decided to go to the other colleges I applied to. I wouldnât have it any other way. Athens, OH will always be a part of my life. Itâs hOUme."
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed OU very much, the food was absolutely amazing along with the facilities there. The dorms were nice and the people were even better. I cannot wait to begin my semester there to work towards my degree that I want to get, I cant wait to start college track also I hope to go to places I've been dreaming of going to ever since I was little."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely am in love with OHio University. At first, as a freshman, college was scary and overwhelming, but OU put me in a learning community so I met the people in my classes and made so many friends through it. The campus is nothing short of amazing, the factuality is outstanding, and the energy at Ohio University is definitely rare. I feel so comfortable and safe here in Athens and I recommend OU first to anyone looking at colleges in Ohio, or even colleges in general!"
Freshman,5,"Overall, my first year here at Ohio University has been exceptional! I've made new friends through my residence hall and through the clubs provided by the school. Though there was somewhat of a difficult transition in adulthood in moving here, it was very quickly remedied. Something I recommend to anyone who plans to attend Ohio University or any college, based on what I've learned in my time here, is that when the classes can be a little taxing, speak to the teachers, attend Supplemental Instruction, and work outside of class to better your understanding."
Freshman,5,I have enjoyed my experience at Ohio University thus far. The professors are very helpful and leave you well prepared for the future. There are plenty of non-academic opportunities that are also extremely helpful and inclusive.
Freshman,5,"I have enjoyed my time at Ohio University. I have grown up wanting to be a Bobcat one day, and that dream has come true. The campus is very beautiful and it's a great area. There is someone that is always there to help you through this challenging part of your life at Ohio University. They truly want the best for their students!"
Freshman,5,I love the OU atmosphere. The teachers and students alike encourage you to be who you want to be and live your best life. The school is truly inclined to help you achieve you everyday and long term goals.
Freshman,5,When I visited Ohio University I knew it would be the college I attended for many reasons including the fact that it felt like home and everyone you meet is very kind. The campus is gorgeous all year and has many cute shops and coffee shops.
Freshman,5,I am in the Mechanical Engineering Program and I am impressed with how professors will go out of there way to see you succeed. We even have our own math professors to teach calculus related to engineering. Everyone is very welcoming on campus and I've met so many people all from different walks of life. I am really happy that I chose Ohio don't regret the decision at all.
Senior,5,This has been a great experience. I have been able to complete my RN to BSN within 1year! The classes have been manageable and the professors are very involved!
Niche User,5,it is beautiful and people are always friendly!! the food is good and there are so many different options. the rec center is a good place to workout and meet new people as well as all the different cafeterias. the dorms are nice and it is an open door community which allows for you to meet new people and make friends easily!
Sophomore,5,"Great school with a beautiful atmosphere and great faculty and teachers. OU has an amazing journalism program, as well as nursing and education, among other top-notch programs."
Freshman,5,"Ohio University is truly the best place to be! I am so glad I chose to go here. When people say it's ""hOUme,"" they're not wrong. It has easily become my second home and I am so grateful for the lifelong friends I have made here in such a short period of time (I am a freshman just finishing up her first semester). Athens has my heart and I know it always will."
Freshman,5,The professors are all amazing and have their students' best interests at heart. The people are friendly and always willing to help someone
Senior,5,I'm enrolled in the online RN-BSN program while working full time and it has been really convenient. I'm able to work and complete assignments stress free.
Niche User,5,I liked Ohio university very much and was happy with what I saw there when i went.  I don't think anything should change because the school overall was excellent.
Sophomore,5,So far I would say that going here as been a great experience. The campus is very beautiful throughout the year. My core classes for computer science are usually fun and engaging. For the first time in my life i actually feel like i'm learning something.
Freshman,5,It's a very pretty campus and people are very friendly about helping you find the resources you need.
Graduate Student,4,ItÂ´s a very multicultural campus. The  teachers really care about students. Even with covid are constantly trying to connect with students even grad-students.
Sophomore,4,I love the college campus and town that surrounds the campus. I feel at home when I am there and all the faculty are very kind.
Junior,4,"Some professors have adjusted wonderfully to online, while a few have neglected their responsibilities. Overall the experience has been well."
Alum,4,"I loved OU, the campus is beautiful, and I never had an issue with any of my professors. My advisor, though, was not very good. I was my own advisor basically, and because of this, I found myself in the final semester and had to change my major because there was one more class I needed and it was not offered. So I had to change my major and take two extra classes... But  I did graduate a year early like I had planned."
Senior,4,The online part of the school has been great. The financial aid office needs work to help improve it.
Senior,4,The online classes are well done. Blackboard is easy to use. Most instructors have been great to work with. My advisor has been very helpful.
Freshman,4,My experience so far has been amazing and I'm looking forward to getting back on campus. Can't wait!
Freshman,4,Will be starting online in a few weeks. Curious to see how it goes but my professors seem great. I'm excited to start my new classes.
Alum,4,The business school is okay. The accounting program isnât the best but the education is fairly good especially with the IT aspect. They do a great job enforcing the need to get a job which makes finding employment super easy compared to other schools.
Alum,4,"OU is a great middle of the run school. Partying has died down ever single year Iâve been there and they are trying really hard to get away from the party reputation (which makes the school worse imo). I graduated this spring and there is no way Iâd recommend an incoming freshman to go there especially during COVID. They need to work on spending money and lowering tuition. But Athens, Ohio is a beautiful and amazing place to go to school."
Sophomore,4,So far the environment has been very welcoming with lots of opportunity to get involved in the community!
Sophomore,4,It was a lot easier than my in class experience. I did a lot better on the assignments and kept up with the school work.
Junior,4,During the pandemic all classes were moved online for safety and I was pleasantly surprised with how well the transition went. Most professors were very understanding with how much our lives were changing because we had to move out and find jobs while still trying to take classes. The university itself offered different resources for people who were having trouble transitioning or trouble with mental issues that may have come from being relocated.
Junior,4,Ohio University is a very diverse place and they have very good staff. What Ohio University needs to do is keep their staff instead of laying off people.
Sophomore,4,Almost all of my online professors have been very great and understanding. Of course not everything is perfect and you have your occasional strict professor online who does not accept technical difficulties.
Sophomore,4,"A very fun, beautiful, and accepting campus. Everyone can find their own group at OU! Personally, Ohio University was not my first choice, but due to the cost I had no other option.  I have made many lifelong friends in just my first year. Although, what seemed to be an issue at first, turned into one of the greatest decisions I have made."
Junior,4,"I overall experience for  Ohio University is good so far. What I like to see change? When I am signing up for classes, there is less options for me to choose for my major. I like to see more online classes for regional campus as well as having more on campus classes for the regional campus."
Junior,4,"I am currently a Junior and enrolled in Ohio University. The experience I have so far at Ohio University is good. I take both online and on campus classes, the online classes are easy to complete work, and a lot more convenient for me."
Sophomore,4,"I didn't choose to take online courses. However, with COVID 19 I had to finish out the remainder of the year remotely/online.  It was a different way of learning and sometimes a little more challenging than being in the classroom."
Sophomore,4,Mostly really good. Only really struggled in one class because of formatting issues with the lessons and tests.
Sophomore,4,"Ohio University is, so far, a solid institution. I have had good success in my classes and the staff is resourceful."
Freshman,4,Ohio University is a great school. The atmosphere promotes growth and independence. Making friends is easy because on OU campus everyone is family! The classes are incredible as well as the professors who are always there to help student do well in their classes.
Freshman,4,"The campus is absolutely gorgeous and the community at Ohio University is so amazing. When you attend Ohio University, you become apart of a family."
Senior,4,"OU has the most amazing campus and community. Athens is like no place on Earth but, I am very disappointed in the recent faculty cuts and general response to a budget crisis."
Junior,4,"Ohio University is a hidden gem in the midwest. I love the school itself, the educational faculty, and the students. Where Ohio University falls short is in its administration. The budget cuts are tearing this amazing place apart."
Sophomore,4,Great environment. Everyone id friendly and willing to help. Don't be scared to go out and try new things. There are plenty of options in Athens Ohio.
Alum,4,"I attended the journalism school and had a great experience, but it's definitely what you make of it. I sought out advice from professors and my advisor, applied to a national internship program, and completed a work study program where I held various writing internships around the campus. It's really important to take advantage of these types of activities. I felt like I got a really great education here, the professors are top notch, and the campus is beautiful with plenty of ways to get involved and have fun outside of class."
Sophomore,4,I have been applying as a transfer student during this Covid-19 pandemic and theyâve been very responsive and helpful to all of my needs and concerns!
Freshman,4,The professors are very down to earth. I am in the Child and Family Studies Major and my classes are pretty specific.
Senior,4,There's a really fun campus atmosphere and really supportive advisors to push you through the four years to graduate. The professors can be hit or miss but that tends to be how it is with most colleges. There's a strong party culture and if you enjoy that you'll love OU.
Freshman,4,Ohio has been very welcoming and supportive! There are many ways to get involved and I feel at home.
Niche User,4,I enjoyed Ohio university when I visited. The campus was really pretty and clean. There was a lot of detail on the campus that made it a good place to live. There was a lot going on in and around campus. It is a good school.
Works Here,4,I love Ohio University due to the always expanding amount and variety of people. There's always someone new to meet and new things to learn about other communities that can be potentially important to your education and your outlook on other types of people.
Freshman,4,Some of the courses and majors can be difficult to get into and often times professors and advisers will have contradicting information. But once you learn to navigate all of that it's a nice college town with a lot of opportunities.
Niche User,4,"Ohio University has a truly beautiful campus. There are little campus's just like it. Although academics is one of the top priorities, there is so many fun things to do. The coffee shops around campus are delicious and the food is on the better side of university food."
Senior,4,"My Integrated Media major and media program is exceptional in value and educational experiences. Scripps College of Communication is nationally ranked for exceptional curriculum as well as resources to media equipment and access to life-changing internships, master classes and study abroad opportunities."
Freshman,4,"Ohio University is an amazing campus. The brick roads and buildings make the place seem as if you are right at home. Not only is it a beautiful place to live, but you get an amazing education. All of the dorms could use a renovation, but besides that, everyone here is very friendly and welcoming."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a student in the College of Business at Ohio University. Honestly, the educational experience here has far exceeded my expectations. From the first day of classes I fell in love with the curriculum and felt inspired to grow. The staff has been nothing but amazing, and I feel like I am learning valuable information for the first time in my life. Also, the people here are fantastic. The bobcat community is like a big family, and welcomes anyone and everyone with open arms."
Sophomore,4,"The university is very aesthetically pleasing to look at and has a wide variety of clubs to join. However, parking spaces are limited and on-campus jobs are hard to attain at times."
Junior,4,The school was the perfect size for me. Not too big or too small. Just about every teacher I have had has made theyâre best effort in making sure their students are being successful in their everyday lives.
Freshman,4,I really admire the education provided by the professors in Athens and how much they care for students. I also really enjoy the campus
Freshman,4,"The thing I love most about Ohio University is the overall environment. The people are always so welcoming, fun, and unique. Besides the community aspect, the classes offered are extremely beneficial to one's education. You learn quickly that you get what you give and there is A LOT to give. There are many opportunities for both academic and social success."
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful and everyone there is super friendly and willing to help lost visitors or students.
Freshman,4,"Ohio University is a great college to go too. The people are nice, there are a lot of opportunities for you to get involved, and it's super pretty. The only downfall with OU is the fact that there is not much to do because it's in a small town and the campus is super hilly. Jeff hill and Morton hill will be the death of you."
Sophomore,4,Small class size and good professors. Lots of student activities and associations. Dining halls in convenient locations. Clean and safe campus.
Junior,4,"Ohio University is a beautiful school with lots of options for education. For me, it's media program is good, offering many courses in several different areas. They also have numerous clubs that can help you with your career."
Junior,4,I love the intimate class style and the amount of help every professor here wants to give you. The campus is beautiful and the local towns people are very nice and gracious. Feels like home!
Senior,4,I had a great experience at OHIO. There are a lot of organizations to join. I enjoyed the numerous academic help when needed. Overall great experience.
Freshman,4,"Overall, my experience with Ohio University has been great. The honors and scholars programs in particular are above average and have proven to be very helpful to me as a student. The campus is beautiful and very welcoming. The squirrels are not very welcoming but they are entertaining to watch from a distance. The environment here in Athens is pretty relaxed for the most part and most people tend to be very open minded and accepting. Although the hills look intimidating, getting to classes on time is rarely an issue with proper planning."
Niche User,4,"Beautiful campus and facilities. Located in a nice area, student atmosphere is full of life. I have not met any faculty members but i'm sure they are very friendly as well."
Freshman,4,Good school. Decent professors. Nice environment and weather. Most things are within walking distance
Freshman,4,I like the professors and staff at OU. The campus is beautiful and has gorgeous scenery. There's always deer walking around and roaming the campus.
Sophomore,4,"Its a relatively small college campus. The professors are mostly nice but there are some that have no idea what they are doing. Other than that, its pretty good."
Junior,4,"Ohio University is a big school but feels like a small town. There are plenty of opportunities made available in and out of the classroom. Super easy to party, Court Street is one of the best college bar streets in the country. The business school provides great networking opportunities and career development. Most students who go here are from Ohio."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a student at Ohio University and besides the beautiful community that surrounds the campus, the academics and student-life here is outstanding!"
Freshman,4,"ohio university is not only beautiful, but close knit. All the faculty I have encountered are kind and receptive. They all want to see you succeed. however, the hills here are killer and you can feel a little isolated as there is not much off campus."
Sophomore,4,"I love going to school at OHIO! The school definitely lacks in diversity, but I'm in an honors program that really challenges me and helps me build great connections. The professors care about the students and the school is right in the middle of great downtown Athens."
Freshman,4,"So far, as an incoming freshman, Ohio University has been great. They relay all the important information as quickly as possible and are also available for any questions. The other students are super nice and always try their best to accommodate you on tours or during Orientation."
Freshman,4,It is a nice campus in a nice city. It has a good student to staff ratio and an encouraging environment.
Sophomore,4,Ohio University has a very welcoming atmosphere and welcomed me with open arms. My professors helped me through any material I didn't understand and they were willing to take outside of class time to help me if I needed it as well.
Sophomore,2,I felt like some professors assigned more work because they are online classes without regard for our other classes or other campus involvement
Sophomore,2,"As an incoming sophomore I'll let you know right now, the University has some MAJOR financial priority issues. We're currently in a financial crisis although they'll hide that the best they can from prospective students. Overall, I'm learning, but I definitely wouldn't recommend OU as a first choice right now. The campus can be fun, but not on any part of the university. Students truly are the entire light of this school. Partying has died down and fests are being cancelled often so if thats what you're looking for you might be a couple years too late. I like OU. A lot. It's close to home and I feel like I'm getting decent education (the cost makes me physically ill to think about though). I just wish the administration would pull their heads out of their butts and genuinely support staff and students."
Sophomore,2,"When selecting a college to attended to, I focused on how a school handled sexual assault, mental illness, and overall academics. When solely focusing on academics, OU would earn five stars. Sadly, I cannot say that for the other two. The summer of 2018 I was raped, and I have struggled with depression since my teen years. As a result, I was flustered when I arrived at OU months after my assault. The admission counselors bragged about their mental health programs. I did not have good experiences with them. It was as if what happened was my fault. When i began to struggle with my thoughts, I went to an adviser, and i was told to drop classes. Because of this advice, I no longer qualify for aide."
Freshman,2,I would like to see more diversity in campus and also more activities to do for the black community. The campus isnât unified at all and itâs very upsetting.
College Freshman,2,"If you're not willing to drink. smoke, and party you are often left out of all the fun. It becomes extremely hard to meet people and make friends if you don't want to take part in those activities. Underage drinking is very common, and extremely easy."
College Sophomore,2,"My tumultuous first year on the campus has led me to conclude that sexual assault is an issue that needs to be taken more seriously on this campus, as well as every campus in the country. Ohio University was in an odd place concerning sexual assault due to the closing of the Ohio University Survivor Advocacy Program, which provided confidential services to victims of sexual assault. The only confidential service offered on campus was the Counseling and Psychological Services, and it was already overbooked throughout the year. Not only should more preventative steps be taken on this campus concerning sexual assault, but more services should be offered to those who are survivors of sexual assault."
College Sophomore,2,I do not really care for greek life so this does not interest me either.
College Sophomore,2,if you don't live in the new builds or newly remodeled it can suck to live in the dorms. the room selection process sucks and is not efficient nor fair to all!!!!!!!
College Junior,2,greek life is so-so here at my school
College Senior,2,No intern opportunities around campus.  There is a decent job recruitment process that is not at full capacity.
College Senior,2,The sports teams here are hard to watch.
College Freshman,2,So far I've had mostly physics and math classes and no one in those departments know what they are doing from my experience so it's hard to speak for anything more than that.
College Freshman,2,Too much money from tuition goes towards paying for sports when the teams aren't very good.
College Sophomore,2,"The way you get to choose your housing as a returning student is awful, and a lot of the buildings are old and kind of gross which the majority of them are."
College Freshman,2,I personally just am not interested in Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"Campus Care is pretty lame. It's expensive. Plus, they misdiagnosed me with ""allergies""... later (at the hospital) I was diagnosed with pneumonia!"
College Freshman,2,"We work hard 5 days a week, but we are definitely a party school. Alcohol is simple to get. It's at every party. Many bars don't ID, or don't start until very late in the evening. Several stores don't ID, too. Beer and cheap vodka are the easiest to find. It's a little harder to find wine, whiskey, and other liquor, but they're still out there.

There's a fair bit of pot around, too. During exams week, Adderall is everywhere. I've never seen or heard of any other drugs save for one friend of mine who saw a dude do a line of cocaine at a party.

The redeeming things are that they aren't too hard on offenders, and that if you don't want to drink/smoke/take something, no one is going to push you to do so."
College Freshman,2,I feel that the greet life at Ohio University needs to pay more attention to the Greek life because some sororities and fraternities are known for doing things that are not helping the university but hurting it's reputation.
College Sophomore,2,There are job/internship/research opportunities but they seem to only be geared to students in the honors tutorial college.
College Freshman,2,Not that great. out of state and need a lot of financial aid
College Freshman,2,The prices of the housing off campus is ridiculous. I feel like they forget that everyone is trying to pay for college at the same time so why make the housing price through the roof?!
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive much aid, most of it's from loans."
College Freshman,2,There are very few healthy options. I would be terrified to see the nutrition facts on any of the food on Court Street.
College Freshman,2,I never got to speak with a financial advisor and I was unaware that I had to accept my student loan until October/ November when they'd already charged me for being late.
College Sophomore,2,"The school should put more money aside for scholarships, not enough are given out."
College Freshman,2,"It's easy to get into, lots of party opportunities, but all you do is spend your time with the frat and never go to class. Your life will soon turn into one of continuous binge drinking (every night of the week) and smoking pot till you can't move. If you're not in a frat, then you are looked down upon and there's typically nothing to do.....ever"
College Freshman,2,"The party's are NUTS!!! Any wild college fantasy you can think of or you've ever had, can happen on any given night. What sucks is partying is the only thing anyone ever talks about, and the only thing anyone does. If you're not too into partying, drinking all the time and smoking pot on a religious basis, OHIO U IS NOT FOR YOU!!!!"
College Freshman,2,"The rooms are typical, but unless you want to drink all the time or smoke weed all the time, good luck"
College Freshman,2,The dorms are run down and needs renovated. Not many showers either. cleanliness is an issue.
College Junior,2,"It is extremely hard to gain financial aid. I don't think that they truly take into consideration a students circumstances. Not just parents income, but they need to think about number of siblings, a students activities, service work, job, and their overall drive and work ethic."
College Freshman,2,Where is dining hall food ever going to be good?
College Freshman,2,Nobody really cares about the sports here. During football games you will see an abundance of people leave at halftime to go party.
College Freshman,2,The food in every dining hall doesn't sit well with me.
College Freshman,2,The scholarships are very hard to attain and even more difficult to retain.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's really not that diverse.  There are more international students on campus than African Americans.  The international students tend to stick to themselves, but I've found that if you reach out, they are very friendly and would love to have more American friends."
College Sophomore,2,Applied early but they hardly give any money for transfer students
College Junior,2,"They tend to be extremely expensive and in addition, the houses especially, tend to be in bad shape."
College Sophomore,2,The Financial aid office seemed a bit overwhelmed. Perhaps hiring more advisers will help ease the stress during all the last minute calls.
College Sophomore,2,"Trying to receive financial aid for college during our generation is very difficult and frustrating. It requires many steps, and you need to save copies of all your information. its a long, and grueling process, and you end up not even receiving the aid you honestly need in the long run."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life isn't that big on campus but lots of students are still involved.
College Sophomore,2,There is a lot of room for improvement at Ohio Universities dinning facilities. They should try a wider variety of foods and longer hours of operation.
College Freshman,2,"I fear daily about how I am going to pay for this education. My best tips to potential bobcats is DO GOOD IN HIGH SCHOOL. There are lots of scholarships Ohio University can offer if you have good grades and good ACT scores. Just try and you're bound to get some money. Also, get a JOB and SAVE UP! Another tip, if you get money for graduation, don't blow it on a new pair of shoes or something silly like that.. save it. Save all your pennies."
College Junior,2,"Campus is majority white, not too diverse"
College Junior,2,We could use more options and student discounts
College Junior,2,There's not much to do outside of campus.
College Junior,2,its hard to find off campus living because it limited and expensive.
College Sophomore,2,You are going to find drugs and alcohol on this campus. It's a known party school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Ohio does not give out very much financial aid. So while I had little problem getting my financial aid, most of it came through loans."
College Freshman,2,I was rewarded  a partial scholarship but did not apply for any other financial aide
College Freshman,2,"The city and university need to work on the parking regulations. The cost in Athens for hourly parking is average however for an annual of quarterly parking it's expensive. Also, almost everywhere in campus requires money. I wish that there was a free parking at least in campus and near classes because students cant afford paying tickets all the time."
College Freshman,2,"As an international students, there is barely any financial aid that I can be eligible for despite the fact that I have been here for all of my high school year and participated in the a lot of activities and my high GPA."
College Freshman,2,"Computer labs at Ohio University are very nice and printing is cheap and easy to do. However, the wireless access is not so great for personal computers. Sometimes it will kick you off if you are in the middle of something and are unable to recover it."
College Sophomore,2,It is way to expensive to live off campus. Everything is over priced.
College Sophomore,2,"The drug scene at OU is pretty bad. If you live on South Green ""Dirty South"" you are considered a drug user because that's where all the drug use happens. When you walk on South Green no matter what time of the day it is, you can always smell drugs and even see people doing them."
College Freshman,2,I am not a fan of the night life here at OU. It is actually a really popular thing. Underage drinking is a big problem and people rarely are punished for it. There are a lot of bars uptown and a lot if side street parties every weekend and even during the week.
College Freshman,2,"I had pretty good grades from high school coming into my freshman year and felt that I should have been given a little bit of a larger scholarship. Throughout this year I did not think much about applying for more for this upcoming school year and by the time it was brought to my attention, the deadline had passed and I was not able to apply. The advertisement/awareness for it was very poor"
College Freshman,2,"A lot of students smoke marijuana and hookah and it seen pretty often, especially at parties. I have only seen hard-care drugs once or twice but they are definitely in use here. Peer pressure is usually only bad when someone is not drinking, other than that people will offer you something, and if you don't want it, then they don't really care."
College Freshman,2,"The best and worst part of Ohio University, is the university's location. Athens, Ohio is a small town that lacks charm but in turn provides its students with an incentive for partying. There is absolutely nothing to do around the school except drink, smoke, and party. The school has earned its reputation for partying.  Congratulations.

The professors are under-qualified, and education at OU defiantly takes the backseat."
College Freshman,2,"An abundance of underage drinking. You can find used joints around campus, there is a near by hookah bar, and sometimes it reeks of weed. Underage students have fake ID's which some of them obtain when they arrive to Ohio University."
College Freshman,2,"The guys and girls here are on the upper side of the attractive scale. There are alot of good looking people here. Although 90% of them lack common sense and personality, they make up for it in looks. There is a very wide diversity in dress style. The guys usually wear athletic wear, while girls are very fashionable. Everyone on campus parties. That's all they live for."
Junior,1,You basically have to teach yourself all of the courses. Ohio wasn't ready to do online school and it shows.
Sophomore,1,"After we were kicked off campus several of my instructors gave up or were excessively harsh in their grading. Not to pull the pity card here, but I ended up homeless living in my car doing my work in a taco bell parking lot. Some instructors were great and adapted very well. Others became lazy in their teaching and/or graded seemingly harder because we ""had plenty of time on our hands"". (One in the math department who I wont name, just watch out for her, failed me even after getting passing grades ((C's, but still passing)). The transition was awful, and I'm dreading the online components of this coming semester."
Senior,1,Do not go to this school for a Flight Aviation degree.   They do not pay their flight instructors a competitive wage therefore there is a shortage of flight instructors so you will finsh up all your classes except for your flight classes (which based on weather and current instructors) will take 10+ years (unless you switch majors).
Freshman,1,"Truly the worst decision I have ever made as an out of state student. My friends and I all intend to transfer at the end of the year. The healthcare out here is non exsistent. They cap the hours you're allowed to work at 25 ( some students are paying for their own college), there are roaches and there is absolutely nothing to do in Athens Ohio but to drink. OU? Oh no."
College Sophomore,1,The people in Greek life are one thing I do not like about this campus.
College Freshman,1,"Sexual Assault on Ohio University's campus is a serious issue. The administration will begin the year with long speeches about their no tolerance policy on sexual assault when in reality their actions have facilitated the extremely high and frightening numbers of sexual assault on campus. In the past ten years there has been only one case of explosion due to sexual assault, when OU remains one of the top schools for sexual assault in both Ohio and the nation. The administration even ended a program that helped sexual assault survivors in ways the school could not. They even did this after a documentary on sexual assault was released that specifically mentioned OU. This school is very unsafe in terms of sexual assault, it facilitates rape culture, victim blames, protects the perpetrators, and gives little help to the victims."
College Freshman,1,"Campus Housing is for lack of a better term absolute garbage. The dorms are extremely over priced and poorly taken care of. Rooms without air conditioning are nearly unbearable in the early fall and late spring, and cost just as much as rooms with air. Many rooms have broken doors, desks, and huge holes in the walls. Work Orders are hardly ever fulfilled, and it is a hassle to try and get work done in your room. The bathrooms are average for being shared, however the hot water frequently is not working. Dorms are not worth half of what you're paying for them."
College Freshman,1,"Greek Life at Ohio University may seem like a great way to develop a healthy, active social life on campus. Although there are many fraternities and sororities on campus that strive to be beneficial towards the community, there are many that cause more harm than good. These are the fraternities and sororities that facilitate heavy and frequent underage drinking, support rape culture, contribute to the alarming sexual assault statistics on campus, and damage the community together. It is understood that this is college, and the students will drink even if they aren't of age, however Greek Life on campus doesn't provide a safe environment for young drinkers. I would also advise young women to avoid Greek Life sponsored parties, as they can get extremely dangerous."
College Freshman,1,It's way too overpriced for such minor and dumb rules that any apartment would allow without question.
College Freshman,1,Usually they are filled with people who don't care about school and just came to party.
College Student,1,"Ohio University is still nothing more than a party school! 

It is an EXTREMELY DANGEROUS campus.

The older dorm are a complete disgrace even for a big college.

If you have a daughter or are a girl considering attending THINK TWICE.

They try to hide the statistics but sexual related crimes here are disturbing. I personally know 2 people who have been raped this year, 1 month into class.

It is all fueled by the out of control underage drinking.

The administration is the big problem, them make big speeches but dont really care.

They dont care about the kids , they are just faceless statistics. They could solve a lot of the problems but choose to look the other away."
College Freshman,1,"There's always a group of drunk, sweaty guys trying to get my phone number or ""buy me Big Mama's"". I would rather sit in my room and watch Netflix alone than leave with one of those guys."
College Junior,1,"Awful, nearly all landlords focus on making money off students."
College Freshman,1,It's all superficial and people only care about hooking up. Nobody wants a serious relationship.
College Freshman,1,"The campus is nice...and that's about it. The staff won't do anything for you. The people are dicks. If you don't drink or smoke, no one will be your friend. Everything is insanely fake, superficial, and even your so called ""closest friends"" will stab you in the back. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!"
College Freshman,1,I didn't receive any financial aid and I'm still trying to get money for next year. It is not an easy process.
College Junior,1,I owe $8000 for the year and am having the most difficult time with help and information.
College Junior,1,"I didn't receive nearly enough, I am struggling"
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are a ton of computers for students to use on campus. The internet though, is something to be desired."
College Sophomore,1,"It's horrible to tell you the truth. We experience all four seasons every season, but we deal with it!"
College Freshman,1,"The main policy is, ""what they don't know can't hurt them"". Some of the professors are naive to their students cheating in class. The dorm officials barely ever do anything about the underage drinking or drug use in dorms."
College Freshman,1,"Way too many parties. At least two a week. The clubs let minors in with fake ID's, the parties get crazy, and mostly everyone is drunk. It's is not a very positive nightlife."
College Senior,1,Most are douchers with a capital D!!
College Senior,1,"APD is the WORST. Overaggressive, ""I carry a big stick because I was made fun of growing up"" imbeciles."
College Sophomore,1,Out of control and under enforced
College Freshman,1,"The greek women of Ohio University are very judgmental, good luck getting into a sorority unless you have lots of extra funds just sitting around. the rush process is very discouraging and turns away lots of very intelligent worthy girls. The Greek office is run by a bunch of girls who are not very professional and give out wrong information and make you feel unimportant unless you belong to a chapter."
College Sophomore,1,"I would recommend doing it very far in advance. It takes awhile, especially if you have any complications."
College Sophomore,1,"The school is not that big so transportation is not really necessary, unless you are handicapped. My friend had a broken ankle last year and could barely get around campus do to this."
College Sophomore,1,Not really a lot of transportation everyone walks
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare. If you're driving in for class, make sure to get there a good 30 minutes early and bring plenty of quarters (or pay for a parking pass, though it'll take you 10-20 minutes to walk from there too unless you get under Jefferson). If you're a freshman (or even a sophomore living on campus), there is no reason to have a car because it's extremely inconvenient."
College Sophomore,1,Dining halls serve low quality food. Definitely can get tired of it after a while. A meal at the market is worth half as much as a meal at the dining hall. On top of that all of the market prices are jacked up.
College Freshman,1,Parking during the summer is about 150 and during the school year about 200. There is off-campus parking for freshmen but it's an fair distance away depending on which green you live on.
Recent Alumnus,1,I really hated it. I hate how you can't use any of the bobcat cash uptown. If you were able to spend those points on Pita Pit my entire freshman and sophomore years would have been different food wise. I'm a picky eater and the dining hall never did it for me.
College Senior,1,The college offers no student housing on this campus.  The housing adjacent to the college is too expensive for most students.
College Sophomore,1,You can't get a parking spot as a freshman and parking services take their job too seriously.
College Freshman,1,The girls at this school do not respect themselves. They feel the need to wear next to nothing and get completely hammered just to have a good time or to impress guys that are only interested in getting them in bed. There are the few exceptions as always however the vast majority have much maturing to do before a relationship or even marriage should be considered.
College Sophomore,1,"This school doesn't offer very much financial aid. It's a very expensive school and the amount that they are willing to give you isn't much at all. Your GPA in high school has no effect. The only thing they take into consideration is ACT or SAT scores, which if you're not a good test-taker could be very bad. I had a 4.0 GPA in high school and got a 28 on my ACT, while receiving only $1000 dollars at OU for scholarships, compared to the free-ride I could have gotten at other smaller schools."
College Sophomore,1,"Ohio University did not get named ""the #1 party school in America"" for nothing. There are drugs and alcohol everywhere you turn..but there are equally as good Christian groups etc. But drug safety is not too good."
College Freshman,1,"At Ohio University, the population is mostly white students. We have a decent amount of black students, and a semi-big group of Asians, who are always together. If you come, you will see a lot of the black students trying to get the rest of the black community come together as one. As far as economic background? In the case, the Asians would be ""rich"", but no one really pays attention to that. Ohio University is very accepting of people's sexual orientation."
College Sophomore,1,"I live off campus and I must drive in. The fine for a permit is $100. There is rarely a place to park. Also expect many of the lots to be closed due to ""events occurring in the area."" Many times, the parking services will shut down lots for basketball games, football games, random conferences, and other stuff, during the weekday. There have been a few times, when I have been late to class because I was unaware of a lot being closed. Also if you park on campus without a permit, expect a fine anywhere between $20-$100. One quarter, I had a class at 8pm on Thursday nights. I would go home after my 2pm class ended then come back. However, many times the lots nearest to the building were closed because of basketball games or swim meets. So, if I wanted to be safe and park close by, I would have to pay to go to my class. That was not a pleasant quarter at all."
College Sophomore,1,There is no parking for more than 10 hours. It is very difficult to have a guest over. They ticket a ton on campus.
College Freshman,1,Only bad and stupid stories about them. They do nothering good for campus.
College Senior,1,"PARKING: Do not mess with the parking restrictions on/around campus/uptown. You WILL get a ticket (or towed, booted, etc.) if you park somewhere you don't have a permit for, or if you stay past your limit at a parking meter. End of that discussion."
College Sophomore,1,"There's a reason OU has been voted as one of the biggest party schools in America. Most nights, the bars uptown are filled with students, and off-campus housing near campus is full of drunken partygoers each weekend. Some people smoke marijuana in the dorms, but that is generally punished by RAs. The biggest problem, in my opinion, is the prevalence of cigarettes on campus. The rules, other than no smoking indoors, typically are not enforced, but there is a task force convening to discuss banning cigarettes on campus (http://thepost.ohiou.edu/content/task-force-discusses-tobacco-free-campus-resolution).

However, the university and town do a great job of providing alternate activities for students who don't want to get involved, like comedy shows, athletic events and the like. It's just unfortunate that more people don't take advantage of this."
College Senior,1,"Greek life here is terrible.  It is only a small percentage of the students (especially for the guys).  I've never met a frat dude that was not a complete ""chach.""  I've been told by tons of frat guys that I'm friends with that they hate most of the people in their fraternity and that they wish they had never joined (reasons include bad grades, drug/alcohol problems, money issues, fights etc).  Many older guys talked me out of joining a fraternity myself when I came to OU.  There are more sororities and life in these is a little bit better although the general consensus is that most of them are bitches."
College Sophomore,1,Almost every professor I have had here is not willing to help you out when you need it. They basically just tell you you are on your own and tell you to figure it out yourself.
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's Not Great â During the day during the week, it's almost impossible to find a spot anywhere near campus. The dorms are all within walking distance, and most of the off-campus apartments have buses, but if you live in a house, you pretty much have no choice but to walk 10-15 minutes."
College Sophomore,1,"OU is great, except when it comes to parking. The campus doesn't offer a lot of spaces that can be used day to day for students living in apartments. Your only real option is to hunt for a metered space, and if you are lucky and find one, you have to feed the meters every two hours. If you live on campus, they charge you a rediculous amount of money to park in one of their lots. I found it's best to go to the private sector for parking.. its often cheaper and in some cases closer to where you need to be."
College Senior,1,"OU provides little to no transportation. In my four years of being there, I have seen the ""Cat Cab"" once. The majority of the transportation is provided through apartment complexes and the Go Bus. There are two cab cars that drive around town, but even in Athens, Ohio can be quite pricey."
College Freshman,1,Theres not alot of diversity at all on this campus. To be honest it is mostly whites and asian people but not alot of diversity beyond that.
College Sophomore,1,"I think the school tries to be strict, but in reality is not strict at all. People still act foolish and get away with it."
College Sophomore,1,"We're Hot and We Know It â We have an average population, and by that I mean we have a little bit of everything. Guys range from hipster to douche to techie to athlete, and same with the girls. There is nice variety."
College Junior,1,There are many housing options all of which are overpriced. I could easily find a one bedroom in Cincinnati for half as much as I pay for my apartment here with 3 roommates.
College Freshman,1,"Sucks. a Lot. The experience that I've had with financial aid at OU is really just awful. They offer everyone the same loan that they make sound special, but it has a bad interest rate and it's very limited on what you can use it on. They almost never give financial aid, and when they do the system usually doesn't work so you have to pay the full amount anyway and get a refund later. F*** that, right?"
College Freshman,1,"Need More Patrols â Campus policy says underage consumption is not tolerated nor is drug use and anyone observed or possessing such related items are expelled.  This was found to be false when at orientation I observed 3 students using a large bong on the patio of one of the campus coffee shops.  I reported it and was told it would be taken care of, however it wasn't.  Then my dorm was the scene of an arsonist attack that has yet to be solved.  The police should have known something was up when the arsonist conducted several dry runs on consecutive nights before setting the first floor ablaze on a cold rainy night at 4am.  To make matters worse, we had to stand out in the cold and rain for over an hour before they let us into another facility to get warm."
College Sophomore,1,"Rains a Few Times a Week â It tends to rain alot here, good thing my classes are not very far from my dorm. The rain in Athens is very annoying."
College Sophomore,1,Parking in Athens sucks. It's almost impossible to not get a ticket unless you have a parking pass and freshmen aren't allowed to have cars unless they commute so be careful.
College Senior,1,There is this one dick head professor at OU in the ETM department who never gives anyone an A.
College Sophomore,1,"White, Straight, Republican â Most people like to think that there is diversity when it comes to background and political belief at Ohio University, but in reality there is very little diversity. Most of the people here are straight, white, Republicans who come from the suburbs or farms of Cleveland, Columbus, or Cincinnati. However, this does not mean that students are not accepting. Anyone could feel comfortable here if they make an effort to break out and meet people."
College Freshman,1,"If plan to party and take an easy major, OU is the school for you. If you take your studies seriously and want to get into a science, math or technology field, stay far away. I am a computer science major and most of my professors are useless. I have to teach myself the information or I don't do well. If I weren't stuck here because of my scholarship, I would be headed somewhere more useful. I'm actually worried about applying to grad school somewhere else because I feel like I will be behind in comparison to other students."

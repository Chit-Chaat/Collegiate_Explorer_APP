Sophomore,5,It’s a fantastic school with amazing professors and advisors. You truly are in good hands to excel because everyone is in board with you and ready to help and support you.
Freshman,5,They have a very well developed online learning network. It has worked well for everyone I know. They offered hybrid classes so that there was a mix of digital and in person learning
Freshman,5,Fantastic campus and in a great location. It is also affordable and has good clubs and activities. They offer many scholarships and financial aid opportunities. Highly recommend!
Junior,5,"Everything went smoothly as I wished. The welcoming environments are nice and made my academic journey fuller in experiences. Because of smaller class size, it made personal connection with instructors/professors deeper.
Definitely, this is a great university for adult learners like I am."
Senior,5,"Overall, I have really enjoyed USM. Great professors and a school that really cares. It is also a great school for non-traditional students looking to go back to school or start college for the first time!"
Senior,5,I have really enjoyed taking online classes with USM. The professors make it easy to follow along and they answer any questions you may have quickly.
Sophomore,5,"University of southern Maine is a Wonderful education system. I have made progress of one year towards my BSN so far and have not had a negative experience with anyone I've come across in the school system. Staff and professors are there to see you succeed, and are eager to help you whenever you may need it."
Alum,5,Provided me the basis for a solid career i the military and education. Solid and affordable. No regrets at all graduating from this fine university.
Junior,5,I have always enjoyed USM. There are plenty of opportunities there and they listen to their students. Instead of closing they went online and are doing the best they can with the current situation at hand. They even accepted me back after several years off so I can finish my degree. Poor GPA or not I have enjoyed my experience here and would recommend to any new college student or returning especially if you live in the area.
Sophomore,5,"Great location, good for commuters, good for those who prefer a smaller school, great professors who take the time to get to know you, feels more comfortable for those looking to smoothly get through college"
Freshman,5,"For me the University of Southern Maine was close to home, and offered the best nursing program out of all the colleges that I looked at. They are a tight knit school that wants to do their best for you/"
Junior,5,The staff are very helpful when it comes to issues I have with courses and finances or any other college life problems.
Sophomore,5,My overall experience at USM has been great! I went in with a different idea of what college life would be like and my professors were wonderful with helping me with this transition.
Niche User,5,"I attended this university for my freshman year before I had to transfer to fulfill my major, but I every second I attended. All the professors that I had were very attentive when I needed help or explanation and they were actively interested in what they were talking about which made lectures more interesting. I was a part of the Track and Field team and loved my experience with teammates and my coaches. I very much recommend this university."
Freshman,5,"My experience at University of Southern Maine has been amazing thus far. I have been able to connect with the faculty and my peers with ease. I am a commuter student, and it has been incredibly easy for me to blend in with the non-commuter students, and there is such a community of commuter students, which is refreshing."
Junior,5,"I love this college. Portland is amazing. The school offers many majors, and opportunities for the young students. Its fun and affordable."
Sophomore,5,"It's not a traditional college at all which allows me to thrive in my professionalism. It's a college for everyone so I'm always meeting people from a large pool of races and ages, which allows me to grow my prospective. We have the balance of city life that has opportunities and our quiet residential campus that allows a more relaxed and focused attitude."
Alum,5,"The University of Southern Maine (USM) is a great public university that spans two campuses, one in Portland and the other in Gorham. Each campus serves a variety of the different programs available but also offers students different changes in scenery from a city atmosphere in Portland, to the small town feels of Gorham. With the variety of programs available, USM offers all students chances to study where their interests and future careers will take them.
USM is also a welcoming community to students from all backgrounds and stands to make them welcome. There are a lot of resources available to students to use as well as student communities and groups.
With USM, my experience there was one of the best I can say, building strong relationships with faculty, my department and fellow peers as well as a solid education in my field."
Freshman,5,I love University of Southern Maine because of how affordable and accommodating they are to the students. I also love the location and how there is easy access to everything from food to fun. I also like how they have free train passes for all of the students.
Sophomore,5,The professors are fair and there are a variety of classes offered.  The university is very diverse.  There are a variety of academic programs.  The university has several campuses so people don't have to travel very far.
Niche User,5,"I really liked the area! It was close to the city and stores, which I liked. Their open house was great, I learned a lot about the college. The campus was beautiful. The area felt safe as well. They have two campuses, and they have a bus to drive students between them. I've been accepted and am planning on attending this year. I can't wait until 2019 when they finish making new dorms on their second campus."
Freshman,5,"Though I'm just beginning my journey in attaining higher education, this university stands out as being remarkably clean and organized. From word of mouth the reviews I've read of USM, there is little reason to not want to attend this school if you reside within the Portland area. Its financial services staff and advisors are professional and diligently serve to ensure that students succeed, and the professors are dedicated to their students. Thus far, I'm rather quite impressed with the experience."
Freshman,5,University of Southern Maine is an amazing school with three campuses with tons of options! The athletics are super competitive and the academics are fantastic. The school is also extremely affordable for both in state and out of state students.
Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing and required themselves to make time for the students, whether it be one on one or in a group. Deals on campus are very helpful for regular full-time college kids. There are plenty of activities for students to participate in together. There is never a dull moment at USM."
College Junior,5,Baseball is the number one sport on campus.
College Senior,5,I always feel extremely safe on campus. I often take night classes so I have to walk to the garage late at night. I have never felt uncomfortable walking alone.
College Sophomore,5,I love USM! The majority of professors are helpful and everyone is friendly.
College Senior,5,"My courses are exactly what I need to pass my boards to become a Licenced clinical professional counselor in Maine. All courses are content rich and our professors are active in their fields, not just academic majors. They bring a variety of study styles to enrich our experience and are always empathic and caring."
College Senior,5,"Though I am unaware of any specific incident details, I can say that we receive alerts if there has been any suspicious activity on or near campus (Portland in integrated into the community while Gorham is more secluded.). They encourage students to be alert always and walk in pairs in Portland. Also, every bathroom stall has Hotline information to report incidents, reach our for crisis help or simply request counseling, all confidential."
College Senior,5,"As I stated previously, I have attended many colleges. This is the first time (USM) that I met and was interviewed by department chairs during the admission process. At USM, they want to make sure they understand your goals, the school requirements and how these fit together to make sure you're a match. My interviewers were very interested in my future aspirations and how the program I chose would help me achieve them."
College Senior,5,"I've attended many colleges and USM has offered the best experience I've had. As a non-traditional student, I've always felt like an ""outsider"".  That is not the case at USM where my professors know my name, my advisor is always available to me and the department members are eager to assist."
College Junior,5,I honestly cannot say enough about the program that I am in at USM. Occupational therapy is most certainly my calling and I know that the education that I am receiving will prepare me to be highly successful. The professors go above and beyond for the students and treat them as individuals. Not once have I felt like I have been left in dust and on my own. The standards and expectations for students are clearly defined at the beginning of the program and there are no surprises along the way.
College Junior,5,"I was incredibly unsure of which graduate program I wanted to attend. I am originally from Massachusetts, so choosing to go to a school that was out of state was a big decision. However, as soon as I drove up for the interview I was certain that if I got accepted to the program I would attend. The attitudes of the professors at USM were amazing and it was clear from the start that if I went to USM I would be surrounded by individuals who want me to succeed and would prepare me to do so."
College Senior,5,I've been able to explore many different interests.
College Senior,5,"I've made many connections, both with fellow students and with faculty.  This school is close to my heart.  Four of my family members are alumni."
College Student,5,All are welcome as they are.  Everyone is equal
College Student,5,Health and Science   many opportunities
College Student,5,I have learned a lot and feel it has been the money
College Student,5,Great food in the area easy to get around
College Student,5,I feel very secure and have been lucky to have no issues arise on campus.
College Student,5,I am involved with the wrestling team.  Coaches and team mates are very supportive in all areas of college life.  They have given me knowlege and confidence to more  forward to my next year.  A Big Thank You to all who helped me.
College Student,5,Great places eat near school and the prices are average.  The dining cost are average and how much money you want to spend
College Student,5,Very helpful and gave me a full explanation of what I was offered and what I had to pay out.  They gave me a grant  I had not anticipated  for my second semester.  This was a big help to me and my family.
College Senior,5,"Portland is literally the best place to eat, with the most restaurants per capita in the country. Gorham has more discounts for students, but less nice and fewer restaurants."
College Sophomore,5,I love the small town environment Gorham provides and the some-what city life in Portland.
College Sophomore,5,I love the night life at USM!
College Sophomore,5,I love how small and friendly the class sizes are!
College Sophomore,5,I don't live off-campus but my friends say they prefer it!
College Junior,5,There is a little bit of everything in the city.  The choices are endless.
College Junior,5,"Portland, Maine is a beautiful city with a friendly atmosphere and plenty of things to do.  Portland has been said to be the ""nicest city in America"" because of its low crime rates and pleasant atmosphere.  The town council of Gorham is generally not very fond of the college because the state of Maine is run primarily by grumpy old men who think everything is a bad idea.  This does not affect the quality of life at all.  Portland is great.  There is a local ice Hockey team, the Portland Pirates, and a baseball team The Sea Dogs.  Their games are very exciting."
College Junior,5,This school has every thing and everyone.
College Junior,5,"Being near the city means that there are available apartments everywhere.  If you are looking to live in Portland then the possibilities are endless with apartments and there is even a building ""Bayside"" that offers apartments to any students of the University of Southern Maine and Southern Maine Community College.  There are even options for off campus living in the town of Gorham if that is where you prefer to stay, from apartments to renting out houses.  The University of Southern Maine is predominantly a commuter college so more people live off campus than live on campus."
College Junior,5,Hello Portland! There are so many options around. Streets are lined with a variety of restaurants and small diners.
College Junior,5,"Portland Maine is the best place to eat in the United States.  There's Grace, a restaurant in a church, or Pom's, fastest Thai in the land, or Old Port, for great eating/drinking variety, or Asmara, Eritrean food.  And, of course, there is Otto's, the best damn pizza in all the land, with the best people working there, and the best late night hours.  Portland is where you come specifically to eat."
College Junior,5,"I am so proud, impressed, challenged, and motivated with/by the English Department at USM.  Stellar faculty, stellar students, engaging classes, dynamic options, and a surprising community feel.  From dancing with an English professor at a concert of French pop tunes by a student, to stopping by the office to discuss Othello and the nature of the Villain with the Department Chair, a Shakespearean Scholar, I have nothing but praise and good memories to offer from my time spent with the department."
College Junior,5,"Portland is an awesome place to live.  Plenty to do, music, sports, drinking, EATING (best restaurant city in the US according to most reviewers), and yet it's a tiny city, barely over 60,000 pop.  It's got the feel and ambiance of a big city, but it's quiet, safe, and has the sort of ""everybody knows everybody"" quality inherent to Maine culture."
College Junior,5,The only students that complain are those that don't like walking.
College Sophomore,5,"Portland is a great little city where everything is right near each other and there is always something to do if you look for it. There are art walks in the summer, shopping at local shops and so many great places to eat that is non chain. There are places to play sports, watch minor league sports, and well the city is great but I wish it was easier to meet people. Then again, maybe I am just a hermit."
College Sophomore,5,"I do not live on campus or even off campus housing in the area, but this is a safe campus. There is no violence or safety concerns that would make me feel that I need to not trust those around me."
College Freshman,5,"There are many internships available for computer science, and each of the professors is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. "
Niche User,4,"I really liked my professors and classes.  They were helpful and enthusiastic about their subjects.  I transferred because I wish to pursue a specific major, however I truly enjoyed my time at USM. I studied Biology."
Niche User,4,"My professors had an interesting time switching their mode of teaching. Overall I think they handled the situation as best they could. They were understanding of everyone's background and their personal struggles. One of the my classes was already online. The only difference was not having an in-person exam, however the test was similar in format to others we had taken over the semester so I was comfortable with the change."
Freshman,4,I like the small campus but there is two linked campuses which makes classes a bit inconvenient if you have classes back to back on different campuses.
Junior,4,"I am not typical student and I have many different experiences prior in my life. Shifting from physical learning to online one simply gave me more options to learn even more so than ever before. I'm sure the majority of both teachers and students struggled the transition, but the struggle was not my personal experience."
Freshman,4,The University of Southern Maine has been very reliable and up to date since I enrolled there. They're always emailing me with updates and the staff is amazing. The University overall is very clean and parking is never an issue as I am a commuter. Even now with COVID the university of southern Maine has been awesome with updates and helping us transition. Go huskies!
Sophomore,4,"My time in the University of Southern Maine was awesome. It is true that there's a lot of workload, but the professors are dedicated in helping students succeed and give out a very detailed handout of what to complete in what timeframe and how to complete it. The professors are also very vocal about reminding students that they are a resource we should take advantage of--alongside USM's other academic resources such as tutoring and peer review in the Glickman Library. There is a lot of diversity and I met people from all walks of life, and it was fascinating to make friends with them and hear about their stories as we discussed class topics. Although it does get annoying when one has to go back and forth from Gorham and Portland campuses due to split-up classes. USM tries to make up for it by free bus transport but the trip still takes an hour, give or take, but they were considerate enough for the bus system so I think it's fine."
Freshman,4,"It's my first year and I graduated a year early from high school.  I commute to school like many students and I don't feel that I miss out on anything just because I don't live on campus.  I've had GREAT luck with professors: understanding, respectful, and fair."
Junior,4,I have been attending USM for almost 3 years now studying history. USM is a great school with many great professors. The history department is small and we are not always given the same opportunities as other departments. I hope in years to come this changes.
Freshman,4,"I think people usually come down too hard on usm, sure it ain't great but its a public university, that's not surprising. the dorms are pretty typical college dorms, woodward is newly renovated so of course its the nicest. i really enjoyed most of my classes during the first semester. my professors were all very helpful and willing to meet with me. there are no parties on campus, and if there are they get shut down quick, but if you're like me, thats good since then you don't have to deal with the noise. there's been some issues with sodexo, our food company, but there are a lot of options for food and simple servings in the back of brooks has really good options usually."
Freshman,4,"I have been attending for around 4 months. So far so good! I love all the new people I've met, students and teachers are very friendly. I would love to see more activities around campus though!"
Freshman,4,"I am currently enrolled as a freshman studying Business Management: Entrepreneurship & Small Business and Marketing. Practically my entire family has attended USM: my mother, brother, sister, uncle, cousins, grandmother, etc. So far I love USM due to all the different courses they offer that are of my interest. I have also noticed that all of my professors are passionate about the subjects they teach and truly want their students to learn. I have made friends and many acquaintances who are kind and also great to study with. I like how USM offers little events, for example free breakfast smoothies or lunch which are helpful and convenient for college students. The overall campus is a nice size and it is the vicinity of the Old Port which is nice for students to have. I am grateful for USM and also the financial scholarships they offer for those who have trouble affording the tuition, like myself."
Freshman,4,"The School of Music is by far the most put together part of the school. The dorms in general aren't bad despite the fact that most freshman are living in forced triples. There could be worse conditions to be living in. The food is awful. Sodexo is capable of making good and edible food, but more often than not doesn't. It's always a fun guessing game of what will I find in my food this time."
Freshman,4,"Great diversity, teachers focus on individual students! Although it is my first year of college, I have been influenced by the new setting and community that it has to offer. As it is known that higher education can improve health and wealth, I strive for these accomplishments while also learning about things that are of great interest to med. To reference professor's Bishop and Verleger, college provides a “unique combination of learning theories” (Berger, 511). I make great use of massive open online courses (MOOC), which help me complete school work without having to be physically present for a class. The diversity in the University of Southern Maine has exposed me to various cultures that I otherwise would not have purposefully exposed myself to. With this, I have learned that although people may come from a different area of the world, our ability to connect to each other is not affected, only enriched."
Sophomore,4,"I came here because its affordable and I need to get my degree but other than that its not great, if you want to come here to get your degree for less money than other schools its good for that but other than that I wouldn't recommend coming here if you see it as your 'dream' school."
Sophomore,4,"Good school, students are focused and its one of the most affordable universities in New England. Nursing program is strong and the staff and faculty are very kind and helpful."
Niche User,4,"I am taking early college classes at USM while I finish my senior year at high school. I am taking a Marine Biology course and a College Writing course, thus far, my experience has been reassuring and easy to manage, and I have learned a lot! My professor for Marine Biology is not extremely passionate because it is an intro class (with lots of non-majors), but my College Writing professor has made the writing process a lot easier for me. I highly suggest USM!"
Freshman,4,"I like the surrounding area that the University of Southern Maine is in. I personally think that the safety on this campus is excellent, they really go out of the way to make sure everyone feels safe and welcomed. The academics at this school from what I can tell so far are very good, all of the professors are here for you and your success and will do whatever they can to help you succeed. Not only the professors but all of the staff and even your peers are willing to help you when you need it, academically and personally. The University of Southern Maine prides themselves on being ""the university of everyone"" and I believe that to be true, there is an average amount of diversity at this school from what I have encountered, but everyone is treated with the same respect regardless."
Junior,4,"University of southern is a small university,  so the class size is small. Instructor to student ratio is less than 1:15.
For engineering majors, the courses offered are limited. A student might have to wait more than a year to take a course."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, USM was really good. It was my first for year college I attended after I transferred from a community college. All the teachers I had was really good and did not have anyone to complain about. The food here is very limited and fattening. I had bad experience with roommates so I don't recommend the dorms. Try to rent local."
Freshman,4,It’s  nice and calm. But they don’t garuntee housing for anyone past a first year. The programs are nice but it could me more of a home like experience with more communal effort
Sophomore,4,"The University of Southern Maine is a great school for in state students to get their bearings with college. The staff and faculty are super kind and the classes are enriching. There are on-campus issues, however, like housing, parking, and dining that must be resolved. Sodexo is not ideal and has caused dietary issues, and there is not enough parking or housing for students."
Junior,4,"I am very satisfied with the education I am receiving at the University of Southern Maine. This is my second bachelor’s degree and have received amazing support by both professors and advisors about accomplishing my academic goals. I appreciate the flexibility of having classes offered at different times, formats, and locations across the state. The diversity of the student body has also enriched my academic experience here. I find the academic rigor of the courses challenging. If I could change one thing about the University is that I would expand the courses available at satellite campuses. Overall, I highly recommend the University of Southern Maine."
Sophomore,4,For an adult going back to school I find it is a supportive environment. It has its confusion when it comes down to which adviser to meet for classes but of overall I have no regrets. I enjoy the education I'm receiving and the community atmosphere!
Alum,4,The university is supportive to non-traditional/older students.  The science department has some wonderfully dedicated professors.
Junior,4,"The University of Southern Maine has three different campuses- due to this, the students who I have had witness to also attending, are from many backgrounds. Being among such a diverse population of individuals has opened my eyes to the world in which we live. From traditional and non-traditional students, to on campus and commuter students, to undergraduate and graduate students; all of which may come from very different cultures. Being a non-traditional student who grew up in a very close-minded family, I have grown more in my time of attendance at the University of Southern Maine then my whole life."
Junior,4,"School is great with tons of diversity, tons of student engagement going on all the time, sports games are fun to go to, the school has a lot of pride. Tons of travel and field trip opportunities, community service, internship and job fairs. The only negative thing would be lack of resources for students, they seem to lack advisors, and it is very difficult to make an appointment with yours when you need it because they are always booked full."
Freshman,4,Something I would like to see change about this school is the food. The food isn't great here. And the RA's are very aggressive and don't let kids have fun. I think they need to loosen up a bit.
Niche User,4,I like that they offer high school students the opportunity to take classes there. They have a wide variety of classes that cover multiple areas of interest. ?The application process is very understanding and not too difficult. All the professors I've had are very nice and helpful and accommodating to students needs.
Sophomore,4,"I like how the faculty makes you feel like a person and caters to your interests, rather than make you feel like a statistic. I don't like how the advertising is geared mostly in Portland, when there isn't even dorms on the Portland campus"
Alum,4,"I loved the Science program, absolutly incredible! I would say if there is anything i could change it would be to open up more availibity for classes, the classes fill up so fast."
Freshman,4,"University of Southern Maine has a friendly environment. It is very easy to find your way around campus because it is fairly small. There are also a ton of maps around to help you on your way. If there are no maps around, asking someone would do the trick! The professors are willing to help you with any issues or concerns. They have an excellent tutoring program at USM that is free as well! There are so many different ways to succeed here!"
Freshman,4,Classes and professors are typically great. Campus life however is not the best. The food is terrible and most housing conditions are rundown and outdated.
Sophomore,4,I am a music ed major.  I have really enjoyed USM.  The opportunities that have been given are beyond measure.  The hardest thing about the college is getting the financial aid department to help.  My bill has been more than expected each semester and it has been a struggle to come up with the additional funding.
Sophomore,4,USM has a variety of classes and a variety of programs.  They have multiple campuses throughout the state.
Freshman,4,The only thing I disliked about the university is that they increased my tuition for the following year.
Freshman,4,Being a freshman in college can be a weird experience but USM helped me through that experience and made the transition from high to college as smooth as possible.
Freshman,4,"I've fun, new college experiences and made many new friends so far.  There is a large amount of diversity among students. The university provides a great learning environment for all students."
Freshman,4,I would like to see the diversity and the opportunities for student application to change. To be able to see more opportunities to do things outside of school work and sports.
Junior,4,It's a good school with great teachers. It has a commuter lounge and a large cafeteria on the Portland campus. There are many places to study around campus. My only complaint is the increase in tuition.
Freshman,4,"It will be nice if there can be a Reduction in tuition as well as in housing and dorms.

I know a friend  whom would have love to attend but, cost of living expenses and tuition wouldn't allow that.

USM is a great place to be to define your tomorrow and achieve all your  dreams and goals."
Freshman,4,"I've enjoyed my first semester at USM. The school overall is okay! I love the Music Department. I'm a Music Education Major, and I couldn't be happier in my department. I love the music staff and most of my classes. The food is okay, The campus is okay, there's a town square that's in walking distance with Hannafords, Goodwill, Burger King, Rite Aid, and theres a shuttle that takes you to the Portland Campus, and downtown Portland is about a 20 minute walk from there."
Senior,4,USM is a very involved in the community and is very open to diversity. The culture is phenomenal and school pride permeates every aspect of student life.
Freshman,4,"The University of Southern Maine is an amazing, diverse, and supportive campus. Not only is everyone in Maine kind, but the employees and students at this school are polite, generous, and extremely considerate of one another. The only thing that I personally would like to see changed is the temperature of the food. It comes out cold most of the time, but for a school having that as the only complaint is pretty wonderful."
Junior,4,"Great location in Portland Maine. The only downside is that there are 2 campuses. The food is decent, but could be better."
Junior,4,I like the diversity at USM and the science field professors. The professors are very good at teaching.
Freshman,4,"I like that as a nursing major I have a very straight forward path over the next four years. What I don't like is the old dorms, the lack of cleanliness inside the buildings, and the Sodexo food."
Sophomore,4,"Small school, split campus, good community. Portland is beautiful and Gorham is nice in the spring/fall. I would like to see the campus move to just Gorham because that's where most of it is but Portland is such a nice environment to be."
Sophomore,4,"As a sophomore at the University of Southern Maine, I have enjoyed the semesters that I have lived on campus. It is a small campus making it fairly easy to make friends and find your way around. I think if the university could change one thing it would be their dinning services, they are not always appetizing or feasible."
Sophomore,4,"Gorgeous campus, dorms are maintained well, very diverse and huge into sports. Flaws, resident parking can be a pain as it is limited, meal plans are a bit pricey considering the little options available. Overall, great learning environment and an enjoyable place to be."
Freshman,4,The biggest thing I enjoyed the most about the school was how many activities and resources there were for the students.
Freshman,4,There's always fun and engaging events for students throughout the week. There's transportation between campuses and there is a variety of food! Overall I love the experience I have been having at this university.
College Sophomore,4,"My experience of course and my professors have been good, most of them are really helpful and I really enjoy most of my classes. Some of my class sizes are big and some of them are maybe 15 people."
College Sophomore,4,The school does a good job at educated and protected students.
College Sophomore,4,"From living in a freshmen dorm and now the upperclass dorm, there is a difference. But I liked living in both, but I like upperclass better; my own bathroom, three roommates, small kitchen area of sink, counter and cabinets and a living area. Also AC and heat control in my room."
College Sophomore,4,They are a big part of our campus life for athletes and past athletes. Most of the attendance are students who have been athletes or are athletes in college.
College Sophomore,4,My teachers have been really helpful when I need help with something I am struggling with and my advisor has been helpful with class schedule and figuring out what I need to do to be successful.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't tried to use many of these services yet but I know that we have a lot and they are very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty safe on the Gorham campus. The Portland campus feels a little less unsafe because it is connected more with the public community of Portland.
College Sophomore,4,"This school has its ups and downs as most do. Some professors are very uncaring and expect much more out of students than they may be able to give. However, we do have many great professors who do care for the students and take time to help them whenever necessary. There have been classes I have loved because of my professor and classes that I have hated because of my professor. I think the USM campus has a nice, safe feel and I like that it's a smaller school. We have fun events regularly and it's very easy to get involved on campus, which I enjoy doing. The food is usually pretty awful though and there aren't many options for what to eat. That's probably my least favorite thing about the school."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel pretty safe in the gorham campus, and a little less safe in the portland campus."
Senior,2,"Not sure how anybody could come here for multiple classes and rate this school 4 stars.
Dirty, with awful professors."
Freshman,2,Go somewhere else anywhere else. This school is slowly falling apart and very overcrowded. It’s not worth it. Its not fun
Graduate Student,2,The University of Southern Maine is all that most Maine residences can afford but it leaves something to be desired. The advisers aren't very helpful and your program often doesn't offer the classes you need to finish your program for semesters in a row so you are forced to do another year. The food plans are expensive and there is VERY minimal parking.
Freshman,2,"Most of the professors I've had are really knowledgeable and incredibly supportive. The student life is pretty horrible, and there is very little community spirit. The Portland area is pretty great for a small city."
Freshman,2,The party life is non existing and always get shut down which is annoying but its a good school if you are not trying to party.
Alum,2,"This school is cheap and will get the job done if you want to stay in Maine. It is a commuter campus so most kids go home on the weekend so it is hard to attain the ""college experience"". Parking is terrible, other students aren't interested in making new friends, and professors constantly talk about how the school is spending money on everything but the teachers. 

If I were to do it again I probably would have gone to Saint Joe's or UNE. (Having wanted to stay in Maine)"
Freshman,2,"It's a very average school with a poor environment. Lots of outdated and old buildings with low morale. Almost depressing. The majority of students here are average with only a handful (I would consider) to be motivated and hard working. Socially, it's very cliquey. If you're not from Maine or New Hampshire it's twice as hard to make friends and acquaintances. On a positive note, (half) of the school is in Portland. It's an interesting place to be. My experience with all of my professors has been positive. They are helpful and fair."
College Junior,2,"I lived in Robie Andrews Dorm for two semesters. Overall, the social atmosphere with students here and RAs were good. They had some great activities to do during the semester and overall was good in that respect.

However, the downside of this building is that it was old, the internet wasn't that great there, they put me in a quad (that had no doors separating the two rooms linked. Mostly roommates had to pass through my room to get to their room), and the price was too high for what I got back!"
College Senior,2,"USM doesn't offer off campus housing. Bayside is an awful place to live, and Portland rent is very high. Most students are older and off campus already though."
College Sophomore,2,"Currently, USM is cutting some majors and there is quite a bit of controversy surrounding this decision. A few student protests last semester and a lot of Facebook groups is all that really happened, but they still cut a chunk off the science program. Other than that, no one really feels safe in their major any more, with Physics and Geo-sciences gone."
College Junior,2,Parking is a bit of a walk. So the walk from the parking lot or any other buildings creates soaked students. Winter is fun as well for the snow bit. A good part however is that the campus is taken care of so that there isnt icy walkways or roads.
College Junior,2,If the campus did not have shuttle I would never know there was an outside world. Taxis charge 30 to 60.  Rides from students are non existent unless the person is trying to date you.
College Junior,2,No car and you don't have the ability to participate.
College Sophomore,2,They show up due to noise complaints and check for alcohol and drugs
College Sophomore,2,"I have not been in one, but there are very few and they are not very apealing on the outside. There was an incident of a drunk student who brang a loaded weapon in one of theses house and threatened the roomates to kill them all. I stay away from that area."
College Sophomore,2,"There is hardly any nightlife, especially in Gorham, and in Portland it would depend on your sense of adventure and who you hang with"
College Sophomore,2,the party scene is awful and they kids in the frats are so weird
College Sophomore,2,"this school lacks that. you can only rely on house parties, and they are bias towards others. the frats are terrible too"
College Sophomore,2,"In the winter, sometimes the pathways don't get plowed right away or they are plowed but the ice adds up quickly and it is just a hazard really, but i think there is a lack in the outdoor staff"
College Junior,2,"it snows a lot, but the spring and summer are nice, and the fall is beautiful to see."
College Sophomore,2,"The actual school does not really host that many parties (if any).  There are only a few clubs in Portland, all of which require you to  be 21 to enter.  Although it lacks in the field of hosting parties, it is very close to the center of Portland, so everything is a walk away from the campus!"
College Junior,2,Completely and utterly dead unless you're over 21 or are risking the rage of an iron-grip RA in a freshman dorm.
College Freshman,2,"There is a building where USM students can apply to live there, but you have to have four people rooming together and it cost so much to live there each month. Other than that most USM students find apartments in Portland, so they don't to pay the ridiculous housing payments"
College Senior,2,"Barely lit walk ways, walking alone never feels safe."
College Senior,2,Most are stuck-up and unfriendly. Average looking people that think they are better than everyone else.
College Freshman,2,"When it's rainy it can be a hazard, especially if you're living on the Gorham campus and have to drive to Portland for classes. Not only that, but the floors tend to get wet and slippery and even the Gorham campus classes are a decent walk from the dorms."
College Sophomore,2,Get Your Own Car – Car is the best option. The buses are unreliable and there isn't much out here. Its hard to get anywhere.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much – There isn't much. As a transfer student there was no direction or satisfaction from the student body and no hang outs for the geeky/gamer scene anywhere. Most of the social life is through the either through the dorms or fraternities/sororities. When you are not interested in that scene there isn't much left for you at this school, unless you grew up in the surrounding times."
College Sophomore,2,"Well there are some cute girls here and there, and the athletics are big here so most are in good shape - but nothing quite special here. Average grade Maine."
College Sophomore,2,"I Just Hate It – People who like all generic foods not properly cooked, if you like food that is not made with even a little bit of love, that has flies, and people sneezing on it, and is gross. You'll love their food."
College Sophomore,2,"Drinking Is Popular, Pot Second Popular, Caffeine Addiction Ranks #1 – Anyone can get alcohol, and if you are quiet in your room no one will come knocking saying ""oh, man, are you drinking""? and get you kicked out, unless you are being loud and have too many people in your room. At USM you can't have more than like 3 other people besides yourself in your room because of fire hazards, and having alcohol in your room while underage can sometimes get you expelled. 
You learn quick what pot smells like. It's like skunk cabbage. People smoke it in the open at night right at the smoking rest benches. People actually go to jail sometimes for that. Parties are big and messy and awful if you choose to go. Be warned. Be smart, remember why you are at college. Are you spending you and your parent's money to get an education or to blow on spending time drinking with people who won't remember your name in the morning?"
College Freshman,2,Could Be Better – I wish there will more scholarships available for music majors.  I feel like they should provide aid for those they know are worth it.
College Freshman,2,"Gorham Is Good, Portland Is Pitiful – If you have classes on Gorham, you'll have no problem finding parking. There are parking lots everywhere. However, in Portland there's only one parking lot and a parking garage for students. It's impossible to find parking there. The parking lot is already filled up by 8am, while at Gorham the parking lots are nearly empty. Gorham > Portland."
College Freshman,2,"It's Maine – The weather is really bipolar. It'll be nice and sunny and 60+ degrees one week and then the next week it'll be snowing. If you don't like that, than this school is not for you."
College Sophomore,2,Aramark Dining Services – The food is bland and it is always the same thing every day.
College Freshman,2,Parking is horrible. If you have a car and it snows than it is very difficult and annoying.
College Junior,2,"Wide Variety – USM has so much to offer, but does not do a good job in promoting the choices of academics at USM. Only students who work closely with the school will benefit of the events and such that is offered at USM. USM lags behind in giving out proper information due to we have more commute students then students who live on campus. Professors varies between those who love their jobs and care for students, to other professors who have to much on their plate to help students. Curriculum has changed recently and becoming much more of a burden for students then helping students progress on what they need to really learn in school. Workload depends on the choices of the student and what they choose to take about a course and how many courses they want to take."
College Junior,2,"Its a Mix. The boys and girls at my school consists of a mix at my school. With the terminology of mix, I mean, there are different varieties of studets when comparing interests, looks, and the way an individual dress's. Some individuals like myself dress casual or comfortable. Others wear like the girls at school, likes to pack on extreme make-up. The boys at school are much more diverse in the way they dress. Some boys dress in sports attire, and others dress in casual suits depending on their major or internship. Overall very diverse and mixed. Which is a good thing because if everyone dresses alike then there would be no sense of individuality."
College Senior,2,"On the Portland Campus, parking is mostly confined to side streets and the parking garage. It's hard to find parking in the parking garage most of the time during the day. Parking on the Gorham campus is difficult is you want to park near your class. There are only a few commuter lots and only 4 or 5 residential lots. This makes it tough when it snows because sometimes there aren't enough spots for everyone in the designated snow ban areas. Permits are free. The first parking ticket you get is free, but after that it's about $25 per ticket."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't too much to look forward to at the University of Southern Maine in Gorham.  The only night life is a Church that rents out to some mediocre DJ's at night, rushing a frat house, or hanging out in a dorm.  Average academics, below average athletics, and poor local atmosphere."
Freshman,1,"From what I’ve Seen the school has the worst professors known to man who want to fail you every chance they get, barely any of them speak English so it’s hard to understand any of them the campus food is bad to the point where prison food is a match to it and it’s all broken elevators doors everything."
Sophomore,1,"This school is a joke to many of its students, so many people that I know of left after freshman year and regrettably I was not one of them. The only good dorms are Philippi and Upperclass, and the food sucks. Prison food. There is barely any party scene unless you know the right people or are 21+ (they used to have greek life houses but not anymore). The teachers are alright, some I’ve had are great while others are awful. Not really any school spirit and most of the sport teams are alright. My advice is to come here if you’re on a budget and not into partying. Go to UMO if you’re looking more for that “college experience”"
Sophomore,1,"All INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AVOIDE THIS SCHOOL.

This has made me hate my academic life.
Professors dont care about you and they have a nasty unsupportive attitude.
They are all there to give you a poor grade just so you retake the class.
Please if your smart enough to get here you can get into way better colleges.
The academics you will be receiving is worth nothing.
The chemistry department sucks. I have even been accused of plagiarism. I can go on and on about this school, but it will destroy your academic career."
Sophomore,1,"Not only did I have terrible experiences living at this school, the overall education is horrible. The cafeteria is one of the worst out there, and a few teachers I have had don't understand the topics they ATTEMPT to teach. (Avoid Sharon Ritter if you come here.) Hell on earth would likely be better than living on campus. 
I am not only dissatisfied with University of Southern Maine, I am furious that they have gotten two years tuition dollars for me. Waste of time, terrible place to be."
Freshman,1,"This college is TRASH! It was the worst decision I've ever made. The campus is split which ruins any type of campus life. In Gorham, student life is more similar to a middle school summer camp than a 4 year college. The dorms are disgustingly old and outdated. There is only ONE dining hall, and it's absolutely terrible. The academics aren't bad, but they are far from good. Some of the professors I've had seem lazy. Classes are so easy you would think it is community college. I've been here one year, and I would never spend another dollar to go here. This place is like high school extended. I could go on and on. The only positives are that (half) of the school is in Portland, and the campuses are very safe."
College Sophomore,1,"There's too many old, guly, feminist marxists. Classes about anthropology have nothing to do with promoting marxism, but here they do. My computer science teacher expected everyone to already know everything. He didn't really teach us anything. It was the only class I have ever failed in my life."
College Sophomore,1,"This University is trash. Wasting my hard earned money on a degree from this University seems very irresponsible. Of course this must be obvious, because most of the people on these campuses have government blood money to pay for it, so why should they care? No internship would accept me if they knew what I was being taught in the COS field."
College Sophomore,1,"This is a horrible University. I don't know if the rest are like this but it's full of retards. The teachers are Marxist. There are people going there wasting government money on degrees that will not get them a job in the future. The classes that are useful don't have good teachers, that care to TEACH."
College Junior,1,There is no Greek life on the campus
College Junior,1,"My biggest issue with this campus is the professors and classes. For my degree (Information Technology) the professors are usually jerks and have a ""don't care"" attitude. Sure they may say they are concerned for your grade but then they go ahead and throw a bunch of homework at you and take in no consideration your life outside of school (like work). If you fall behind usually they will say ""that's too bad. Looks like you are going to fail then"" (I've been told this by three of my ""supportive"" professors this semester). Some of the classes I have should be only for the computer science degree and not for the degree I am pursuing even. Plus, I've even had a professor accuse me of plagiarism even though I did not plagiarize and in fact was getting help from a student since I didn't fully understand the subject (coding) and needed help to better understand it, and do the assignment that was tasked that week. I explained this to him and he would not see it from my perspective and failed me for the course and then proceeded to bring it to USM and now I have a first offense for it. He did this the last week of the semester too. Overall, I really dislike the professors in the technology department here and really hate this school!"
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is not big at all at USM
College Sophomore,1,Campus is like a ghost town on weekends
College Sophomore,1,"The cafe is not good. I really hate going there in Gorham. Portland is better with the Meal Exchange options after 3pm, and the Husky Hideaway(aka the crack) isn't bad, but the cafeteria in Gorham is nasty"
College Sophomore,1,"Housing is probably the worst thing on campus here in Gorham next to the food in the Cafe. The buildings other than New Hall are all way to out-dated, old, and dirty"
College Sophomore,1,"Diversity on campus is great. There is someone from every walk of life and all over the world, but there are organizations, even school funded organizations, which have caused a stir and greatly insulted other cultural sects in the school. There was one religious organization that went out of its way to instigate and alienate the LGBT community on campus with a controversial speaker. It would have been acceptable, if they hadn't singled out many members of the LGBT community and in not so many words said, ""You are wrong to live this way. You should hear how wrong you are at this speech."" It was funded by the school, and though I don't believe the school knowingly incited this singling out, I do hold them responsible for the events that occurred. Even for creating an environment in which an LGBT protest was deemed necessary against the organization who initiated the event and knowingly outraged both the campus and the surrounding community out of spite for their different beliefs!"
College Senior,1,No school spirit at all. If you want to go to games and really enjoy athletics go to umo not usm
College Freshman,1,"night life is fun if you drink enough, other than that there is nothing to do around gorham"
College Freshman,1,"Portland is beautiful and fun with lots to do, however you can't really count this as ""local atmosphere"" The school tries to advertise themselves as being close to portland when in reality Gorham is about 25 minutes away. With about 80% of the classes and all of the dorms (with the exception of 1 for upper classmen only) being in Gorham, it doesn't really count. They do have a shuttle to Portland but it's unreliable and the times that are scheduled are spaced far apart and are at odd times. Plus they're always crowded and it's a pain to have to stand for the 30 minutes it takes the bus to get there. The Gorham atmosphere is basically nonexistent, unless you want to count churches, graveyards, and pizza hut as a lively atmosphere...This school definitely manipulates the way they want to be perceived and overshadows the boring and cheap reality of the buildings, atmosphere, academics and everything in between"
College Freshman,1,"As far as majors go, the selection is average but the system is awful. I applied as being ""undecided"" on the application they ask you what your interests are. I put down that I had an interest in art, psychology, and history. They messed up and put me down as an art major and gave me a bunch of classes required for that major that were useless to me. Mistakes happen and it would have been fine but I went to the admin office to change my major back to undecided and all I got was ""Oh, you can't change your major until you have an established GPA"" So I had waste my time taking classes that weren't required or wanted by me because of a mistake they refused to make right. Freshman year was torture and I, like most others, didn't last there"
College Freshman,1,"If you miss more than 4 classes you fail automatically, no excuses! I was hospitalized for 3 days and had already missed a class due to illness. I failed although I did all my work and had a good grade in the class. I even got a hospital note, that's not good enough I guess. This ruined everything as I was attending on a scholarship that required a 2.0 or higher to receive my free education, meaning no failed classes. No alcohol on Campus even if you're 21+ you'll get ""written up"" if caught drinking like a normal 21 year old does. You can only have visitors 3 days a week and they need to sign in and out with you. The RAs pick favorites and will allow alcohol and drugs for certain students and write up others. Needless to say this place is HORRIBLE! I didn't last a semester, I lost my scholarship for this school and reapplied to the other places I had been accepted to. If you're considering this place please consider UMO or UMF, they are far better schools on ever level!"

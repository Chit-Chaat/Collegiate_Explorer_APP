Junior,5,"Very welcoming, I’m on my first year and everything has made me so excited to be here. I love Samuel Merritt!"
Junior,5,"SMU emphasizes safety and patient care above all else. The student to professor ratio is 8:1, which allows me to clarify about mishaps I have. The professors really care about what they teach and they choose students with fires in their souls. I love being around people that want to help others through all walks of life. I have never been happier attending a college before SMU! All the blood, sweat & tears are worth fulfilling my dreams of taking care of others - with love and empathy."
Freshman,5,"I am excited to attend! The people here are very nice, and the students and staff are pretty friendly."
Graduate Student,5,"Fast responses from administration and professional attitudes with qualified staffing. They treat their students more like a human rather than a number. Admission interviewers were well prepared and very knowledgeable about your resume and application. I am only just starting but I am already happy with what I am seeing from this university. I am also at the Sacramento branch, just for reference."
Sophomore,5,I've just been accepted and the whole process went really smooth. Any questions I had were answered in a timely manner via email. I am excited to start in the fall as a junior nursing student. I've been on campus visits before and i've seen state of the art labs that I am excited to use. The library and rec area seem very clean and all the students seem very studious. I cannot wait to be apart of this school.
Junior,5,I love Samuel Merritt because the staff and professors truly care about your education here and will go out of their way to help you succeed.
Graduate Student,5,"The faculty, education, and location are great. Great technology in regards to sim labs - some minor, occasional issues with classroom technology"
Senior,5,"I'm a new student at Samuel Merritt and can't wait to get started. I just finished orientation and I'm so excited to start my nursing journey with them. So far, the school has bee extremely helpful while I transition into their ABSN program."
College Senior,5,"Even though it's very challenging, this school will give me the best preparation to become a successful nurse."
College Senior,5,sacramento is really a great city it has a bad wrap
College Senior,5,"I feel that I am being well prepared for my career, which is the main priority."
College Senior,5,Professors do a good job of conveying the important information.
College Senior,5,I will be able to take the NBCOT and become an OTR.
College Junior,5,Sacramento is a very diverse city and college campus.
College Sophomore,5,Very small school but still have many places set aside for students.
College Junior,5,They have many computers and printers available for student use.
College Junior,5,"Since we are close to downtown, there are some great local places nearby."
College Junior,5,Mid range all year. 70 in january!
College Junior,5,Very focused on including and understanding diversity. 
College Freshman,5,Parking is excellent. Very spacious.
Junior,4,"The quality of education is unlike any other. The resources and tools accessible help us students thrive in our education. The tech aspect of things need minor help, but the education is amazing."
Graduate Student,4,"Samuel Merritt is an excellent college for multiple healthcare specialties. Everybody I run into on campus are very satisfied and happy with their individual programs, as am I."
Junior,4,Samuel Merritt is a reputable private school that has been educating students in various health professions for over 100 years.
Senior,4,"Samuel Merritt is a great school that I've come to truly appreciate. Although the school is not extremely large and does not have dormitories, there are other factors that merit its high ranking. SMU provides degrees in various medical fields. That being said, by specializing in a small number of degrees, the quality of instruction, classes, and students that graduate are top-notch. 

For those who want to work and learn with a diverse student body will not be disappointed. Majority of the instructors are still working professionals. And although tuition may be high, SMU graduates are highly regarded."
Freshman,4,Samuel Merritt's ABSN program is amazing. Very focused and worth the time and investment. I would like to see the San Mateo campus expand to bring more academic opportunities to the students as the program increases.
Recent Alumnus,4,They are very helpful and want you to succeed. They are personable.
College Junior,4,"NursingCAS was very time consuming, but I think it for the best."
College Senior,4,"I love that this school has the accelerated bachelors in nursing program but it is definitely tough. From day 1, you hit the ground running and there is no time for slacking off! I do think it is worth the cost and hard work but you have to be prepared from the beginning. The staff is very helpful and they want you to succeed, which is always good. I would definitely choose SMU over other schools due to three things: reputation, class size, and high standard of education."
College Sophomore,4,"The faculty are life changing, they will inspire you to become a better person!"
College Freshman,4,"Administration is very helpful, but can also be very strict"
College Freshman,4,"Extremely helpful and easy to use, but sometimes I don't hear back from the financial aid office when I email them."
College Senior,4,were a nursing school of course we are good.
College Senior,4,"Teachers, students, and faculty are all great people."
College Senior,4,There are no athletic teams so there are no facilities for that.
College Sophomore,4,"Alameda, a city near Oakland, is a surprisingly laid-back and nice place to live. Though it is not considered the safest place to be, the community is relatively nice."
College Sophomore,4,It was relatively easy to find off-campus housing.
College Sophomore,4,"So far, the physical therapy program seems very exciting and involved. As heard, the first year of the physical therapy doctorate program is very difficult."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus strictness at Samuel Merritt is enough to protect the overall well-being of the students, but not overbearing to the point where students cannot enjoy their academic and social lives. Academically, I believe the faculty expect the students to put in their best efforts to study and understand the material (e.g. to come to class and to be curious), but are approachable and relational. I don't see underage drinking because at Samuel Merritt, all students are graduate students, so most (if not all) will be of age. Drug use is not visibly prominent."
College Junior,4,"It isn't the best, it isn't the worst."
College Junior,4,"At least within my program, there is a good amount of diversity. I have friends from several different backgrounds but we all get along very well."
College Junior,4,"The OT program is great, the teachers are experienced and care about how well you're doing and are open for office hours and help (most of the time). Most are still practicing at other facilities, so they have a lot of good experience they use as examples in class."
College Junior,4,The security guards do a great job and are always present. They will walk you to your car if you stay on a campus late at night.
College Junior,4,They want you to do well but don't force you because they assume you take responsibility since it is a pre professional program.
College Junior,4,Printers are hard to get to though. 
College Junior,4,Love my teachers. Would change a few classes tho. 
College Junior,4,Accelerated program helps with time constraints. 
College Junior,4,"Like my teachers, the location and what I am going to to school for. "
College Junior,4,Oakland and SF right here. What is there more to say?
College Junior,4,"Lots of shops, attractions, big city "
College Senior,4,In a new and upcoming part of town where there are plenty of fun bars and lounges
College Senior,4,"Social scene is typical of a school area, studying, eating, or chatting.  Facilities are new, modern, clean (very important), and inviting.  Enough seating for everyone there at one time. I have never seen over crowding."
Recent Alumnus,4,SMU is not like a regular campus.  It's basically a hospital.
Recent Alumnus,4,"As a nursing student at SMU, I feel that the professors are very skilled and very qualified at teaching future nurses.  Students have access to the teachers when needed.  The only downside is waiting to be placed into preceptor facilities."
College Junior,4,It is spring time moveing into summer and the weather has been really nice so far.  The sun has been out every day since orientation and the temperature is warm but not too warm.
College Junior,4,The university is very well-known and respected. Their programs are highly recommended by recent graduates and professionals.
College Junior,4,They are very helpful in providing information about how to get to and from campus. They encourage carpooling to clinical sights.
College Junior,4,"Typical Bay Area weather. Sunny some days, overcast on others. But always bearable. Just make sure to bring a jacket just in case."
College Sophomore,4,The facilities are clean and well-kept. Everything is nice. We could expand more though
College Sophomore,4,They are pretty lenient as long as they know you are students. We are all professional students so they know to give us respect as long as we give them theirs
College Sophomore,4,"The weather is very nice. There are some rain, but that's it. It can get cold, but not really that hot."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not that emphasized on in Samuel Merritt.
College Sophomore,2,"The athletics on the Samuel Merritt campus are severely lacking. As it is a medical sciences-based university, there is not much focus on the athletics aspect."
College Junior,2,only two coffee shops that close at 5pm.
College Senior,2,Greek life is not that present. 
Recent Alumnus,2,"Since SMU is a medical centered university, there are no sports or athletics on campus.  The university gym is pretty sad as well."
College Senior,2,"the only dining is the hospital cafeteria, which is not very good"
College Junior,2,"Somewhat Safe – The campus is not in a great area.  It is unsafe to walk, especially alone, from public transit to the campus.  It would be nice to have police escorts when leaving class."
Graduate Student,1,"I haven’t changed my opinion since  I graduated in 2019. 
While the professors are kind and caring, the school admin spends more money on remodeling and marketing than giving the students a good education (just ask students how many lab hours they get, for a technical school, extremely lacking). As a former grad, I am ashamed to say this but I have to because I don’t want others to make the same expensive mistake as I did. There are much cheaper and even better nursing education out the"
Graduate Student,1,Online classes consist of forum postings and YouTube video watching. This was very disappointing to say the least. Why does it cost 100k a year to watch a YouTube video?
Graduate Student,1,"If you’re looking to learn everything on your own with no resources while burying yourself in debt, come to SMU! If you are looking for incompetent administrators that only care about profits, come to SMU! This is basically a trade school or a Caribbean school for healthcare! AVOID and save ur money, you won’t be able to pay off this school debt for decades to come"
College Junior,1,"After orientation, I was not under the impression that there were any sports at this university."
College Junior,1,No scholarships available unless military experience.

Graduate Student,5,I love the faculty and the class sizes. I also love the relationships you build due to the fact that everyone is so close. I feel as if learning in a small environment is a lot better for me because I always attended classes that were usually no bigger than 15-20 students. I've never been successful in classes with larger numbers because I feel overly pressured to perform.

Freshman,5,"As a transfer student from another school in the KCAC, I have first hand experience on what these other schools are like compared to Friends University. During high school while I looked for many different schools in the KCAC, but never gave Friends University a chance. My cousin decided he was coming here, and I knew I wanted a change to better my future. I decided to come here only based on what my cousin told me, and what I had seen online. It was difficult process to get all of my financial aid, and housing, and all academics transferred over, but the staff here stuck with me, and helped me every bit I needed. I now can see that this is the most college student prepared college in the KCAC. In my short time here, I can see the people around me love it here, and I know I will too, if I don't already. This is a great college, and I would recommend it to everyone who wants a great staff, and a great supporting community around them!"
Senior,5,"Friends University is an exceptional college. The teachers are genuine, knowing their students by name and doing everything they can to assist in the students' learning process. The fine arts department is very prestigious and the athletic teams are among the top in their conference.

College Junior,5,"If you decide to live on campus at Friends you will not regret it! Every resident building is with in all walking distances to any buildings you may have class in. All the resident halls I have been in are well kept and clean. The rooms in Smith are a little smaller and most of the sinks in all the kitchens in any of the res halls are too small. If you are willing to get over small sinks, I assure you living on campus will be worth your time.

I really think that living on campus has helped with my positive experience here at Friends. I have made so many friendships with people from all over! Friends is unique with the fact that we have more fine art students than we have athletes, we are a smaller institution which makes for more friendships, and we provide a fun and safe learning environment for all students."

College Senior,5,What is so wonderful is that we have every season.

Junior,4,"I like the people that were around. From the admission office, to the Teachers, to the students and the players. They make it feel like home and very welcoming."
Freshman,4,"Overall good experience.  I am or was living on campus in Freshman Dorm.  Dorm was very nice.  I liked the set up of having three bedrooms with two people per room.  We had a kitchen, living room, and two bathrooms in our suite.  I loved my first room mate.  She did not return for the second semester.  I ended up with a new room mate, because her room mate was mean.  It didn't seem right that the mean room mate got a room to herself, while the nice people have to share a room."
Freshman,4,"It was a good place to start out, but I think the small atmosphere is something that you grow out of very quickly."
Sophomore,4,"I love Friends University! The classes offer flexible schedules, which is essential for student athletes like myself! They are taught my caring staff who personally get to know each student. The campus is beautiful, and the facilities are great!"
Freshman,4,"Friends University is a small and comfortable campus where students are highly encouraged to grow academically, socially, mentally, and spiritually. There are many resources for students to succeed long before they complete their degree, and your advisors especially ensure this. My experience has been very well-rounded, and I believe I have come to know the dynamics of the school fairly well. I have appreciated having an on campus job because it allowed me to interact with my peers and feel even more familiar with my environment. I would love to see more academic options for my degree (psychology), more renovated spaces throughout campus, and exceptionally better food in the cafeteria."
Junior,4,"Friends University is a very tight knit school. Everyone knows everyone, so you are always going to find a helping hand whenever you need it. I have found that if you show the professor that you care about his class and your education, they are more likely to give you advice, more understanding, and often times better scores if you show you truly care."
Freshman,4,I love the small class size. How easy it is to get from one side of campus to the other. And the Friendly environment.

College Junior,4,Depending on which sport you are playing are Athletics are defiantly something worth  looking into! And scholarships are always included!
College Junior,4,Friends University is fantastic! I transferred to this University and have not regretted it. The student body and professors are so friendly and welcoming. I am truly blessed to be receiving my undergraduate at such a spectacular place!
College Senior,4,"What makes my school unique is that it makes it possible for others that can not live on campus, they help organize a program with a college near to home to so that they are available to anyone interested in a certain field. Also, they do not charge the same tuition and fees to those that are outreach students, such as a person like myself."
College Junior,4,"My first year was great, and I even got the chance to do a service project in Cancun, Mexico. This most recent year, the science program has lost a lot of their best professors, which is making it very hard to continue the science degrees. I think Friends as a whole is a good school, but the science program is not currently good."
College Freshman,4,"the dorms are nicer than i thought they would be, they are clean and up to date. the dorms come with anything you need to live."
College Sophomore,4,"Love the program, I wish the academic coach I had the second semester was more helpful.  Otherwise positive experience, just very expensive."

College Freshman,4,"The college coaches here really understand their athletes. They do a great job in recruiting kids from high school. Without the coach here at Friends, I wouldn't be playing the sport I love still."
College Sophomore,4,"Friends University is a great place to go to school. I have made so many memories already and it is only my second year.

College Freshman,4,I didn't know what Braums or Spangles or Ghengis Grill was until I got here! great spots!
College Freshman,4,"Living in the freshman dorms ( green hall) here at Friends, is probably one of the best experiences. The RA's get you involved and can address you by name.   It is a wonderful experience and I encourage any freshman to live in the dorms here!"
College Junior,4,Friends has numerous connection opportunities for some programs.
College Junior,4,"There are many diverse eatery options in downtown wichita. There is a vegan place just down the street that is AMAZING. Pizza is only five minutes away, and is best at 2am in the morning. There is a french restaurant right next to the pizzaria, and it isn't bad. Tex-mex is cheap but good, and there is an incredible smoothie place in near Century 2."
College Junior,4,"Friends is located next to downtown Wichita, so all of the best shopping, cultural, and dining places are within a ten minute drive."
College Junior,4,"Friends study areas are prevalent across campus. There are little lounges everywhere, and every building has some kind of study hall. Curriculum depends on the program, but registration for any program is very easy. There is only one form to sign, and only you and your adviser have to sign it. Special study options are limited, but that also means that your workload is almost guaranteed to be easy."
College Sophomore,4,It's pretty nice until you get on the highways.
College Sophomore,4,Currently a double major student in IT and Business. The classes smooth by.
College Sophomore,4,The parties are great. I can never have a dull weekend.
College Sophomore,4,Have good grades and apply early. The earlier the better

College Junior,4,"I like what they have to offer at the coffee shop, though I've never been to the cafeteria."
College Junior,4,"It is in the middle of a city with many shopping and food options, yet there is still green grass to be seen."
College Junior,4,"It is a college surrounded by a noisy and busy highway, yet they have made a good attempt of creating a calm and pretty environment. Buildings and grounds are kept up nicely."
College Junior,4,I haven't heard of any crime.
College Junior,4,"You get all kinds of weather. If you don't like it, wait awhile...it will change."
College Junior,4,"As far as I know, they are good. I am only in one building so have only seen campus police twice, and that was to inform us of bad weather."
College Freshman,2,it's not bad i guess it's agree.
College Sophomore,2,Never found anyone excited about it.

College Sophomore,2,There isn't much parking around all the buildings and some areas aren't marked off to not park there. Even though it is private property and it only seems right to be able to park where ever if it is not marked off you'll still receive a $15 parking ticket.
Freshman,1,"I came, I saw, lost a couple thousand dollars, learned little, much aggravation with the non-science and fine-arts professors, their online problems that they never solve, and much, much more."
Senior,1,I just wanted to give a review about this university. It was a nightmare on steroids this is all you need to know
Junior,1,The worst experience of my life. Do not come here. Do not come here. It is a waste. Do not come here. Suck...k
Sophomore,1,Bad School. Could not concentrate on homework because of the terrible atmosphere. You have to stick to yourself to survive. There are great resources like counseling to help with the rudeness you get whoever you are on-campus
Freshman,1,"Tried to find out about student government - was waived off. Was told to leave many groups that I joined. Tried to show support of the school by wearing school colors , but was literally made fun of. Can understand the hard time some people can have its a place were people are not used to treating others with respect."
Freshman,1,Would not go here again. The people are insecure. half don't say anything at all and  the ones that do talk about you.
Freshman,1,"School full of bullies..admission staff tries to withdraw you out of classes regularly in the semester would not go here, people seem like they came from schools that emphasized bullying  agree completely"
Freshman,1,"Honestly the girls here a very mean and utterly bully-ish. I have never seen such behavior-so do not read the "" sugarcoat"" reviews on here that's not how it really is. The girls here are like literally unimaginable people. I was bullied, made-fun of and ignored because these people are unimaginablely mean. I was an athlete, cheered at football games, etc. Terrible, immature people. Literally the worst."
College Freshman,1,"we do not have fraternity or sorority. i am no sure why, but all i all is that we do not have them."
College Junior,1,We do not have any fraternities or sororities or greek association in any way.

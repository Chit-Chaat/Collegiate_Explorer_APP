Sophomore,5,"Professors adjusted well and were very understanding. Online classes decreased workload, but I heard it was difficult for those on opposite timezones."
Sophomore,5,"I've loved Wellesley College so far, such a beautiful campus with great academics and friendly, smart students."
Alum,5,"I learned a lot, both in and out of the classroom, which sounds like the biggest cliche. However, I really did make friends that I know I'll have for the rest of my life. Even though my senior year was ruined by COVID, I know that I'll always love Wells. Would highly recommend taking a Calderwood seminar (writing-based seminars). I took two and my favorite was economic journalism with Prof. Dan Sichel. 10/10 would recommend Wellesley."
Alum,5,"I met some amazing friends and really had a nice incubator to become more fully myself. I understand that this is not what everyone needs to get out of college, but I really needed that."
Freshman,5,I love the campus environment and the people. Faculty are perhaps one of the most understanding and passionate college professors out there.
Freshman,5,"As a current first-year at Wellesley, I absolutely love the environment as a whole. The people (the support from some professors and all my peers) and the campus/lake (a beautiful natural setting to help me decompress) were the highlights of my first-year experience."
Junior,5,The educational opportunities and academic environment at Wellesly are superb.  The student body is diverse and supportive.  there are ample research opportunities
Junior,5,"I love the academic rigor of Wellesley, the professors who genuinely care about your well-being and schedule, and the traditions and history that come with being a Wellesley student!"
Freshman,5,"Wellesley college is a very old college, an amazing college. The college seems like a wonderland with old building and trees and we just fall in love with the campus. It is such a diverse college, we get to meet people from all walks of life, smaller class sizes and we get good one on one attention. You feel safe as a woman there. The alumnae network is incredibly helpful and deeply loyal to the school."
Sophomore,5,"I have had the best two years of my life at Wellesley College and I'm excited about what comes in the remaining two as well. It has a great environment that is both encouraging and supportive in every aspect. The size of the school is perfect. I really like the small classrooms and the ability to get to know my professors and classmates well. It also allows for detailed and fruitful discussions during the lectures and seminars. I have been in a class of eight people in my first year! Apart from academic excellence, Wellesley also offers a wide range of clubs and sports where a student can easily find a group of friends like family. I also really like the lush green beautiful campus and Lake Waban."
Alum,5,"Loved most of the people I met there--everyone is very smart in their own way and while that definitely fosters some imposter syndrome, the level of conversation can be as intellectually stimulating as it can be delightfully absurd. However, there seem to be issues re: funding for fixing up dorms, among various social issues voiced by students. I can speak best to the dorms, though. Nothing is *broken*, but the general feeling was making the dorms shiny and new was not a first priority for administration. This is understandable, but it can be dispiriting when ceiling tiles disintegrate in the shower areas, or people get stuck in one certain elevator on a regular basis. 
Great school, great teachers, great peers, but not for everyone."
Niche User,5,"Wellesley has remained my dream school for as long as I can remember. Visiting only confirmed this dream of mine, as I experienced all aspects of the college experience being amongst women who are equally empowered and determined as I am."
Freshman,5,The location is pretty nice since it's somewhat near Boston. People are super friendly and absolutely driven. It's a small school so you will definitely get enough opportunities and all the professors are focused on you and know you as an individual.
Freshman,5,"So far, I love being a student at Wellesley. The range of courses offered is simply astounding, and the faculty members are very understanding and fun to be around. The student body is also very diverse, and you can have an interesting conversation by simply asking someone where they're from!"
Alum,5,Wellesley is a fantastic school. The academics are certainly challenging. But the professors work with you to help ensure your highest level of understanding. The campus is also phenomenally gorgeous.
Alum,5,Absolutely wonderful environment to learn in. I feel as though I have become the person I was meant to be.
Sophomore,5,"Wellesley is a wonderful place to complete an undergraduate education! Not only is the education top-notch, with professional, caring professors, but so is the atmosphere. Students here are truly passionate about what they do, whether it be in academics or extracurricular activities. If you're looking to be surrounded by an awesome group of people while taking fascinating classes, Wellesley is the place for you."
Freshman,5,"Wellesley is an amazing, multi-faceted school. It is 100% what you make of it. The campus is a bit secluded and the course load may be stressful but the community and the sisterhood makes every problem worthwhile."
Alum,5,"Wellesley is an amazing place and as an alum I experience the benefits of having attended every day. Being part of an alumnae/i network that is always available and willing to help us a huge advantage. Not to mention my first two jobs after college had a Wellesley connection. Academically, Wellesley is very difficult and practices grade deflation wherein class averages are supposed to come out to a B+ at the highest. This can make it competitive with your classmates, but it also pushes you to do some really great work. Additionally they have a largest endowment and award need based financial aid generously.  I would absolutely recommend Wellesley to anyone."
Alum,5,Being a student at Wellesley was a great experience. I can not hype up the college enough. Life here can be intense with everyone having a strong opinion and everyone working really hard but I would not have chosen a different college. What I have learned at Wellesley is still very applicable to my life both professional and personal life. My friends from Wellesley are still my closest friends today.
Sophomore,5,The campus was one of the main reasons I chose to attend here. Our professors are the absolute best.
Senior,5,"Students can be in a self-imposed pressure cooker sometimes, but this is a great place to get an education. There are so many opportunities here for everyone. Please consider attending this wonderful institutions."
Freshman,5,"I'm a first-year student and we've been given so many resources to succeed. There's an advisor for absolutely every aspect (first-year life, academic success, faculty mentor, and even major specific advice). There always is someone to fall back on when you struggle"
Alum,5,"Wellesley is just magical. It's an amazing academically rigorous environment (which truth can be told can be brutal at times... very hard work is nonnegotiable)full of driven, intelligent women. The campus is beautiful, and the community is warm and supportive. If you're looking for party-type fun, it's not really the place for that, but if you're looking for a fantastic education, Wellesley is perfect <3."
Senior,5,"I love being a student at Wellesley!  I have made so many friends and connections, both with professors and my peers.  I always feel like I can I be myself, and have seen myself grow into a passionate, confident, intelligent, self-assured woman.  I have been guided in my challenges, and cheered on in my successes.  The community is incredibly supportive and invested in each other."
Sophomore,5,"I am a commuting student, so unfortunately I don't get to experience college in its entirety, but what I do experience is very enriching.  The students have been very friendly, and the professors are brilliant in their field of study. There are so many things to do on campus. There is a club for just about every interest. This is not a ""party school"" which some people may find disappointing, but that's why I prefer it.  Overall, my favorite part about Wellesley is the countless nooks and crannies for one to study in."
Freshman,5,"Wellesley is the best thing to ever happen to me. I feel unbelievably blessed to have been placed in this picture-perfect setting with passionate faculty, brilliant and kind students, a convenient location, incredible facilities,  and caring staff. No college is perfect, but Wellesley tends to acknowledge its imperfections and actively works to resolve them. I've never felt more supported, appreciated, or stimulated intellectually. Wellesley is for you if you're an overachiever, if you value being part of a historic legacy, and if you care about what you do. Wellesley is not for you if all you care about is partying(though it's still available), social status, greek life, or slacking off. I love my community-- Wellesley feels like home."
Freshman,5,"Wellesley college is a great community full of bright, ambitious and conscientious students. Everyone is extremely helpful and understanding, including faculty and the student body. The academics is rigorous and allows students to explore in detail new areas of study."
Senior,5,"I transferred to Wellesley after doing my first year at a large public university. I came here for the tight-knit community of inspiring women, more contact with professors, and (of course) the beautiful campus. My experience here has been incredible. Not only are the classes challenging and engaging, but the level of discourse among the students here always amazes me."
Junior,5,"If you're the type of student who is willing to take initiative and connect with other women, you will go far with a Wellesley education. A few notable features of the college include their Career Education services, the powerful alumnae network, and the professors' dedication to teaching undergraduates."
Sophomore,5,I love being around other smart people who are respectful and love to learn. The campus is beautiful.
Senior,5,"Campus is beautiful. Academics and ability to make connections are amazing. However, sometimes there isn't a social life, and some students here can be anti-fun. Wellesley is slowly getting better about listening to students' of color concerns."
Alum,5,"Great place. Incredible academics, brilliant community. Intellectual curiosity abounds. Women from all different walks of life who are engaged and committed. Everyone is incredibly hard-working and goal-oriented. The rowing team is especially successful. There is a niche for everyone on the school's beautiful campus. No place like it."
Alum,5,Very welcoming female student environment. I enjoyed the freedom to be myself and develop into the woman I am today. I wish the school had remained woman only college forever.
Junior,5,"Wellesley is the most beautiful campus I've ever seen-it's covered in flowers during the summer and looks like a winter postcard in the winter. The community is supportive and open, the alumni care, and there's always some sort of event going on. It's the sort of campus where you feel safe any time of day and know if you have a problem there will always be someone there to help. The local area is a little boring, and the athletics department could definitely have more variety, but the dorms are nice and the environments amazing. The professors really, truly want the students to succeed and will do everything they can to ensure you do. At the same time, I'm finally someplace where I have to study to get good grades and people talk about what is going on in the world rather than who is dating who. In a word, for me this campus is ""Heaven""."
Freshman,5,Wellelsey College is one of the best schools where any motivated student is able to reach their full potential and be helped by some of the most talented professors and fellow students. It Is truly a special place where an individual is able to explore their passions and learn some impressive lessons along the way.
Sophomore,5,"I love Wellesley and all of the passionate students who come here, they are all going to make their mark on the world in their respective fields. I chose Wellesley because it is academically challenging, has amazing opportunities for internships, and the sense of sisterhood(and the amazing alum network that comes with it)."
Freshman,5,"I love the community and the support at Wellesley. From the moment I set foot on Campus, I felt to natural to be in this community. I am currently a freshman but I think Wellesley is growing to be my home. Food is amazing and since we have five dining halls, we can choose to go anywhere. The campus is stunning and is such a safe place to walk around even at like 2 in the morning. The professors are all passionate and willing to give the most in every class. The work load is not small but manageable. They are setting us up for success!"
College Freshman,5,Alumni network is very very strong and many internship or job opportunities are shared easily throughout campus. Also this school has a huge reputation so i feel confident about getting a job following my graduation.
College Freshman,5,"Professors are so passionate and intelligent that I have a lot of respect for them. The courses are not very varied but all of them are rigorous and inspiring. The class sizes are perfect for students to actively engage in, which is a big part of learning in my opinion."
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. There's always a variety of staff who care about the students' well being in all kinds of ways. I feel very supportive by many services provided by the school.
College Freshman,5,This school is very supportive of its students. It's heavily student-oriented and wants the best for its students. Small classes work better because professors can get to know students better and these relationships lead to healthy class environment.
College Student,5,I feel extremely safe on campus. All of the paths are very well lit and crime is not common.
College Student,5,"The professors here are excellent. From the moment you step into their rooms, they are extremely welcoming and willing to help you."
Recent Alumnus,5,"When people hear the Wellesley name, there is recognition.  I've held many wonderful internships and have landed a great job for after graduation."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I have loved every professor I've had at Wellesley, without exception. They are devoted, brilliant, and incredibly attentive to the student body.  Think of it this way: They could have chosen to teach at a large university where TAs do a ton of the grading and grunt work, but they chose to come to Wellesley where their day-to-day workload and interactions with students is so much higher."
Recent Alumnus,5,"We leave our doors unlocked, usually. It's that safe."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I lived in Tower Hall in a wonderful room that overlooked the lake. Our RA held many really cute events, and I felt very close to my neighbors."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The best professors, the most beautiful campus, and like-minded overachievers. I loved it here."
College Freshman,5,"I actually really enjoy the way the party scene is kept distinct from 'campus life' - if you want, you can turn up all weekend in Boston, but if you want a quiet weekend in it's very easy."
College Freshman,5,"There's a pretty significant but largely manageable workload. Don't take more than one lab your first semester, and don't try to 'challenge yourself' with more than four classes before you know you can handle it."
College Freshman,5,"Wellesley is amazing with regards to sex/gender/sexual orientation diversity, and is making strides in other areas. Islamophobia remains a commonly cited problem with campus culture, but while a problem, the perpetrators are a small but vocal and largely anonymous minority."
College Freshman,5,"Wellesley is a very safe place with regards to alcohol use - there is alcohol, but it's not easy to obtain, and no one will judge you negatively if you don't go that direction."
College Freshman,5,"CWS is amazing with regards to internships - sometimes it can be slow to get info back, but overall they are extremely helpful. I know there are some complaints about grade deflation, but a 3.0 at Wellesley is worth a 3.5 at a state school in terms of the opportunities it opens up."
College Freshman,5,"I have met amazing professors and learned just as much in their classes from the students - everyone here is just so incredibly smart, and has such interesting stories to tell!"
College Freshman,5,"I lived in Dower House, and honestly I had the most amazing experience as a first year! We don't get a lot of love from the community at large, but there's an abundance of friendship and support no matter what part of the campus you're housed in!"
College Freshman,5,I actually really love that we don't have a greek life on campus - there are lots of alternatives for that sort of scene off-campus.
College Freshman,5,"I adore the volleyball team and have been to most games! There's not an ENORMOUS turn out, but there are always students ready to support their friends and siblings."
College Freshman,5,I have literally never been happier than I am here.
College Freshman,5,Small class sizes are great. Professors and staff genuinely seem to care about you. So far I feel very supported.
Freshman,4,Feels like you are really connecting with the teachers and they are always willing to help you! They are extremely understanding and caring!
Freshman,4,"It has a nice close-knit community, that provides a lot of support!There are always resources available to students!"
Freshman,4,"Professors tried hard to make the situation more adaptable, but online learning will never do in class learning justice. But the transition was very accommodating to many situations."
Graduate Student,4,"While I was ambivalent about the social life on campus, I cannot be happier about the education I received from distinguished professors incredibly passionate about their field, and the countless opportunities I was given throughout my four years at Wellesley. Wellesley allowed me to explore my interests, supported my research and study abroad pursuits, and I continue to have strong ties to my professors 2 years after graduation. I would recommend Wellesley College to any student who is serious about academics and would like to join the ranks of driven, passionate alumna in the Wellesley network who want to make a positive difference in the world."
Sophomore,4,Wellesley College is amazing for individualized attention and access to professors. The social life on campus is a little lacking though since we are so far away from Boston (the closest major city).
Niche User,4,"My experience with Wellesley was through an alumnae weekend. My mother attended Wellesley, so I had a great time touring the campus with her, meeting her college friends, and participating in the weekend's events. I also ended up applying to Wellesley because of the great weekend experience I had there. Since  I didn't stay for long, I don't have any qualms about the college - there's nothing I would change. I especially liked that some of the dorms had dining halls in them, since I love eating and appreciate the convenience it provides."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Wellesley college was very eye-opening, I met many people and learned how to make long-lasting connections. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. The professors push their students and bring out the best in them. Wellesley college is great academically but I  think that socially it needs some work.  The school promotes a culture that is very stressful and made me feel like I was doing something wrong whenever I wasn't stressed. As far as minorities go, the school has a whole fails to include others in large events. As an African American I often felt awkward at social events, it felt like they only made Caucasians comfortable"
Niche User,4,"Wellesley is a thriving college that empowers America's women for the future! My only concern is that the mascot of this college is the ""blue"". Not sure how to depict this mascot, maybe consider changing it..."
Junior,4,"Financial AId is great. There are multiple cafeterias. There are newer dorms that are very spacious, but the older dorms are single rooms stuffed with 2 beds to create doubles."
Freshman,4,"Wellesley is a campus full of driven women determined to succeed and make a difference in the world. There are no gen-ed requirements, meaning all classes are small and filled with students from all years. The student body in general is very liberal (it is a women's college in a blue state) and some students complain that they don't feel comfortable voicing their conservative opinions, although the population tends to be accepting of diversity. Administration is working on the current lack of social life on campus, a minor complaint from students who can take a bus to Boston to have fun."
Alum,4,I had a great time at this college. I majored in Biochemistry and was able to participate in several research projects during my time here.
Niche User,4,"I took a tour and spent a night on campus was taken good care of by the admissions staff and all students. They love ""prospies"" or prospective students and did their best to portray an accurate sense of the school"
Sophomore,4,"Challenging environment, but worth it. A bit tedious to go into Boston can make social life a bit isolating. Amazing professors."
College Freshman,4,"The resident community is very supportive and strong. Some dorms are very old, so many of them are not so clean to live in. I wish there were more housing products given in the dorms like paper towels and more often cleaning for the bathrooms."
College Freshman,4,"The school is a Division III school, so sports aren't too competitive. However, the sports facilities are new and nice for both athletes and non-athletes. The school also wants you to find a balance between academics and self-care to make sure students get enough exercise."
Sophomore,4,"While world-class faculty can be found at any top institution, the expectations of the professors and the self-imposed high standard of achievement among students makes Wellesley intensely and exceptionally challenging. Thus, it's easy think of Wellesley as Hell(esley), but there is a reason why students affectionately refer to their home as Swellesley. Students take pride in how difficult their school is: they don't want an easy degree sending them into a demanding world. Often alumnae credit the academic challenges they faced at Wellesley as fundamental preparation for the challenges they faced in their often accomplished careers. Wellesley's motto is sed ministrare non ministrari, not to be ministered unto but to minister to. Wellesley is not where girls become women, but where women become leaders. Certainly, there is no room for slackers at the top college, but there is also no limit on the achievement of the ambitious, intelligent, and lauded women who continue to attend."
College Student,4,The Center for Work and Service is a great resource for students and allows students to have personalized premed advisers. The alumni network is extremely strong and their are many opportunities for research on campus.
College Student,4,"The classes are extremely engaging and there are a wide variety of classes to choose from. The professors know what they are doing and seem to want to help every student. Class sizes are small, so all students have equal opportunities."
College Student,4,There are many opportunities for students to participate in sports on campus. The equipment and facilities are well kept.
College Freshman,4,Both parties (frat or otherwise) and clubs/dance halls are pretty easy to get to if you're willing to spend an hour on the Senate Bus.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't always had the best experiences with Health Services, but I don't like working with doctors and they make the process as painless as possible. Make sure you ask how much tests cost before you agree to them!"
College Sophomore,4,"Wellesley is amazing -- the women are so empowered. I have never been amongst a crowd that had such a passion to learn and grow from each other, while still having fun. Wellesley is the place where you will meet friends with whom you can do crosswords and have slumber parties one night, and a discussion about the 7th dimension the next. Don't believe me? Come visit us, and you'll fall for it, I promise."
College Freshman,4,The feeling of independence and strength that I feel whenever I am on campus is so incredibly refreshing. I feel empowered. I walk around campus with a purpose. I know I have a purpose and that my school is going to help me carry out my goals.
College Sophomore,4,The only hard part about getting into the neuroscience major was really just registration. Neuroscience courses are very popular.
College Sophomore,4,"The neuroscience program is established and well supported, with many well known professors in the department. The curriculum is slightly too open in my opinion; it does not really compare with other colleges in that it doesn't include some very important and common requirements. Most neuroscience students are premed/"
College Sophomore,4,The campus is very beautiful.
College Sophomore,4,"The alumni network is great, and everything I've heard suggests that Wellesley has good recognition among graduate schools and employers. There is a career fair every year."
College Sophomore,4,"The food is fine, not AMAZING but certainly edible, and you'll find all the food groups you need. You never have to worry about budgeting your meals. The main downside is that there are very few gluten free options."
College Sophomore,4,"I've heard horror stories about the aid decreasing after the first year, but my first year financial aid package was very good and the highest out of any schools I applied to. If you don't get the package you need, APPEAL LIKE CRAZY."
College Freshman,4,"Off campus it is great, on campus it is relatively quiet"
College Freshman,4,"Like the food a lot, find many options for anyone."
College Freshman,4,I haven't had an internship yet. But I heard they are pretty great. The CWS office helps students with their resume and prepare them for the future career.
College Freshman,4,Generally you will feel really safe on campus. Sometimes there could be theft.
College Freshman,4,Things are pretty strict here in general. But that's why it is safe and comfortable for everyone.
College Freshman,4,All first year students are requited to live on campus. People are all very nice and helpful here.
College Freshman,4,Generally lenient as long as you don't hurt yourself.
College Freshman,4,"Wellesley's cute, and Boston's easy to get to."
College Freshman,4,"Academics are much more important than sports. We don't even have a school mascot. However, for those students who are interested in athletics, I think the facilities are sufficient."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not part of the Greek Life, but the people I know in sororities are great people and I might have joined if I had the time."
College Sophomore,4,"The nearby town has great food that's too expensive for most college students. However, a 40 minute bus ride takes us into Boston and Cambridge which have fantastic restaurants, cafes, and diners."
College Sophomore,4,"I have not yet declared my major, but there is no process for getting into the program. As long as I complete my required courses before graduation, I have completed the program."
College Sophomore,4,"I do plan on having an internship. Many of my older friends have had interships and speak nothing but good words about them. I do have concerns about finding internships as the field of applicants is very competitive. One professional training position I have held is at Amica Mutual Insurance, working in the First Notice of Loss department taking claims reports. I gained valuable office work experience and learned how to professionally interact with customers, co workers, and superiors."
College Sophomore,4,"Wellesley is a thriving, family oriented community."
College Senior,4,"I really love the campus housing. The buildings are beautiful. My building has awesome custodial staff, but I've also experienced probably the worst."
College Senior,4,"The Stone Center and Health Services are severely lacking. I don't always feel that I'm receiving adequate support when/if I need to visit. 

Campus po is okay. There isn't much to address at Wellesley (it's extremely safe), but they are available if you need anything."
College Sophomore,4,"The outer aesthetic of the campus in general is beautiful and breathtaking.  However, some of the buildings are very old and are in need of repair"
College Sophomore,4,"Wellesley's policies allow students to have enough freedom to do most of the things they would like to. Wellesley is very good at drawing strict lines when activities impede upon the safety of students and faculty. Basically, Wellesley will let its students have all of the freedom they need to create new organizations, events, or to simply enjoy themselves but will stop any illegal and dangerous behaviors quickly and authoritatively."
College Sophomore,4,Workload is a lot and the academic environment can be very stressful. Professors are very attentive and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,Living rooms and outdoor aesthetics are beautiful. The rooms can often be small though. Shower areas could be cleaner.
College Sophomore,4,"Unlimited dining at any dining hall. Buffet style. Lots of variety, though they don't always get the ethnic foods quite right."
College Sophomore,4,Professors are always super helpful. Sometimes it's hard to balance all the work you're given but you definitely learn a lot no matter what.
College Sophomore,4,"There are an abundance of neuroscience majors, so the neuroscience department is quite big and also a lot of fun. Professors are always willing to meet with you and provide extra help through tutoring sessions."
College Sophomore,4,"We rely heavily upon the honor code here. Violating it can have severe consequences, including meeting with the honor code council."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a women's college, which seems difficult to get used to at first but is actually really great. There's something about an all-women liberal arts college that allows the education and student life to be very eye-opening. You'll definitely learn a lot about things you've never considered."
College Sophomore,4,"There are enough events happening on campus that can cater to everyone. Usually, it's not necessary to go off campus to engage in fun activities. Traditions are well-kept."
College Sophomore,4,"Each dorm has its own perks but also downfalls. For example, some dorms are really spacious, but far from many of the academic buildings. Other dorms are closer to more of the buildings, but have somewhat smaller rooms. Usually everyone ends up liking where they live regardless of whether or not it was their first choice, though."
College Freshman,4,"It's great if you are interested in dating girls. There are tons of girls who date girls, and there's a wide range of looks and interests among these girls. If you are a straight girl, it's way, way harder."
College Freshman,4,"It is pretty diverse but there are still a lot of rich, white, straight people. There are definitely a lot of non-straight, non-cisgender people. That is probably the strongest community."
College Freshman,4,Nearly everybody is on an open meal plan. It's great because you don't have to worry about only taking a certain amount of food. You can take as much food as you want. The menus are uneven. There is usually always something decent though.
College Freshman,4,"My school is not really strict and lets the students do their own thing for the most part. Dorm life is very lax, and part of this is because students tend to not get very crazy. So there's not that much monitoring."
Sophomore,2,"Wellesley College, although sporting great academics, is a terrible environment for sensitive, collaborative students. Wellesley students rarely work together and are extremely competitive, partly due to the (recently repealed) grade deflation policy. Beautiful campus, great teachers for the most part, but terrible classmates. Stay away if you want a school where you'll feel supported and motivated by your peers."
College Freshman,2,I would not want my child to go here.
College Sophomore,2,I didn't make any friends and I had bad experiences with supposedly great professors. I felt like many of my peers AND professors were only concerned with things like rankings and their reputation. I knew people who lost friends over exam scores. I got very depressed and isolated. I really regret choosing Wellesley.
College Sophomore,2,"I had a bad year. My professors usually gave me the same grade every assignment, did not give me a lot of feedback on my work, and didn't seem to expect me to improve. I was always beating myself up because I wasn't doing very well academically, and so was everyone else, so everyone's negative feelings were feeding off of each other. I don't feel like a learned a lot, and now I have anxiety around school that I didn't used to have.

My major had a strong program, but the electives I actually wanted to take were limited. Class sizes were small, which was good."
College Sophomore,2,It's just boring. There is a nice bookstore and some expensive clothing stores and boutiques. Wellesley is a very wealthy town.
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have greek life, we have societies. Some people are obsessed with getting into a society, but most seem to look down on the whole idea. It's an endless source of low key drama. Most societies advertise themselves as having a specific academic theme (like Classics), but it doesn't sound like they are really involved with their theme and mostly get together to party."
College Sophomore,2,"I've heard there isn't much support for athletes, who often have to miss class and penalized for it, and nobody really cares about sports here besides athletes."
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone mostly gets drunk in Boston and then they have to find their way back to campus, which is a 40 minute shuttle ride at least. (As you can imagine, said shuttle is absolutely disgusting.) I haven't gone to any off campus parties. It's just too inconvenient and sounds a bit dangerous to be honest."
College Sophomore,2,"On campus, it's pretty bad. But off campus, it's awesome!!! We have Boston!"
College Freshman,2,The houses in Wellesley town are really expensive.
College Freshman,2,Health Services and Stone Center are understaffed.
College Freshman,2,The town is too expensive to live off campus.
College Freshman,2,Think of a college party... now Wellesley does not have that... at all. The campus parties are not very fun unless you are really drunk. Parties off campus are best. Harvard and MIT are the most convenient and tend to be really fun. Tons of free alcohol
College Sophomore,2,"I got a lot of financial aid my first year, but they're not providing as much aid this year and my appeal went nowhere."
College Sophomore,2,I know three upperclassmen who live off-campus. The off-campus housing selection is too expensive and too far for most people to live there.
College Senior,2,The dining options are repetitive and you get tired of the offerings very quick. I also don't think they pay much attention to cleaning a lot of the vegetables. My friend once found a caterpillar in some greens cooked in Tower.
College Senior,2,"I think many try to paint Wellesley as an incredibly diverse place, but it's not. There is little political diversity and the racial/ethnic diversity is laughable. I will preface that last bit by saying Asian students at Wellesley are well represented, but that is it. There is little Latin@ or black representation at Wellesley. I believe the percentages are 7 and 6 percent respectively. There is a diverse representation of sexual orientation. Although I am straight, if I identified as LGBTQ I feel that I would be very accepted and comfortable at Wellesley."
College Sophomore,2,You almost always have to go off campus to party. It's what you make of it.
College Freshman,2,There are basically no parties on campus. But there is easy access to a lot of parties off campus. You have to get on the bus though.
College Freshman,2,"Most of the year, it's very cold and brutal. There is some sun at the beginning and some at the end, but it's really pretty sucky. Most of the time it's harsh outside and you have to wear a ton of layers."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are no Greek chapters at Wellesley College. Students do get inducted into the local Boston chapters, but that's it. Instead of sororities, Wellesley has four societies, and each one has its own house. These houses are used for their events and parties. All members of societies live in the dorms. The societies also have rules and ""tea"" periods, during which students interested in joining must do something well to be inducted into the society."
College Freshman,2,"No one really cares too much about athletics, but they are perfectly adequate."
College Freshman,2,"No one really cares. I think our teams are all decent, but most students are way too focused on other stuff to care too much about athletics. Our athletic facilities are really old. The school is starting to renovate them, but it won't be a while until everything is new and fixed."
College Freshman,2,"Parties on campus are pretty bad. The Asian orgs throw parties but they're all attended by asians or weird, creepy, very desperate guys from nearby schools. Most people go off campus, but that is just a struggle with the bus and everything. Also Wellesley is a completely dry-town, as in the supermarkets don't even sell beer. Boston is also very strict with the IDs, so you'd have to get someone who's over 21 to buy you drinks. Partying is just such a struggle."
College Freshman,2,"We have a pretty good Thai place nearby (Amarin). Then for late-night you can order Domino's. We have a few coffee shops and some other random, overpriced restaurants, but if you really want variety, you'd have to take the bus to Boston/Cambridge."
College Freshman,2,"The off campus food is either over priced or cheap. The food is nothing to rave about what-so-ever, which is sad especially since the school is located in such a rich town. People would expect good restaurants with good food. "
College Junior,2,Wellesley is such a small town that you have to go into Boston to get more variety. That being said Lemon Thai and Qdoba are some good choices within walking distance. Lemon Thai delivers and so does Dominos.
College Sophomore,2,"Most people live on campus for all 4 years. You can apply to live in French House which is just off campus, but looking for a place in the Ville is impractical and extremely expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"Wellesley is a dry town and everything basically closes by 9 pm. That being said, Boston is a 40-minute bus ride away (better for weekends than for weekdays) and has a wonderful college town atmosphere."
College Freshman,2,"In my first year, the state has declared a state of emergency due to weather twice. 

I'm from California so I'm biased, but when I first got here it was so humid and then it started raining but the humidity didn't go away, so you were constantly hot and sticky. Fall is gorgeous, but winter quickly comes and it's freezing. The first snow looks like Narnia or something, but after the second blizzard you're tired of it."
College Senior,2,"False Advertising – Wellesley says that they meet 100% of students' need and are dedicated to small debts for students, but I have consistently had trouble paying for college. Though I do receive money from the college, I feel that they weigh certain factors (like parents' income before taxes) more heavily than others (like living cost of certain areas and high income/property taxes), which means my parents are going broke and I try to work as much as possible while still maintaining my grades in order to pay for my college. I try to ask for more grants every year, but the Fin Ain office only offers more loans as a solution.  If I didn't love the school so much, I would have chosen a much cheaper state school."
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid for Wellesley is based solely on need.  So in return there isn't a whole lot of help with finding scholarships outside of the college and merits scholarships aren't offered from the college.  The Office of International Studies is very helpful in finding scholarships for study abroad outside of the Wellesley College.
College Sophomore,2,"Occassionally there are parties or other events, but if you are into partying, its a much popular option to take the senate bus and get off campus.  Due to Wellesley's close proximity to other schools and their nightlife, the campus tends to quiet down about ten on an average school night."
College Freshman,2,"So, before finals there's a party on campus every week or every other week. Generally, you go with your gal pals or the creepers come. They can be fun, but be warned that security isn't as good as you'd like. There's also the Pub which has a dance party every Thursday from 10-2. You can go into Boston, as well, but it might be a hassle."
Recent Alumnus,2,The Ville – the town of wellesley is extremely expensive.  no one goes there though - take the free bus to boston.  boston is great.
College Senior,2,"Most students are required to park in a lot that is pretty much off campus, and it's a real hassle to go get your car. It can add about 30+ minutes onto your car trip time, so going off campus is something you really need to plan for. But, if you are a junior or senior, you can enter a lottery to park in a lot on the other side of campus which is more accessible for East Side residents."
College Junior,2,"Not a Big Deal – While there are plenty of athletes on campus, the athletic facilities are sub par (no air conditioning, old/outdated equipment).  There's not too much school spirit, either, though there has been a push for more game attendance in the past."
College Sophomore,2,"Off Campus Is Better – Nightlife is pretty dead at Wellesley during the week. On the weekends an organization usually hosts a party and it can either be a hit or miss. The plus is that Wellesley students are free at Wellesley parties. There's a pub on campus but you can only drink if you are 21+, the town is a dry town. Most girls leave campus on the peter pan shuttle and go to MIT, Harvard, BU, BC, Tufts, Northeastern, and other Boston colleges to have fun."
College Sophomore,2,"For Fun – Wellesley is D3 in sports. We are known for more than athletics although our Crew team is actually exceptionally. There are plenty of sports to get involved in and the girls that participate are passionate. Not a lot of school spirit, but we support."
College Junior,2,"I'm not a fan of the dining halls, and I am sick of having to eat crappy AVI fresh food. Dining hall hours are limited, and it makes no fiscal sense. As an athlete, I eat more than my other friends, but I don't have to pay more. The hours are also very limited, and you cannot get off the meal plan. The benefits are that they have a kosher dining hall, lots of vegetarian food, and the convenience of not having to cook for yourself. As much as students complain, 90% would stay on the meal plan even if they could get off of it."
Alum,1,"It took me several years to heal from my experience at Wellesley. Looking back, the campus culture was extremely toxic. It wasn't just the ""Wendy Wellesley,"" overachieving mentality. But rather, it was the woman-on-woman cruelty that made college life harder than it needed to be. Bullying was often politically motivated, although I can name plenty of campus-wide incidents that didn't fall into that category. Bullying wasn't a small-scale event, either. I saw women humiliated by hundreds of their peers, who either actively proliferated rumors about them or remained silent as it happened. Don't expect the faculty to help you, either. Wellesley College is a perfect example of call-out culture gone too far."
Sophomore,1,"Wellesley is at best a mediocre college. I have never been treated with such disrespect. When I hung up posters for an event questioning single payer, 20-30 were torn down and six saying, ""eat shit bigot"" were placed over the remaining posters.

Some students here are the most selfish, narcissistic, entitled women I have ever met. They believe they can speak for minorities even though some minorities outside the Wellesley bubble have different opinions from them. And some just talk about how great they are. I have great respect for my undergraduate and graduate friends at MIT because they are smart, but they are way more humble than some Wellesley students. 

I've had former friends ignore me over subjects we disagree on and classmates who thought independently become 'Wellesleyfied.' 

If you're looking for a college which encourages creative thinking, this is not the place."
College Sophomore,1,Almost no one lives off campus. The only person I know who does has a medical reason.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no place to rent around Wellesley! It's extremely expensive and if you manage to find a place, it'll be far from campus. Better off living in Boston and making the commute (if you're a senior with 1 or 2 Wellesley classes)."
College Sophomore,1,99% of students live on campus. I don't even know anyone who lives off campus.
College Senior,1,I have been verbally assaulted on numerous occasions by residents of Wellesley and this makes me feel incredibly unsafe. I no longer go into the Ville alone. I think residents are generally unfriendly and not accepting of Wellesley students.
College Sophomore,1,Everyone mostly lives on campus
College Freshman,1,"There is literally no fast food besides the food at the convenience store and Dunkin Donuts. All the restaurants nearby are very nice but way too expensive. And there is no food open late, which is terrible."
College Freshman,1,"The food is disgusting. Many people love the food, but I come from a home where we eat healthy and we use a lot of delicious spices. So eating the bland, sometimes questionable food that is served is puke worthy. Most of the time I have to resort to eating a bagel, bread, rice, ice cream, salad (MOST of the time I have to eat this, even when I am sick of it!) or whatever else I know for sure will taste normal. "
College Senior,1,the food has deteriorated at a rapid pace over the last few years.
College Senior,1,"There are two places open late at night but Wellesley is a very high stress and high intensity place so ""nightlife"" isn't really a big thing."
College Junior,1,"The town is geared towards its wealthy population. There's really nothing for students to do there except get ice cream, go to CVS, and window shop. The stores are ridiculously overpriced. It's not a fun college town- you'd be better off going into Boston to have fun. But be aware that Boston in farther away than admissions likes you to think. It's a 45 min (minimum) bus ride."
College Junior,1,"There is quite frankly no such thing as off-campus housing. The town of Wellesley is very much catered (in all aspects including night life) to its extremely wealthy population. There is no such thing as affordable off-campus housing. However, some students will live in Boston, which is a very big hassle considering Wellesley in +45 minutes away from Boston. Usually students who do such, however, do so because they are not fond of their experience at Wellesley and hope that living in Boston will make them happier. Don't be fooled by the brochure and campus tour guides. You will not be popping into Boston unless you really have some time on your hands."
College Junior,1,"Dorms or Nothing – 99% live on campus end of story.  You're trapped in the dorms.  Some brave, rich souls adventure off campus, but the rest of us, stuck."
College Sophomore,1,No Night Life Unless You Leave Campus – The nerds are always hitting the books.  Not even the nerds but everyone is always studying.  PLEASE be a cool person leave campus for a night and hit up the frats or bars in Boston.  Nothing in the town of Wellesley as far as night life.  Few on campus parties.
College Senior,1,"It seems that our campus po don't have anything better to do than bust parties. Our dorms are generally clean and quiet, and neighbors will often call po on each other before asking the girl next door to turn down the music/voices. Its frustrating."
College Junior,1,"It's Easier to Take the Bus – Parking sucks -- only seniors get to park in the ""good"" parking lot, which can still be a ten minute walk from dorms. Sophomores and juniors have to park in the farthest lot, at least a ten minute walk but up to twenty if you're in the new dorms. It's easier to walk to the Ville than to a car."
College Senior,1,"No One Cares – There is a very small sense of athletic pride on campus and most of the people who are proud of the athletic programs at Wellesley are athletes.  It is sad because most of the non-athlete students have no idea the time, effort and dedication it takes to be on an athletic team.  Also, I am pretty sure not everyone knows where the athletic fields/complex are."
College Sophomore,1,"No One Lives Off Campus – Housing is guaranteed for every student, all four years of college.  Therefore, not many people live off-campus.  Transportation around the town of Wellesley isn't great unless you have a car.  Plus, Wellesley is ridiculously expensive."
College Junior,1,"There is little off campus housing, and most students choose to live on campus. 1-2 students every year lives at the Natick Organic Farm, which requires 15 hours a week of work in exchange for housing. The housing near Wellesley has low availability, high cost, and low convenience. On campus housing is a great opportunity though, you just roll out of bed to class."

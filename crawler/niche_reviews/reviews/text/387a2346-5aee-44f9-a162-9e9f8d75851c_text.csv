Freshman,5,I love Colgate's academics. The campus is so pretty in the fall and it is easy to walk places. Very safe.
Alum,5,"I loved Colgate, everything except the weather.  Had a great blend between top tier academics with small class sizes and a highly active social scene not present on many similar liberal arts colleges."
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online, I have no idea why this is forcing me to use 100 characters to say that"
Alum,5,I really enjoyed my time at Colgate! I have had so many positive memories and experiences. It provided me with amazing educational and professional opportunities.
Alum,5,"Colgate is a beautiful campus and it is a tight knit community. Most students care about their peers. The faculty truly care about the students,."
Sophomore,5,"Colgate is the greatest place on earth. It has amazing academics, a terrific Greek scene that is still thriving, and a unique culture shared by students and alums alike. The camaraderie of drinking the cold, upstate winters away has developed a powerful alumni network which can be leveraged by socially inclined students. The only negative is the administration, which can be suffocating to Greek life at times."
Freshman,5,work hard play harder school with a beautiful campus friendly people. the professors are so kind and caring. beautiful places to study and hang out
Niche User,5,I visited Colgate University and had a great experience. The campus was beautiful and I can't wait to live there in the fall.
Freshman,5,"Great environment for learning, wonderful faculty. Party culture tends to influence freshman strongly, but a good sense of self will prevent this way of life from hindering on academics."
Junior,5,"Excellent academics, athletics, class size small and plenty of opportunity to engage with professors."
Niche User,5,"Colgate University has an excellent campus and learning environment.  The dorms are very comfortable and in an excellent town. It was definitely my favorite campus that I have ever visited.  The academics focus on small groups and classes so that you have personalized learning, which I really appreciate."
Freshman,5,"Colgate University is an amazing environment with exceptional academics, a beautiful campus, incredible faculty and students, many opportunities for involvement, and overall is a really fun and enjoyable atmosphere!"
Senior,5,Absolutely love my experience at Colgate! The community on campus is amazing and follows you when you graduate by an incredibly strong alumni network.
Freshman,5,"Colgate is the perfect school for me. The academics are challenging but the atmosphere is not competitive. The athletics are amazing for a small, academically focused university. The campus is beautiful. It’s in the middle of nowhere but it’s beautiful, I could walk around the campus for hours. Social life is fun, kids work hard and party harder. Only this is that it sucks for a freshman guy. Like REALLY sucks unless you join an early organization or are on a team or are just an alpha dude who has connections. Still love school though."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love the community at Colgate University. Furthermore, I'm excited about all the academic opportunities I have, especially in terms of study abroad as well as exploration because only 4 classes are required for the core curriculum."
Sophomore,5,"Colgate is the best place on earth. I am a second semester sophomore and already stressing about now having enough time left on this campus. The Colgate community is so real everyone genuinely wants to be friends with everyone regardless of grade, gender, etc.. Not to mention it is home to quite possibly the best people on earth, it is so encouraged for people to be themselves and embrace their quirks. I had no idea what I was doing applying to schools but I am so lucky I ended up here, especially comparing it to others peoples experiences, it is genuinely so happy here always :)"
Alum,5,"My four years at Colgate University were some of the best and most formative years of my life. The campus is small enough to feel intimate, but large enough that you are constantly meeting new people. The academic structure is designed to allow exploration in interesting subjects while also providing in-depth knowledge in your chosen field. The professors are passionate about both their subjects and students, and many students graduate having formed lasting relationships with their professors. There is a lot of school pride and alums really go out of their way to provide opportunities to students. It snows most of the school year so it is wise to invest in a good coat and snow boots, but with or without snow it is one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. Attending Colgate was one of the best decisions I have ever made."
Alum,5,Campus is beautiful. Academics are excellent since class size is small with professors being outstanding. I graduated when Colgate was all male which caused students to be focused on academics. Party weekends started on Thursday and ended Monday and there were a total of four during the school year.  Football and track were excellent.
Sophomore,5,"Colgate is isolated, though it makes up a wonderful community as a small liberal arts university. The campus is gorgeous, the services it provides are top notch and the academic experience is among the best in the world."
Senior,5,"Colgate has changed my life. I grew up with a single parent who made minimum wage, so going to college was never a guarantee. Colgate helped me every step of the way. They aren't need blind, but they do meet full demonstrated need. I have traveled to over 15 countries, had three summer internships (fully funded by Colgate), and met with world leaders. Colgate is an incredible place, especially if you take advantage of it. Go to office hours. I went for advice on a paper and one of my professors made some calls to help me get me my dream job. Alumni will go out of their way to help you (seriously. I have a colgate sticker on my car and people will leave their business cards on my windshield in case I want to meet with them)."
Sophomore,5,"Colgate University is a major liberal arts university located in Hamilton, NY. It prides itself on giving its students an interdisciplinary education. On the whole, the professors at Colgate are fantastic and its resources are immense."
Senior,5,"I enjoyed attending Colgate very much. The Alumni network is probably the largest investment return for the school. The reputation as a party school is changing with recent protests motivating safer and more conscientious greek life. The town is very small and rural with almost no resources, however, this makes road trips to cities quite fun. Similarly, the small town, harsh winters, challenging academics, and small class sizes makes the Colgate community very close."
Freshman,5,"Being a school on the smaller side has its pros and its cons. It means there is a large sense of community, and after just one semester you'll keep bumping into people you know no matter where you go. There is a bit of a party scene, but truth is that you can get whatever you want from the school if you find the right group of people to hang out with, regardless of your tastes."
Niche User,5,"I like way of teaching academic learning skills, and the place of where I actually wanted - a rural area. Colgate University had been called the most beautiful campus in America, this such environment make me feels that I am fulfill with energy everyday. I with no doubt that choosing this college is definitely right, because its has everything you want, and serving variety great opportunities to everyone. I love the dormitory, the scene outside the window, nevertheless - everything."
Alum,5,"Going to Colgate was a fantastic experience. I still have many friends from there. Fortunately, I was able to receive a scholarship to attend. Otherwise it is quite pricey."
Junior,5,"Phenomenal school with something for everyone. Colgate has all of the intimate class sizes of a great liberal arts college with all of the vast resources of a major university - not only do you get a world class education, but there is literally no opportunity they won't throw money at you to do if you put your mind to it. Study abroad is also a stand-out due to a number of faculty-run semester programs, which give you the benefit of traveling with classmates and friends rather than strangers. Countless clubs and activities, which is where you'll meet most of your friends. The campus is gorgeous and still takes my breath away."
Freshman,5,"Colgate has a great core curriculum program that encompasses a variety of courses and really gives you a good foundation for a liberal arts education. The distribution requirements seemed silly to me when I started, but I really appreciate the classes they have encouraged me to take. Overall, a good college in a pretty little town, emphasis on the little."
Alum,5,"Colgate is the place for me! As a sciences major being able to study at Colgate enabled me to have a much greater breadth of learning, which has benefited tremendously both culturally and financially in my life."
Freshman,5,"Academics are challenging but professors are very available.  Diversity is still a challenge at Colgate, but there is a Cultural Center for socializing and activism.  Very small town, very safe, but sometimes little much to do off campus, unless you have access to a vehicle.  Syracuse is a 45 minute drive.  Party scene is great if you know upper classmen, especially as a  first year male.  Campus is a short walk to town; well organized and one can walk 10 minutes to any part of campus.  Food and housing are average but dining hall is open 24 hours; great for athletes and late night studying."
Sophomore,5,"Best college ever! I love everything about Colgate from the small class sizes to the food to the atmosphere to the people. Although, Colgate isn't every well known it shouldn't be looked over! Courses are challenging but very rewarding."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a first year here at Colgate and I can tell you that it is the best school that I could have possibly picked. I am extremely challenged in the classroom, averaging 6-7 hours in the library daily, but then at night I am able to be social which is so necessary in such an academic environment. "
Recent Alumnus,5,"Colgate is even better than I had hoped it would be.  Torchlight, DanceFest, and all sporting events like football, m/w ice hockey, soccer, basketball...what a great Colgate experience.  The campus is exquisite."
College Sophomore,5,Colgate University is a small liberal arts undergraduate college. It has a beautiful campus in upper state New York with roiling hills views of mountains and beautiful and unique brick buildings . Colgate has great acedemics and athletics with a diverse students from all walks of life.
College Sophomore,5,"Insane. Wouldn't trade it for any other school's party life. Besides the exclusivity of fraternity parties, there seems to always be someone getting down and having fun. Whether its meeting new people, bonding with friends, or just making amazing memories Colgate's party scene is a lot and a lot of fun."
College Sophomore,5,"Honestly the choices, rigor, and professors all make the entire college worth staying in. With all of its flaws and issues, Colgate's academics are phenomenal."
College Sophomore,5,"Honestly I love the professors and classes. Every single class I have taken I have loved and every single professor I have had, has been so incredibly different than what I was used to in high school. The courses are numerous and there are so many options in a prestigious liberal arts college like Colgate. I am blessed for the education I am receiving from this institution."
College Sophomore,5,"Great football team. Almost always the football team frat is throwing down and especailly for Freshman boys its nice to have as an outlet if you know some football players. Super chill guys. Besides football varsity sports teams stay pretty within themselves and rarely look for close friends outside their teams. We have great athletics which in turn creates stellar athletic facilities. Some varsity sports are even pretty easy to walk on to, but they require commitment. Club sports also reign pretty highly in the Colgate social scene. Lax, rugby, and ultimate frisbee are some of the most intense club teams on campus and in the Northeast. Lax and rugby also work really well as segues into the fraternity scene which is an added bonus to the relationships you forge on the teams."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel extremely safe on campus. I am not alone in saying that I often will leave my belongings in the library or another study area unattended for any amount of time, and am confident that it will still be there, untouched, when I return. I have no qualms about walking back to my dorm late at night after studying for a big test, as I know I am always safe. Campus safety officers are really helpful and truly look out for the good of the students, though they often get a bad rep for breaking up a party or two."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Colgate because the campus is engaging in all corners - from the professors in the classroom, to the students involved in extracurriculars. Everyone wants you to be exposed to as much as possible and get the most out of your experience."
College Sophomore,5,Professors are exceptionally passionate about their fields and about teaching.  Colgate is the type of place where a professor will reach out to you if you are sick and ask you if you want to get coffee and catch up on what you missed.  They're incredible.
College Sophomore,5,Colgate is highly respected and because we have such a strong alumni network it is not hard to find a job after graduation especially if you are interested in finance or business.
College Sophomore,5,"We are a D-1 sports school at a small liberal arts school so we get the enthusiasm and school spirit that comes with a large sports community, but also the great academics."
College Sophomore,5,"Everything about Colgate is exceptional.  The professors are some of the most caring, passionate, interesting people I have ever met and genuinely want their students to succeed. The motto work-hard play-hard is definitely taken seriously at this school."
College Junior,5,Superior academics and professors. Super smart and friendly student body. Gorgeous campus.
Recent Alumnus,5,Colgate is rigorous and the workload is intense.  There are internships and study abroad options that offer some of the best experiences in the world.
Recent Alumnus,5,A degree from Colgate is golden.  The alumni network is world-renown and are the most loyal anywhere.  Colgate's reputation is second to none.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Classes at Colgate are rigorous and the workload is intense, but the professors are engaging, accessible, and know you by name.  It is a school that encourages discussion and participation, not isolation and solitude."
College Freshman,5,"There is a wide variety of courses available for students, including a wide variety of courses that fulfill general education requirements.  The professors are all very willing to talk to students, and look forward to speaking with students during office hours.  The small class sizes make it very easy to ask questions and get to know both the professor and other students."
College Freshman,5,"Some of the best experiences I have had thus far have been inside of the classroom, and at outside academic events. Everyone on campus seems to be extremely interested in a great education, but can all balance their lives between academics and social life.  I would choose this school over again because there are a ton of great opportunities on campus both academically and socially."
College Sophomore,5,"There is no shortage of parties at Colgate. This is definitely debatable if you're a freshman guy, but if you get involved and make friends in frats you'll likely be fine. There's always something happening on Friday nights, Saturdays (""Fraturdays"") and Saturday nights. Wednesday nights are also popular, and it's not uncommon for big nights out to occur on Mondays or Thursdays. Tuesdays are also occasionally a thing. There are often frat parties, and many nights students will flock to the Jug, which is Hamilton's version of a night club. So basically Colgate students rage hard and rage often; you can go out an average of 4 times a week, as long as you manage to finish your work on time."
College Sophomore,5,"Most parties occur at the frats, but there are also many nights when students flock downtown to the Jug or the bars. Weekends are always a sure thing, and you can depend on something big happening on at least one weeknight every week. Colgate students rage hard and rage often."
College Sophomore,5,Colgate alumni really look out for each other. The career services also is pretty helpful in finding internships and gathering information. Colgate graduates have proven to be very successful.
College Freshman,5,The alumni network at Colgate is well-renowned and cares about Colgate students.
College Freshman,5,"Colgate classes are top notch. You will receive a great education here, with small class sizes and helpful professors."
College Senior,5,Colgate has an excellent alumni network and great job placement.
College Senior,5,Colgate has some of the best professors anywhere.
College Senior,5,How many schools have the Dean of Admission write a personalized note on your acceptance letter?
Recent Alumnus,5,"Colgate students deal with a heavy workload facing not only grade deflation and competition from other classmates, but also a mandatory five course core curriculum with low overlap among majors. Only the best students can maintain a GPA above 3.67 with most falling into the 3.3 to 2.7 range. Full fledged professors are amazing to learn in upper courses while visiting professors often feel like they are phoning it in for introductory classes. Of note for special study options is a chance to intern in Washington D.C. for a semester as a political science student (one student interns for a Supreme Court justice) or as a biology or chemistry student at the National Institutes of Health. For a Biology or Chemistry student, you get to work on important, basic research in understanding and treating human disease such as cancer, diabetes, or influenza. During the ebola scare, one student's lab was actually the lab working on the treatment. The NIH study abroad opportunity is not only a chance to be exposed for 40 hours a week to world class biomedical research but it is also a networking opportunity for future internship and professional schooling."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors and courses taught at Colgate are world-tier courses. Students are asked to take on a heavy workload across multiple disciplines and it does not stop even in your last semester. Class sizes are small except for a handful of auditorium introductory classes which many majors require underclassmen to take. Expect class sizes of under 20 people and in many cases under 15. Most courses are taught lecture style with some back and forth questions to the students.  As for how you are graded, even in the large classes multiple choice exams are rare and frowned upon. Exams are designed to have one or two questions that only one or two students who have understood the material front and back will be able to answer. Grade deflation is a trend across all disciplines at Colgate. This is particularly evident with the Chemistry department coming under fire from an independent review for harming graduate school prospects due to overenthusiastic grade deflation.

Colgate has a mandatory core curriculum of five classes as well as a distribution requirement of classes across disciplines. Those wishing to double major or go onto graduate/professional school should be reminded to carefully and religiously plan out courses with an adviser. The core curriculum is a prestigious menu of courses that teach students about ancient and modern epistemology, insights into science and technology, and global cultures. At the same time, the core curriculum presents a burden on students particularly those that choose to major in math or science due to lack of overlap. The new Global Engagements course is experiencing growing pains in terms of course diversity and theme implementation across professors."
Recent Alumnus,5,Colgate students entering into business of some kind will thank their degree for the connections it will build with the vast business alumni network. Science students graduating with a 3.0 or above GPA outperform graduates at other universities with similar grades.
Freshman,4,"I take four classes online. Most of them adapted very well to the online environment, but some professors are still obviously having a hard time adjusting."
Alum,4,"I loved my experience at Colgate! Great academics, very social atmosphere! However, there was an adjustment period my freshman year. Colgate is not particularly diverse and it is isolated in upstate New York. It took a bit of time to adjust to the self-contained dynamic."
Junior,4,"I have had the best time at Colgate University. The professor student ratio allows for students to gain personal relationships with their professors which enabled me to learn more effectively. The academic sector of Colgate is difficult, but professors want you to excel and help you achieve your goals. As for the social scene at Colgate, it is epic, but only if you are involved in Greek Life, a sports team or a club. Unfortunately, Colgate itself is an exclusive school and the social scene is even more exclusive, but if you are in one of the type of groups mentioned above, your social calender will always be full. Colgate is fun, but not as much fun for others. Colgate lacks diversity and makes it hard for minorities to have as good of a time as the white upper class students. There have been many racist incidents by students and faculty and there seems to not ever be any severe punishment unless the student body overwhelms the school with emails and letters."
Alum,4,The online learning was good. Professors did a good job of adjusting to this new learning and teaching environment.
Freshman,4,"Really nice campus, good sense of community. Dining halls are aggressively average, and the town is small, so if you need to wander/have new scenery, bring a car. Professors are really smart and engaging."
Freshman,4,"I've only been at Colgate for a semester, but I've had many great experiences. I found my circle of friends at a pre-orientation program which really helped with my transition into college, and Colgate's campus is small enough so that I see familiar faces every day. One of my concerns before coming here was that I wouldn't have much to do outside campus (since Hamilton is in the middle of nowhere), but there are numerous events that take place on campus (there are also shuttles that transport students to the Destiny U.S.A. on Saturdays for free). The small class sizes are great because I've been able to interact with my classmates and professors often, and although homework/studying keeps me busy, I still have a reasonable amount of leisure time every day. One drawback I'd like to mention is that the student body isn't very diverse (which hasn't led to any negative experiences for me personally but I know it has for others)."
Freshman,4,"Located in Hamilton, NY, Colgate University does a great job giving students a home away from home. The sense of community makes a welcoming and easy transition from high school to higher-level education. Parties are there if desired, but not needed to enjoy your time at Colgate. The university tries its best to diversify the student body but, it is still far from what it should be. Colgate sports division 1 athletic teams, with free tickets to all games for students. Being one of the top liberal arts colleges in the U.S., the academics offered at Colgate challenge its students. Two new dorm buildings joined the ever-expanding campus in fall 2019. Most students reside on campus, however, off-campus housing options are also available, usually occupied by upperclassmen and athletes. Financial aid is offered along with numerous work-study jobs on campus to mitigate the costs of tuition. The beautiful rural campus is kept safe by campus police and the emergency blue light system."
Junior,4,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Colgate. I think one of the better aspects of the university is how much the professors care about individual students whether or not they are their advisees or even in the major taught by that professor. I have always felt like my professors wanted to see me succeed and that has definitely shaped my experience here."
Senior,4,Colgate is a reputable small university with excellent education programme and very promising future career prospects!
Alum,4,"Colgate academically was an excellent undergraduate institution. I was exposed to dedicated professors who truly cared about the advancement of their students. I was certainly held to a high standard, which although daunting at times is something I am very grateful for. The campus and village of Hamilton are also places I will miss whenever I am away from them. I truly fell in love with the local area, and I plan to return as often as possible. The only complaint I have about Colgate is the social scene. Although I had a great time, not being involved in Greek life certainly hurt my ability to excel socially. I often felt ostracized from the general student body and sometimes struggled to feel part of the social life."
Freshman,4,"Find your place. It is a small school, which makes it a student-oriented campus. Everyone knows everyone and the classes are smaller sizes. There also is not much in the town, but you find friends then you find things to do."
Sophomore,4,"Rigorous academics and plenty of resources to assist students. Comfortable facilities to learn, study, and exercise in as well. Beautiful campus with great elevated views. Overall, a wonderful place to call home for 4 years."
Junior,4,"I have had a great time at Colgate so far. I have met some amazing people and I am getting a world-class education. I am pursuing a degree in computer science as well and I just finished the hardest course that I have ever taken in my college career, which was algorithms. I'm really starting to enjoy computer science, especially because it's so rewarding when you finish a really challenging problem. In terms of the overall campus, there is still much to be desired. As an African-American man, I notice that there is a lack of other African-American male students and professors and I would love for there to be more diversity on campus. However, there is an atmosphere of comradery amongst many people of color across campus and it is a blessing to know that when I feel alone, I will always have someone on campus that will listen to me."
Junior,4,Colgate allows you to go to school with a lot of America's richest children. That connection to Corporate America is second to none.
College Sophomore,4,I believe the college takes this issue seriously.
College Sophomore,4,"It is a small campus with many housing choices.There are dorms , townhouses apartments and Greek life housing to chose from.  Most students live on campus ."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a balance of Greek life , athletics and academics"
College Sophomore,4,I am on the football team of a Division 1 AA program . Colgate has competative athletics in a close knit community. We have a great coaching staff and support academically .
College Sophomore,4,"Career services will hound you and haunt you throughout your life at Colgate. Whether it is finding you opportunities or making sure your resume is flawless, career services is really looking out for its students and ensuring them that they find employment."
College Sophomore,4,"As a member of the Drake dorm this past freshman year, I was able to participate in the Ciccone Commons residential learning program. The Commons is a new school initiative in order to foster more of a community through sharing dorms with your classmates in your link group. The program had amazing benefits including renovated dorms, great CLs(RAs), and a multitude of small perks including coffee/hot chocolate on the first floor, fun activities, and free, catered, delicious food."
College Sophomore,4,"Personally, I have loved my housing experience thus far. I was assigned to Andrews for my first year, which I was very happy with. I was placed in a 5 person suite which featured two bedrooms and a spacious common room that was great for social gatherings and hanging out with friends. The Community Leaders (similar to an RA) for the most part are pretty relaxed, which I preferred, but I could also understand people thinking that there was not enough enforcement at times. Because freshman housing is so close to academic buildings, I could often wake up 15 minutes before class and get there with time to spare which was awesome. I will be living in a 16 person townhouse for sophomore year, which is really nice so I am excited! I did see, however, that some of my friends did not have as favorable as results with the housing process, and are very upset with their accommodations for the next year."
College Sophomore,4,"Being that I haven't had the opportunity to partake in greek life just yet, this rating may come to change. However, something that I particularly loved about my first year at Colgate is that there was no pressure to rush or worry about joining a greek organization because we have a delayed rush system, in which we rush sophomore year. This is tough on freshmen guys who (for the most part) aren't able to go to parties their first year, but that has its own positive aspects to it as it allowed many of the guys to form close friendships away from the complications of adding fraternity obligations into the mix."
College Sophomore,4,"I think the focus on athletics at Colgate is the perfect amount for the size of the school. While I wish that some sports teams garnered more fans for my friends who are athletes, I think it is also good that athletes aren't glorified like they are at some schools."
College Senior,4,"I wish the varsity teams-- especially the women's teams-- got more support at home games, but the problem is that there's always so much going on at Colgate, and we're a small school anyway, so there's never going to be a huge crowd at sporting events like at a Big Ten school of something. That said, the Colgate-Cornell Hockey games get a big turn out, and occasionally other big games do too, and when this happens, it's a lot of fun. Generally, though, people have a lot of school spirit but they just don't make attending games a priority. It's too bad because Colgate is DI and many of the teams do really well. 

Club sports and IM Sports are obviously overshadowed by the varsity teams, but the club and IM teams themselves always seem to be having a lot of fun. Rugby, waterpolo, and skiing, and ultimate frisbee are all well known for being activities with a good mix of fun, competitive, and social opportunity. 

As for facilities, they're all really nice, and that's important because people at Colgate love to work out. The fitness center, open to everyone, is spacious and beautiful. The upstairs is full of treadmills and ellipticals while the downstairs is for lifting. Then there's the rest of the gym, which has a few basketball courts, a squash court, a pool, rooms for fitness classes, a rock wall, etc. 

The football stadium and soon-to-be-opened new hockey stadium are beautiful as well. Colgate also has some nice (but very hilly, IMO) cross country trails. There's even a small bowling alley. There's even the old ski hill, if you're willing to walk up it. There's pretty much everything you could want... except a roller rink."
College Sophomore,4,Colgate is extremely safe.  People don't ever lock their doors and you can leave a laptop in the library unwatched for hours and not have to worry that it will be gone when you get back.
College Sophomore,4,There needs to be more sororities on campus to accommodate the amount of women who want to join one
College Sophomore,4,"General campus safety and security is good. There are close to 0 reports of theft. However, some campus safety officers are not well-trained, especially in regards to race and mental health concerns."
College Sophomore,4,"Colgate has an excellent reputation for its academics and there are many excellent career prospects, many of which are available through alumni networks. However, this varies from field to field, inevitably."
College Sophomore,4,There is a great variety of courses offered and the professors are extremely helpful and competent. Class sizes are typically smaller (20=average class size) and each student is paid a lot of attention.
College Sophomore,4,We have excellent athletic programs and good gym facilities for students and faculty.
College Sophomore,4,"Considering Colgate University is a small, prestigious school, it is not racially diverse. However, there is an incredible amount of resources, funding and guidance available. The courses are taught only by the professors and all the faculty members are incredible kind, compassionate and competent in their fields."
Recent Alumnus,4,Safety at Colgate is the norm and threatening or harassing students are unheard of.  Colgate is a rural campus with its own transportation into town and around campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Colgate is the David among Goliaths, and has beaten them all.  Colgate has had the highest Division I graduation rate for student-athletes by the NCAA in the country, ahead of Stanford, Harvard, and Notre Dame, to name a few.  The motto, ""Work hard, play hard"" is engraved in the Colgate spirit.  From nationally-ranked men's and women's ice hockey, football, and lacrosse teams to being voted the 2nd Most Fit College Campus in America by GQ Magazine, Colgate thrives on competition and has loyal fan support, particularly at away games throughout the country.  Everyone at Colgate, especially alums, bleed Colgate Maroon through and through."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, but there are places in which students may not feel as comfortable or as safe.  There is a constant presence of Campus Safety and there are blue lights all across campus."
College Freshman,4,"The alumni network is very active and from the first-year, Career Services helps students set up shadow days and internships. The quality of employers recruiting from Colgate is great and Career Services has a wide variety of programs available to students."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of student-athletes on campus, and most of the students that are not on a varsity team participate in club/intramural sports or go to the gym often.  There are a decent amount of sports fans, but the sporting events are not a huge part of overall student life."
College Sophomore,4,"As its prestigious reputation would imply, academics are very rigorous at Colgate. The classes are for the most part interesting and definitely challenging. It's considerably harder to get A's here than most other schools, but you will definitely learn a lot from your professors and peers."
College Sophomore,4,"Most students party a lot, and party hard, which can obviously contribute to a certain extent of health/safety issues. However Colgate is extremely safe in the fact that anyone can walk around campus alone at night without any worries, and students constantly keep their doors unlocked and leave expensive bags, computers and phones out to save spots in the dining hall or library without any fear of their things being stolen."
College Sophomore,4,All of the professors I've had are very accessible and obviously care about students' education and well being.
College Sophomore,4,"It really depends on where you end up living, but each building has its pros and cons. The lottery is stressful but every dorm is relatively close to classes and it's fairly convenient to get to the dining halls/gym/etc from any residential building. Senior year you can live off campus, but only if you and your friends are approved. Overall the housing is pretty solid and there are really no bad options."
College Sophomore,4,"What's unique about Colgate is that you don't actually rush until your sophomore year. Right now Colgate officially has 3 sororities and 5 existing fraternities, but there may or may not be existing underground groups that like to rage as well. Girls honestly only need to join a sorority if they're genuinely interested in all of the aspects of the sisterhood, and really want to be able to attend mixers with frats, the frequency of which varies depending on which sorority you're in. Guys who want to be part of the social scene should definitely try to join though, as most of the party scene revolves heavily around frats."
College Sophomore,4,"Our varsity sports teams actually do pretty well in their league, but games are really only attended during play-off season or rivalry games. It's still fun to attend games when you personally know the players, which is pretty common at a small school like Colgate. Participation in club sports and intramurals is also quite common. The rigor of club varies depending on the sport, but anyone can sign up for intramural leagues. Colgate is known for having some of the most fit students in the country, and while part of that can be attributed to the school's being located on a hill, it's also due to the fact that most students participate in a club or varsity sport. The gym is also super nice and is free to all students. I personally wish tailgates and varsity game attendance were more prevalent - especially considering that games are free for students - but overall if you're into working out or playing sports recreationally Colgate is pretty great."
College Sophomore,4,"Colgate is academically rigorous, tons of fun and absolutely beautiful. If I had to do it all over again I'd definitely choose 'Gate."
College Freshman,4,"The academics are great here, professors are very passionate about their fields."
College Freshman,4,"I love the athletics, being a student athlete myself. I wish we were a school that is more supportive of our athletes and competitions."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, especially because we are in the middle of nowhere."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are nice, especially the new Drake and Curtis dorms. They have suite style for first-years which is a bonus."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics are there, but not a huge part of life. The football team won the Patriot League this year, and hockey games are well attended."
College Senior,4,My only complaint is the gender segregated floors in West Hall. What year is it?
College Sophomore,4,"An internship is garnered through alumni connections - usually free, but fantastic experience"
College Sophomore,4,Very small but very homely
College Sophomore,4,"The housing is fantastic. The location is prime for classes no matter what year you are. In addition, the rooms themselves are cleanly and well maintained"
College Sophomore,4,Definitely working on building diversity
College Sophomore,4,Very intelligent and good looking
College Sophomore,4,CAMPO is fantastic and then the health facilities are great!
College Sophomore,4,It's great whatever you choose (on or off).
College Sophomore,4,We have a variety of days to go out and only two days dedicated for late night work. Otherwise the frats and local bars are extremely fun!
College Sophomore,4,They cater to the students so the restaurants we have are amazing and delicious
College Sophomore,4,They are strict when they need to be and not overly harsh where you feel claustrophobic
College Sophomore,4,The school has a plentiful amount of financial aid available for those students that need it and they give 100% what is needed
Senior,2,"Pretty bad, some professors are very nice and forgiving but most assume that with the additional free time we have that we should be doing more work. Incredibly hard graders as well."
Senior,2,"When I came in as a freshman in 2017, Colgate was a great time with incredible social events, kind administrators and professors, and a gorgeous campus. Now the only positive description I still have for the school is that it has a pretty campus. The new leadership at Colgate is on a full-out attack against greek life, parties, drinking, among other things; please don't apply or select this school based on these Niche ratings as they are terribly outdated and do not reflect the current climate at this school."
College Sophomore,2,"Rape is a real threat and especially at Colgate sexual assault is a clear and very present danger. Colgate has on average of 3% more sexual assault than the average college student. After our Campus Climate Survey which interviewed around 800 members of the student body( 75%ish being women) almost 13% of the responders listed some sort of sexual assault. This compared to the national average of 9%ish is very scary. There have been numerous movements and sitins in order to prompt the university into acting and changing the system, however, their voices have fallen upon deaf ears. Colgate will always experience abnormal amounts of sexual assault because of the Greek system and its many flaws."
College Sophomore,2,"Diversity is lacking at Colgate, however students seem to be quite tolerant of all sexual orientations/races/classes/etc., at least in my experience. While the majority of students seem to be white, wealthy WASPS, people aren't going to treat you poorly if you're not."
College Freshman,2,The drug scene is very big here. Many people partake and a lot of students use the dark web to get various drugs. Most people do drugs
College Freshman,2,"Overall, a majority of people do not feel safe walking around campus alone. By people I mean females, because sexual assaults are so common."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Greek life is too strong on campus. It acts to alienate students who choose to go non-Greek and routinely violate hazing rules to earn only slaps on the wrist. Greek alumni donors have the school in a stranglehold and act to soften any punishment against their houses. Greek students pay lip service to how they remain friends with non-Greek students. The fact is almost all social interaction on weekends is concentrated at the Greek houses. Lastly, Greek life is responsible for most social disruptions and alcohol/drug violations on campus."
College Freshman,2,"I have almost finished my first semester here and I can't find anything to do. All the students here do is drink. If you are not into the party scene, do not believe that Colgate offers other stuff to do."
College Sophomore,2,You need to drive a minimum of 40 min. for new food.
College Sophomore,2,The food is just not good.
College Freshman,2,"There are not that many option, but the options are alright. The late night food scene is poor. There is one pizzeria. Don't get me wrong its good but nothing very very very good... maybe when you're drunk."
College Sophomore,2,There are not that many places to eat around Colgate.
College Sophomore,2,There is almost nothing to do in town. There are only a handful of restaurants.
College Sophomore,2,Most people are uninterested in forming real relationships.
College Sophomore,2,"Off-campus housing is difficult because Colgate has very limited off campus housing. Also, people apply early (during their sophomore year in order to get housing), but Colgate's lottery system makes it so that that housing can be denied senior year."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of diversity at the school. However, the school is working on making Colgate a better and more comfortable place for students of all different types of backgrounds."
College Freshman,2,Frat houses are about it
College Freshman,2,Rooms are small and the bathrooms are dirty
College Freshman,2,Other than DU or the jug it's awful
College Senior,2,"As an underclassmen, you've got about all of one option: fraternity parties. Oh, you're not into those? Too bad. Guess you'll just have to wait until you make a lot of upperclassmen friends (so you can party in their apartments) or until you become one yourself."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek Life is a superficial and meaningless part of campus life. It is extremely exclusive and there are only 3 sororities for girls to choose from while there are 6 frats. That being said, the frats are where the parties are held and without them the night life would be less prominent."
College Sophomore,2,There really aren't very many decent places.
College Senior,2,Everyone appears to be white and wealthy.
College Senior,2,"Not enough fraternities and sororities. The process is insanely competitive, and you have to be working at it early as a guy."
College Senior,2,"Not many options. Slices, and a couple other pizza places go with some sports bars and La Iguana."
College Senior,2,"Most people go to Colgate accepting the fact that Hamilton is small and remote. It's a beautiful place, but don't look for a variety of places to eat or public transportation. The relationship between the town and students seems good though."
College Senior,2,"Dumb process of having seniors enter a lottery and only so many off campus permits are given out. Also, there aren't enough places to live so people begin signing leases during their sophomore year."
College Sophomore,2,"This school feels extremely homogenous, with many kids being rich and white.  The school's isolation amplifies this feeling.  Most, if not all, minority groups feel they are not represented on campus well, and feel ""different"" from the majority group.  This includes ethnic and sexual minorities."
College Sophomore,2,"Relationships do not exist at Colgate.  There is a very fervent hookup culture there, which affects the interactions between boys and girls daily.  A majority of the kids at the school are very preppy and rich as well, and nearly everyone wears the same clothing brands in the same styles.  That said, overall, the students that attend Colgate are decent."
College Junior,2,"We only have a few places in town, after a few weeks people are dying to get off campus and get better food even if they drive an hour each way."
College Freshman,2,"I mean the officers can be pretty nice, its just never fun to hear about people getting in trouble at parties."
College Freshman,2,Only a handful of seniors get to live off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Colgate is a very homogenous campus - upperclassmen, white, preppy, goodlooking New Englanders. I am a minority and student here with different backgrounds dlcertainly can find their niche! But there students here are generally of the same sort."
College Freshman,2,Very homogenous but not unaccepting - just ignorant
College Freshman,2,"School provides low cost transportation to Syracuse airport, Utica Amtrak, and the Port Authority of New York."
College Freshman,2,Plenty of moisture and cold temperatures.   Early fall is beautiful. 
College Freshman,2,The food is incredibly variable.
College Freshman,2,"During the winter, it can get very cold and windy."
College Freshman,2,Colgate isn't very diverse at all. But I don't think there is any racism or acceptance issues.
College Freshman,2,"It's absolutely freezing during the winter, to the point where it will stop people from going out certain nights of the week."
College Freshman,2,"The weather is very bipolar. One week we had a snow day and a day were it was too hot to wear a coat! It is however  manageable and Colgate does an excellent job with snow plowing, the school has an underground heating system designed to heat the ground when snow falls. "
College Freshman,2,There are a few restaurants but not many. The worst part are the prices!
College Freshman,2,"There is a lot of social drinking and I have heard of people using cocaine but have not seen it. Drinking is big on campus, but if you are not into that kind of thing there are lots of things that you can do that don't involve drinking. "
College Senior,2,"Don't even think about parking up the hill during school hours, unless you like multiple parking tickets and perhaps a towing charge here and there.  After school hours though, you're free to park anywhere you want (but what's the point if you're an upperclassman?).  If you live off-campus, you can park on Lally Lane, but spaces fill up QUICKLY, forcing you to park near the gym, and telling yourself ""I could have just walked from my house..."". In summary, I'd say parking is horrible here."
College Senior,2,"Greek life at Colgate is a small part of the social scene for girls--it doesn't affect friends' groups at ALL. Guys, however, have a much harder time finding social outlets without joining a frat. There are, of course, sports and activities guys are involved in- as far as night life, though, frats are where it's at!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"May have some privacy and no bothering from campo/RA but that is it.
not so close to the campus and without a car, it gets inconvenient."
College Sophomore,2,"Admittedly, Colgate does have a pretty cookie-cutter student body.  The stereotype that the campus is comprised mainly of WASPs who embody the prepster/J. Crew lifestyle is pretty accurate.  Ethnically, Colgate is predominantly white, though a recent surge in international students has slightly diversified the campus.  Financial aid students definitely make up a healthy portion of the student body, however they definitely attempt to assimilate themselves into the wealthy Anglo-American image Colgate gives off.  Colgate is the definition of mainstream upper class."
College Freshman,2,"The typical transport option is the Colgate Cruiser. It is a really nice idea because it is free and will take you all over the campus and down into the town if you are not feeling the walk. It is very handy in the mornings for students who live at the bottom of the hill who would like a ride up the hill to their classes. However, as the day goes on its reliability wanes. It is often not on schedule and sometimes doesn't show at all. That being said, there are a higher number of cruisers on weekend nights until about 3 am so party-goers have an easy and safe way to get home. These rides can be pretty crazy adventures. The only expensive transit comes from travelling home. It can be pricey to take a bus to another city or to the Syracuse airport. However, buses can be shared so that the price is split and there have been initiatives in this past year to get students bus tickets at very reduced rates."
College Freshman,2,"It's nice that students can have cars starting their freshman years, but student parking is at the bottom of the hill and it becomes an annoying walk, especially coming back up.  It takes about 7 minutes to walk down and twice that to walk back up.  It's usually crowded and takes a little while to find an open spot."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone at Colgate looks the same.  There is minimal diversity.  I personally, as an african-american girl, attended a private high school where the majority of the girls were caucasian so I was not as bothered by it at first.  Seeing people who look different from you and being the only minority in class 24/7 gets kind of old at times, but there is diversity if you look for it, and it shouldn't inhibit how you make friends and socialize on campus."
College Junior,2,"I would hardly call the downtown ""downtown"" as it is one of the smallest ones I have ever seen. Doesn't bother some people, very much bothers those who like to do more than hang out at the 3 same restaurants and bars every weekend. Did I mention there's no edible Chinese food here?"
College Sophomore,2,There are 4 on campus locations and they are all mediocre and have roughly the same food.
College Sophomore,2,"Tries, but Fails – Frank dining hall, at times, tries to add variety and fit the needs of vegetarian/vegan student; however, they usually end up giving almost the same meals every week. Sometimes you will find things just aren't available, often at the inconvenience of vegetarians. After a month or two, everyone gets a little bored of the food, and most go on a limited meal plan after freshman year. if you are particular eater, like me, you will want to go off the meal plan as soon as possible because it just does not fit your needs."
College Sophomore,2,Its Okay – As a sophomore I have only lived on campus. I do know some people that live off campus though. The rent is high and its not very convenient.  They are far away from campus and there isn't convienent parking if you want to drive.
College Freshman,2,The weather varies from great to terrible depending on the day.
College Junior,2,"You Can Do What You Want – Colgate basically assumes ""it's college, kids are gonna party"".  Its a work hard, play hard atmosphere that the administration seems to have no control over.  While some RAs will write you up if the catch you drinking on campus, the frats and spring party weekend all have basically no rules."
College Junior,2,"I'm the type of person that like a lot of foreign food, and that just isn't here.  There are 2 pizza places, subway, mcdonalds, icecream, boring chinese, mexican, and jewish-sushi.  Yes, Jews putting salmon and dill in a sushi roll.  I would make my own food, but the grocery stores are severely lacking as well.  The food doesn't taste bad, but it all tastes the same."
College Sophomore,2,"Campo's Lazy – So we call our Campus Police Campo, and they're kinda lazy. I live in substance free housing and a kid lives two doors down from me and smokes weed EVERY DAY. Campo has done nothing about this despite the fact that we complain insessantly. Also, I have friends who've legitamately smoked/been high infront of these officers and they turn a blind eye. It's not ok"
College Sophomore,2,"DI Here Is a Joke – I love Colgate but, for the most part, our sports are not good (Rugby's the only exception). I'm not sure why, but we're rarely the top teams in our league. Also we have a lot of student athletes and so everyone's always busy with their own practices and games, so we can never seem to get enough people to come out to games."
College Junior,2,"Not Worth It – Most of the student body lives in campus housing, the only exception being getting an apartment downtown. These apartments and houses are nice (sometimes) but are expensive and usually require you to sign a lease in the beginning of your sophomore year for senior year housing. Only a select amount of seniors are allowed to live of campus and leases can fall through and deposits can be lost. It is all around easier and more convenient to live in the townhouses or apartments which are maintained by the University and kept clean and functioning."
Senior,1,"If you're looking for a work-hard play-hard school that Colgate seems to be, keep looking. What used to be a paradise of great professors, helpful administration, incredible nightlife is no longer. The school is cracking down HARD on fraternities and sororities which, in a tiny town in the middle of no where, was one of the few social outlets on campus (there exist only 2 [small] bars near campus). The administration has been prioritizing a certain type of student, and value faculty and prospective students far more than the students already on campus. During one of the strictest quarantines in the nation, Colgate was sending students home for visiting friends in residence halls... while simultaneously inviting high schoolers and their families from around the country to tour campus.

If you are very smart and don't care about social life, this is not the student population you want to be apart of. If you like going out and having a good time, this is not the admin that will allow it"
Senior,1,"For some reason, Colgate professors decided that even though teaching, learning, homework, and testing online is exponentially harder online, they would give us more work since we apparently have more free time in our days to do it. Online courses at Colgate are stressful and confusing."
Niche User,1,"Don't go to this school. I cry everyday now, It's a nightmare. The staff are as cold as the weather here"
Sophomore,1,"This place is the absolute worst. Systemic alcoholism, excessive drug use, high levels of sexual assault, lack of diversity, faculty and staff incompetence, and a general apathy suffocate any hope for incoming students, forcing them to assimilate into a toxic culture that wipes any sense of individuality clean. If you have any interest in learning or doing research, this is not the place for you."
Niche User,1,"Do NOT attend Colgate if you are an international student. HUGE lack of diversity and low presence of international folks. Community is not friendly/welcoming towards students of color. Racial issues exist and have upsetted many students big time. Majority is white, rich, preppy and party a lot. Very big party school and there is absolutely nothing to do unless you have a car or know someone who can drive you."
College Freshman,1,It is hard to find someone on campus that is not white. Most people on campus all look the same
College Freshman,1,Townies might be the worst things ever
College Freshman,1,No athletic support at all
College Senior,1,"I apply every time and they give nothing, even with siblings in college as well. Both of my siblings received some help, but Colgate offered nothing."
College Junior,1,"It is confusing, and most the student population doesn't need it. Its not worth the time to even apply."
College Freshman,1,Many students do not receive financial aid. It is hard to receive aid unless you are very poor.
College Freshman,1,Colgate needs way more diversity at it's campus. One of the very least diverse campuses. 
College Freshman,1,"There's a party scene, but I personally hate it.  "
College Freshman,1,Terrible dining. Maybe something good like once every week. 
College Senior,1,"Hamilton, NY is the most boring place on this planet. There are so many things I took for granted coming from New York City that are simply luxuries up here. Hamilton has all the bare necessities (and I mean ABSOLUTE BARE). You won't find any mall for 40 minutes and the closest 24 hour anything is close, but a car ride away. If you like things like city life and culture, STAY AWAY FROM COLGATE. It's incredibly isolated and if you don't have a car you will be incredibly stir crazy."
College Senior,1,"I didn't receive as much financial aid as I thought I should, and after taking a semester off, my grant was removed."
College Freshman,1,"Colgate is situated in Hamilton, New York.  Let's just say that the town's population drops in half when Colgate is not in session.  Hamilton is REALLY small and does not offer much.  There is an Indian restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, a few bars, two cafes, and the infamous Slices, which I'm sure you've read about.  There is not really any shopping and there is one movie theater that offers free movies to students every once in a while.  Besides the fact that the town itself doesn't offer much, Hamilton is in the middle of NOWHERE.  We are surrounded by miles and miles of farmland.  The closest city is Syracuse which is about a 45 minute drive.  Transportation in and out of upstate New York is also extremely difficult."
College Sophomore,1,"The drug scene at Colgate is very prominent. Students go out on a daily basis (most likely 4 nights a week). However, we mostly stick to alcohol and weed. For academic purposes, many students partake in the use of drugs to aid focus."
College Freshman,1,"Reslife is the epitome of incompetence – Though my experience with Colgate's Reslife is limited, the interaction with them has been abysmal. Not only are the employees incompetent, but  they put forth only the basest effort to help students. The only way to gain their attention is to complain consistently enough; even then it's unlikely that they'll actually try to correct whatever problem you have. Colgate recently fired the head of Reslife, seeking to improve the organization's quality, but it has proven to be entirely ineffective. Reslife is consistently unorganized, unprofessional and unhelpful. "
College Freshman,1,"Campo: Only There When You Don't Want Them – Campus safety aka campo is not helpful. Colgate just institute a new points system. Any points, and Varsity Athletics is notified if you are an athlete. One point for being underage and in the presence of alcohol. Four points for hosting a party with alcohol for underage students and/or drugs. Four points and your parents are notified. Ten and you're kicked out."

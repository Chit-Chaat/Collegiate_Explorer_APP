Freshman,5,Professors were great. The software used is intuitive and easy to use. There is a lot of resources available online as well.
Freshman,5,Trocaire is very accommodating. Small class sizes and great professors allow for the most optimal educational experience.
Freshman,5,"I love trocaire, they make me feel part of the school and guide you when ever needed. when I changed schools, I honestly was very nervous and didn't know what to expect. everyone their was there for me and helped in every way they could. it was a smooth transition and it is the best semester  i have has yet."

Niche User,5,"Right now I am going for a certificate program, but 3 weeks ago I applied to their Radiology Technician 2 year program and I received my answer today.  The schools has given an appointment for financial aid and an appointment with an advisor.  No other school has done this much within 3 weeks of me applying."
Junior,5,My experience has been great love the class sizes the opportunity they give to help with academics the clinical experience is another great aspect of the program
Sophomore,5,You are treated well and respected. Your time and opinions are valuable. Atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. Schedule is flexible
Sophomore,5,"Small college, easy to adapt and meet new people. Connections are great to help with studying and such small classrooms help learning go much easier. Trocaire is very hands on and good at making sure a student understand the material and prepares for future workforce as well as teach students what is needed to be successful"
Freshman,5,The small class sizes are great. You are able to get that one-on-one time you nay need in a class. The only thing that I would change is parking. The parking is terrible.
Freshman,5,This is my first semester at the college. The admissions process was painless. The advisors and professors have all been helpful.
Freshman,5,"It was a good first semester. The only problem was the parking. But it wasn't too bad, they provide a bus from the lot to the school which is nice. I didn't have any issues with staff. I don't know what they can do to improve. They have a lot of fun activities to do."
Freshman,5,It's a wonderful school. I had a lot of trouble applying to colleges because of my past grades and me not being in school for a few years. The administrative office was very helpful
Freshman,5,I like how friendly everyone is and helpful. I also like how it's not a huge college where I get lost and don't know anyone. Class sizes are perfect as well!
Freshman,5,"At Trocaire all of the instructors are very experienced to the easier way of teaching so students can grasp all of the information . I love the diversity ,and family like environment the staff supports your goals and desires , and i would like to see them create dorms so students can live on campus"

I am very excited to be starting my path for my career with these people and professors."

College Sophomore,5,"The classes are really flexible. They offer day courses, night courses, and hybrid courses (online)."
College Sophomore,5,"The class sizes are small. I like this because you can really get that one on one attention that is often needed. The class styles are pretty laid back. The professors are not uptight, which makes them relatable. There isn't also of choices with when it coms to humanities."
College Sophomore,5,There are a lot of employer recruiting on the campus. A lot of the professors have connections to various work programs. There is also job postings everywhere throughout the campus and people that are available on campus that can help assist with job applications and resumes.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Trocaire College, like honesty. They work with you and try their hardest to make lessons and assignments suitable for all students. They understand that there is a life after a student leaves school."
College Senior,5,Loved the education but the downfall is it's very expensive.
College Senior,5,The education was great. My teachers can teach in a way we can understand.
College Senior,5,Can't say too many times how fortunate I am to be in this program. I can only say great things about the faculty. The hospital setting was amazing I was taught by a lot of great people.
College Senior,5,I did not take any online courses. I did find that the website and registration aspect was very easy.
College Senior,5,The workload is reasonable. Studying is a necessity
College Senior,5,"The program is great. The faculty is by far the best experience of it. They're very helpful and teach in ways that you understand. The clinical experience is a big part as well, which is what I enjoyed the most. The ultrasound techs taught me so much and very patient when it was needed in the beginning. The are very glad to see how much I  have progressed."
College Senior,5,"I am so pleased with how the school, faculty and program has been for me throughout this journey. I am very grateful to have been accepted in the diagnostic medical ultrasound program knowing how difficult it is to be accepted. Attending school doesn't feel like school because I am excited to learn.  I enjoyed most my teachers and clinical experience. The college is very helpful in finding the career you really want. Great review across the board as far as the expense of it it's extremely expensive. I want this ultrasound career and will finish my education if need be with another loan. However with help it would mean the world to me. I believe that all this hard work and good grades will pay off. Thank you to the program director and school."
College Senior,5,Depending on your clinical experience it can be the best or worst part of school. For me hands on is the best way to go and that is why I loved the program that I was in.
College Senior,5,It is a nursing college with other smaller programs.  The school great for an AAS - RN
College Senior,5,The instructors are amazing.  There are so many opportunites for individual (free) tutoring services for nearly all the classes.  Registration is structured requiring meeting with an advisor prior to registering for each semester.
College Senior,5,"Very stressful, but rewarding.  Instructors go above and beyond to make sure you understand the information."
College Sophomore,5,I love they work me hard and expect the best out of their students.
College Sophomore,5,Trocaire works the hell out of its students.  They make sure you learn if you don't you will not make it they want the best students to walk out their doors
College Sophomore,5,Teachers have study groups. They make sure you have all resources you need to achieve your grade.
College Student,5,There is a wide range of ages and backgrounds in the student body. I am very impressed with my fellow students.
College Student,5,"I attend class in the computer lab. The campus network has never gone down, is reliable, and fast."
College Student,5,The have a staff member whose job is to match students to scholarships. Financial Aid personnel were very helpful in directing me to additional scholarship and grant resources.
College Student,5,Curriculum and computer lab are awesome. Actually building a computer is a first semester project!
College Student,5,I feel like I have finally found my career. The Computer Network Administration program is very hands-on - very advantageous for this field. Professors have been knowledgable and helpful.
College Junior,5,The teachers at Trocaire are very helpful and willing to make accommodations for you. I wasn't able to make it to a lab class so my instructor allowed me to come to her next lab 2 days later without losing participation credit 
College Senior,5,Very friendly and fast at responding and getting things completed.
College Sophomore,5,"Wonderful! I learned a lot and was prepared for my job field when I graduated.

The instructors were great!"
College Sophomore,5,they work hard to make sure you are able to pay for school. In my last semester before I had graduated 8yrs ago I had ran out of financial aid and student loans and I was doing a work study program and was not able to come up with the rest of my tuition so my work study boss had talked to the finacial administrator about the problem and a few days later I had gotten a call to come to his office and that is when he had told me that he had given me a grant for the full amount I needed so I could graduate! That was so wonderful of them to do that I have never forgotten it!
College Junior,5,"There are three different campuses you can attend based on the courses you need, however I've found all my courses at the Main Campus."
College Junior,5,"There are a variety of clubs. We have very small class sizes, that you'll receive a one on one instruction by your teacher. The school as a whole knows you by name instead of just being a number."
College Junior,5,"Yes, as in wireless access you have the ability to print any documents or class work in classrooms and on the on-campus library."
College Junior,5,"At Trocaire, they have a wide variety of courses you can take from a General Degree Program to a Bachelor Degree Program. My teachers are very knowledgeable and always there for help. Also, tutors are provided and have been known to help you in your studies."
College Junior,5,I have been told by current students in the Nursing Program that this is the best school to go to for Nursing.
College Junior,5,I think Trocaire College is excellent when it comes to getting out into the real world and finding a job. Their campus is actually connected to a hospital and every semester there is a clinical experience you have to complete in outside medical facilities. It really gives you a diverse experience and helps you to find what area of the medical field you would like to get into when you start applying for jobs.
College Sophomore,5,"Nice and Clean – Facilities such as bathrooms are always clean in the building. There are plenty of places to go and study in a nice, quiet area. The majority of students are not there for sporting activities, so it is good that the college uses its'space for academic purposes."
College Junior,5,So far I love the school and I'm very pleased with the decision I made in picking this school.
College Junior,5,Always Open and Willing to Talk – The Offices/resources are always there and willing to help out and meet the students needs and concerns.  Their doors are always open and the people their are very helping and caring.
College Junior,5,"Flexible Classes – I love how the classes are flexible and can fit around a persons busy work schedule.  If needed, someone could take classes on the weekend, another great thing is that the teachers there really know the material their teaching and make it interesting for the students to want to learn more."
Senior,4,I enjoy trocaire and the atmosphere. If you have a love God I think it’s perfect for you! I did second semester there and I enjoy it!
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love going to school here. They have tons of resources to help you succeed in your classes and to help you prepare for a career in health care. If you need tutoring or counseling it’s free. Most of the professors are great. They really take their time to get to know you. Small class sizes are also a perk! Trocaire has a very understanding and inviting community. The only downside is the price of tuition and the parking here at the school.
Freshman,4,"Overall good schol, leader in the area for healthcare field. Would like to see more organization of programs."
Sophomore,4,"Trocaire is the most affordable private college in my area. While the schooling cost is very pricey, being in a private college allows for more one on one attention. The only negative I have to say is the cost of books."
Sophomore,4,"I would like to be informed of more scholarship opportunities from my financial advisor; private school is not cheap. Over all professors are helpful, fair and always available. The college always includes the students whether they are on or off campus."
Sophomore,4,"Trocaire College offers the overall college experience to all students. Nestled away in the quietness of South Buffalo you always feel safe both on and off campus. Class sizes are very small so you receive a personalized experience and 1 on 1 attention when needed. Trocaire offers a variety of majors, including but not limited to healthcare and nursing programs."
Senior,4,"Trocaire was a great choice for me and my education. It was close to home, which was important since I don't drive. Great learning experiences through  clinical rotations to many local hospitals. Caring environment and small in size. Everyone knows everyone and they are here to help."
Junior,4,"Many resources for students such as tutoring, and counseling for students of all majors. Staff is very open to students asking for help. Campus is also working on  increasing diversity and inclusion."
Freshman,4,The trocaire experience has been great so far! The teachers are well educated and understand how to share this knowledge in the best way possible.
Sophomore,4,The most I like is not alot student in the classroom and the teacher help the student all time. The facility is cleand all time and the restroom. The help the student with tutoring when they need. The student can have totoring online or at the campus.
Junior,4,"It is a small campus with everything you need right there. It has small classes so the teacher-student ratio is usually 15-1. They offer many services for their students for free including a extensive library, work programs, tutors, and college activities."
Senior,4,"The class sizes are wonderful but the parking needs to be better. Their should be parking for students somewhere in the vacinity of the
school. The location of the school is very convenient. The instructor take the time to sit down and talk to you if need be."
Sophomore,4,"The nursing program is tough but I feel confident that the strictness prepares the students to be successful on the state exam and on the job site. I entered the program as a bridge student. It would’ve been helpful to have a more detailed orientation to the program and of other different caveats (clinicals, paperwork expectations)."
Sophomore,4,Better Parking. Parking is not good. I believe it is dangerous at night if you do not park with their shuttles. It is difficult to find parking around the campus. The campus overall is excellent. The teachers help you if you need it. You have to stay on top of all your work to stay ahead and not get behind.
Freshman,4,"Trocaire is a very nice school, but there are no sports and you feel like you don't get the whole college experience you look forward to."
Freshman,4,From the moment I walked in and visited the college I felt like I had nothing but support behind me. The teachers and other student made me feel like i belong there. Nothing but smiles and positive vibes soon as you walk in the door.
Freshman,4,"Good for adult students who are here to get their degree and get out into their work field. Would not recommend for young students looking for the ""college experience."" Healthcare College."
Sophomore,4,"I love trocaire, and my teachers. My teachers really love their job, and really spend the time so you understand the concepts of every lesson whether it is on cancer or high blood pressure. The clinicals are unorganized that is what I would change."
Freshman,4,Trocaire College is the most affordable private college with a good reputation especially in the nursing field. Class sizes are small and this enhances one on one learning environment. it's affiliate to huge catholic health hospital which is just 3 minutes walking distances giving students an opportunity to for internships and eventually gainful employement
Freshman,4,I enjoy attending college here. It is a nice school with small class sizes. The tuition is expensive and  Its pricey but I do think that you are only taking the classes required.
Freshman,4,"Trocaire is  a small, career driven school. Great school to attend to get the preparation needed for your career after graduation. So many resources available to help you succeed. A bit pricey, but worth the education attained here."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love this college! I am in the nursing program and love it so much because it is small and very student centered. They truly care about you and your grades not just on spitting a bunch of material at you. They start clinical in your first semester which is super helpful and they guide you in every aspect of your education. The only things I would change is the fact they don't have a student parking lot so you park on the street and walk, and that there is no sports, but other than that the school is perfection for me."
College Junior,4,"I've honestly never had any frustrations with anything, besides studying a lot. It was very easy to transfer credits from the previous college I attended."
College Junior,4,The quality of the career center is tip top. I already know I'll have a workplace to use my degree in.
College Junior,4,"With the courses that I have taken so far, I am very pleased with the knowledge they all have, and the willingness to help me and other students with studies. There are so many different courses you can take, at night, daytime, and even weekends. All of my classes so far are small, it's great."
College Junior,4,"The quality of career service is wonderful. I cannot wait until I graduate, because I know that's when I'll be able to put my medical mind to work."
College Junior,4,"Don't get me wrong, nursing school is tough, but very worth it in the long run if you are dedicated. My workload is pretty heavy, but I get so much help throughout. All of my professors have been so understanding so far. I know I will have a job as soon as I walk out of there with my degree."
College Junior,4,"I've always wanted to get into the medical field, and every time I would bring that up in a conversation, I was always told to go to Trocaire. I'm very happy I took everyone's advice and enrolled. All staff is so helpful there, and they really make me feel like I am going to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"The hybrid courses are more convenient than in class courses. The professors allow more than enough time to complete each assignment. The professors always reply with a speedy response. If there are technical errors, they are extremely understanding and will direct you to the technical support office. Most professors will even extend the assignment submission date."
College Sophomore,4,The career center is a great place to get help with finding a job that best suits you. People are always available to help with any questions. You can find the moist help at the main campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I am in the Healthcare Informatics program, this is still new to the school. I like how most of my professors work in the profession that I am majoring in. I can ask them real life questions about my program and courses. My program also offers weekends courses which was a little odd at first , but is very beneficial to a lot of moms in my program. he workload is bearable. The professors really work hard to make sure each student is understanding the courses. Most of my courses are held at the Transit location. It is a really nice area and there is plenty of parking at this location."
College Senior,4,Very great school the only downfalls are tuition is very pricey and there is no parking lot.
College Junior,4,I enjoy Trocaire College. It has a great reputation for Nursing
College Senior,4,There is a wide diverse study body. I do really enjoy how small the school setting is.
College Senior,4,Placement was very helpful for job opportunities.
College Senior,4,Lots of diversity mostly all plesent and nice.
College Freshman,4,"Trocaire makes a point of placing students in degree related internships during their final year. Invaluable for gaining actual work experience, internships open the door to professional networking as well."
College Freshman,4,I appreciate that Trocaire's professors are mostly professionals sharing their real world experise.
College Senior,4,It's an old school with some updates.  The library is fanstastic.  There are many opportunities for students to participate in activities.
College Senior,4,"After 3 semesters, I love Trocaire.  It's been a fantastic, tough, but rewarding experience.  I love the very slight religous aspect of the college (Catholic) with a group of nuns still working at the school."
College Senior,4,"a few initial glitches but overall, they are very easy to work with."
College Senior,4,Great representation of student body with a very diverse population.
College Senior,4,Very easy to use and manage.  Love the online courses for the required courses outside of the core nursing courses.
College Senior,4,The nursing program is structured and sequenstial.  You know exactly what classes you will be taking each semester.
College Senior,4,From what I know - the services offered are great.
College Sophomore,4,The work load is heavy and hard but its worth it.  They want you to do well.
College Sophomore,4,They help you in every way possible.  What ever you need if they can they will help you in every way possible. With all your financial situation
College Sophomore,4,We have alot of Arabic students. They are great friendly.  They say hello and hope you have good grades.
College Sophomore,4,There is a hospital wing in which Annie dolls lay on beds in rooms and hallways waiting to be diagnosed and worked on by the nursing staff. This in turn gives us the best experience with the technical operations required to work on human patients.
College Junior,4,"Very friendly atmosphere, course availability is great. The availability of evening programs is very good"
College Junior,4,This was one of the only schools in my area with an evening program.
College Junior,4,Parking is awful but the campus itself is beautiful and easy to navigate
College Junior,4,"I work full time during the day, the classes are all flexible and the school is accommodating to my needs."
College Student,4,I feel I am obtaining a degree that will teach me valuable skills for my new career.
College Student,4,The Computer Networking program is relatively unique in it's focus on hands-on learning. They are also innovative in their Health Informatics program. There is a wide range of students in age and background. Many faculty are industry professionals.
College Student,4,I prefer on campus classes but the online course allowed me to take on full time status as I did not want to be out 3 evenings as I still have 3 children home. The professor is responsive and will actually have a few on campus meetings.
College Junior,4,Personally I have never taken any online courses yet. However from what I hear in my friends classes they sound pretty good. I actually want to go to Trocaire for my Bachelor's Degree because their courses are all online. 
College Junior,4,Well for the most part all the students at Trocaire are very focused on their future career. The students work very hard and the small school size allows for easy group study  
College Sophomore,4,"When I went back to school I was scared. I had not been in school for fifteen years. But between the staff and students at Trocaire, they made it a simple transition. "
College Sophomore,4,There are computer labs in the library and printing is free to students. Anything you need to print. The computers are easy to use and are up to date technology. 
Junior,2,"Very disorganized. Sure, they are accredited but they need to really get their act together. It seems like the programs don’t really know what they are doing or don’t have a plan of what to teach."
College Senior,2,"School  has a hard grading  system, and overly expensive"
College Senior,2,"There grading system  is different  from Newyork States .They are really expensive,  and if you fail 2 classes in a semester  you get kicked out of Nursing  for 5 years"
College Junior,2,"way to much work that can be done in one week, need to buy extra online programs along with buying the class."
College Junior,2,not many pass the boards
College Junior,2,"Horrible. Very unfair. The teachers pick their favorites, I am not tought well."
College Junior,2,"I have had many problems with this school. The teachers are below average, their are hidden fee's in the tuition that you are not told until your statement comes out, all they want is you money, I pay to much money to not have a parking lot, we have to pay to park in the ramp at mercy hospital which isn't fair, I teach myself more then I am tought. Once you start bachelor classes, trocaire does not let you transfe them out to another school."
College Sophomore,2,"I have had a wonderful experience with certain professors, whom I have taken due to rumors about their teaching quality. Others I have had the worst experience with, especially when it comes to understanding the criteria and asking for help."
College Junior,2,"This school is not flexible at all with nursing degree. clinicals are the same days, which really is awful for myself because i work full time, and they do not offer other days to go to clinicals. I've had to change my work days which i never wanted to do. Then the other classes have very few days and hours that are offered to take them."
College Junior,2,there is mostly females that attend school and we all know that females are not very friendly even though i am a female when there is 40-50 of us in a class it gets a little nasty i do not find it that diverse
College Junior,2,Why Do They Have a Office – I do not feel the education i am recieving is worth almost 9000 when i can go to a more accredited school and recieve a better education foro the same if not less they would not even assist me in finding a bank to attempted to cover my tuition because they are not aloud but they want every bit of my 9000
College Sophomore,2,"No Parking – the campus is nice for being downtown, however there is no parking! you have to park down the street or in a parking lot around the corner and take a shuttle"
Alum,1,"I graduated from Trocaire College in May of 2018 with a degree in Radiologic Technology. At the time I entered the school, the program had a great reputation. My class was the first class where they took on almost twice as many students. This meant they had to cut the clinic time in half for us because they no longer had enough sites to place us at. The long time director knew this would have negative consequences for the students and for the field, and because she opposed this, she was fired. After that things really started to deteriorate and a couple long time teachers began their exit. I felt like a guinea pig for almost two years. There was an extreme lack of leadership and many students came out unprepared due to not having enough clinic time. The only real message Trocaire College gave me is that they ONLY care about money. Go to a community college where you'll pay 1/3 the price. Save yourself the trouble."
College Sophomore,1,The workload of the Nursing program is outrageous. Not only do the professors expect the best from you but they also expect you to know and learn this criteria without a teacher so you have no guidance. The facility is wonderful other than the fact that we do not have a parking lot and have to fight for parking spots.

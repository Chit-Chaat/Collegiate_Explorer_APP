Freshman,5,"I really love Hampshire because it is the only school I feel like I could survive in. The college is so accepting and constantly working to makes room for every minority group. I am an agender person and the health services helped me get on testosterone quickly and were understanding of the trauma that comes with gender dysphoria. It was easy to make friends and the faculty are respectful of pronouns and from what friends of color say, Hampshire is  a pretty safe space for them in comparison to most of the US. The classes vary in difficulty but the professor, TAs and other faculty are good at checking up to see if anyone needs help with the work. The disabilities on campus organization advocates for divergent thinkers and those with mental illnesses which is very helpful for me. The campus is placed by a mountain and has dozens of hiking trails that help to clear the mind. The food is organic for the most part and there are always vegan options though the quality isn't so great."
Sophomore,5,Hampshire is very diverse and accepts students from all over the U.S. and the world. They have very open minds and are always ready to critically think on different positions academically and personally.
Alum,5,"Hampshire College is not for the faint of heart.  I was a shrinking violet in high school and wanted to push myself by going somewhere that would force me to develop the skills to self-advocate, direct my learning, and move beyond my comfort zone. Little did I know that Hampshire would be such a perfect outlet for doing all of these things; with a self-designed curriculum, project-based learning, and a mandatory capstone project of your own design, Hampshire is a place where you develop both the hard and soft skills required of being a critical thinker and doer. You'll likely find that students hold both an overwhelming affection and healthy skepticism for all things Hampshire, and I think that this student body (as well as a marvelous faculty) is exactly what makes it such an invaluable learning environment. Hampshire is currently in the financial throes and its fate is yet unknown; I sincerely hope it is able to survive, because there is no place in the world like Hampshire College."
Sophomore,5,Hampshire College is an awesome place to get a college education. With the help of the college staff you plan and execute your own curriculum. I like that it is a small college because there is more attention paid to students.
Junior,5,Hampshire College has continued to support me through my academic career. They made transferring from a community college both easy and natural. I've never felt more at home than I do at Hampshire.
Alum,5,"Hampshire College was a great experience for me academically and, although socially the school was not as diverse and integrated as I had hoped, I was able to get a fulfilling education at this institution."
Junior,5,"This school is really radical in every sense of the word and if you've done your research and you know what you're getting into, this school can and probably will change your life. I feel so ready for the world; I know how to advocate for myself and for others. I've spent so much time here collaborating with others and making things happen. It's a way harder school than the slacker stoner reputation would have you believe. To succeed here, you have to battle yourself and grow into who you want to be â€“ that's not easy, and it's something a lot of people never do. I am so grateful."
Sophomore,5,"Hampshire is an amazing opportunity for those who can handle challenging work, that they are for the most part completely in control of."
Alum,5,"I loved every moment at Hampshire, and what I learned there propelled me into a unique and selective career. Besides academics, Hampshire teaches students important skills for life: self-motivation, networking, creative problem-solving, and time management. 

Because class size is small, there is often competition to get into classes with popular teachers. It's frustrating to be rejected, but you will rarely attend a class with bored or inattentive students.

Hampshire is not for everyone. The progressive and alternative student body belies serious academic workloads, without many of the obvious guardrails of traditional academia. There are no tests at Hampshire. Instead, there are research papers, essays, and complicated lab reports, all of which are time-consuming and self-directed."
Junior,5,"Hampshire College has been a safe and supportive environment for me to explore my interests and find a way to combine them in order to constructing contribute to the community. With supportive professors who are willing to go above and beyond to support their students and a structure that allows students to be in control of their education while still being provided the support they need, Hampshire students are smart and highly motivated individuals. Hampshire College is not for everyone the lack of grade being supplemented with page long written evaluations for each class (with about 15 students) make you have to work harder, do all your work, show up to every class, participate and really form a working relationship with the professors. Hampshire is really what you make of it, working hard and advocate for yourself and you will get where you wanna go."
Freshman,5,It's a very close community that allows and supports you in pursuing what you are passionate about. It also gives its students an opportunity to try new activities and find new interests relatively easily.
Freshman,5,Hampshire is an innovative college that allows students to tailor their curriculum to meet their needs.
Freshman,5,"So far my experience with the application process to Hampshire College has been a breeze. The specific questions the asked on the CommonApp, as well as asking for an academic essay and allowing for students to submit original work demonstrate this college's devotion to an inclusive, caring environment."
Sophomore,5,"Hampshire College offers an experience like non-other. In a welcoming community of students sets to change the world you are able to find yourself. Learning which of the many of the world issues that you find passion in, and then begin to apply it to a positive change in society."
Freshman,5,I'm the happiest I've been in years here and count down the days until I get her go back when we'return on break so I think that says a lot.
College Junior,5,The professors here are great
College Sophomore,5,It's amazing! Engaged faculty and passionate students.
College Sophomore,5,"Oh my god I could (and do, that's why I work for admissions) go on for hours. I could never imagine going anywhere else. Hampshire's custom curricula, the great working/personal relationships with professors that you develop, the interesting and relevant academic work, are all just a few reasons why I love it.

Our Cognitive Science and Natural Science programs are some of the most unique and best programs for undergraduates anywhere. You do original (often publishable) research right out of the gate (potentially your first semester) at Hampshire. Your advisors/professors are your allies, and you get to know them really well and get really involved in their research."
College Sophomore,5,"Uhhhhh that's really binarist. (""Guys and girls"")

The dating scene is really queer/LGBTQIAP+/MOGAI and polyamorous friendly (honestly I'm friends with about 90% non-cisgender/straight/monogamous people.)

Like, for example... I'm genderqueer, use xe/xyr/xem pronouns, identify as pansexual and polyamorous.

I have 5 hampshire partners and most/all of them are varying forms of trans/genderqueer.

There are a wide variety of types of students as well... most of my friends/partners have aesthetic trends such as: punk, steampunk, hipster(?), hippie, farmer chic, really classy/high fashion, lo femme, theatre(???), traditional academic (???), goth, geeky, etc. But I hang out with a certain subset of people. There are a lot of more traditional and cis/straight students on campus as well. But if you're used to being the weird one, you'll fit fight in at Hampshire."
College Senior,5,Real music...woods parties and unbelievable. Also parties on Potwine (street perpendicular to campus) are generally good.
College Senior,5,"Hampshire's food as undergone a complete transformation. Saga has aimed to source 100% of its food locally (with the exception of tropical fruit and coffee). The majority of this foods comes from our on-campus organic farm, where students study, work, and eat."
College Senior,5,"Campus housing is not perfect, but the options are MILES better than other small liberal arts colleges. Having the option to live in on-campus apartments with full kitchens after your first year is a huge benefit. Great to gain experience with cooking/living with others early! The buildings themselves are mixed (Greenwich and Merrill are showing their age. Dakin, Enfield, and Prescott have all been recently renovated)."
College Freshman,5,The only time Hampshire has had any incident of violence was when there were drunken UMASS students here for a party.
College Freshman,5,There are a ton of great restaurants in Northampton and Amherst. Many cater to people with specialized eating. The only problem is both towns are fairly far from campus. Some delivery options though.
College Sophomore,5,"There are a lot of great options, including things that are affordable for the average student."
College Sophomore,5,"The area is great - there are five colleges, which makes the Amherst/Northampton area very student-friendly. Amherst is charming and Northampton is more metropolitan, providing for a great number of options and plenty of things to do."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus really isn't strict about things, but I still feel safe."
College Junior,5,"There are no programs! That's the best part of it. You completely create your own, unique program specific to you."
College Junior,5,"You can basically do anything you want. The overall rule is: don't hurt anyone else, and you're good."
College Junior,5,"The courses that we offer are phenomenal. I wish we offered double the amount of classes that we do, but our faculty is overworked anyway. Most of the professors do everything they can to guide their students in the right direction."
College Junior,5,"Imagine the weird kids at your highschool. Now imagine all of the weird kids from every highschool all came together at one place. That place is Hampshire. If you're okay with getting weird, then we're here to welcome you with open arms. Stay Weird."
College Senior,5,No difficulty.  Once you are accepted to Hampshire you begin on the same path as everyone else.  Only the creative writing and film programs require a specific application.
College Senior,5,"Hampshire students create their own course of study.  While there is a great deal of faculty advising in this process, it is best to be or become a self-motivated student.  Thankfully, that was a quality I gained from Critical Social Inquiry courses at Hampshire, which poked at questions I was really interested in.  Currently, my concentration in on Disaster Policy and Emergency Management.  My Div III will be investigating publics evacuation plans in coastal US cities.  Having such a specific concentration looks great to employers and graduate admissions committees."
College Senior,5,"Campus police is shared between Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges.  They are incredibly lenient and focus on safety rather than the law.  Never had a bad experience with them."
College Senior,5,"Connected by the PVTA (free) bus system, 5-College students (including Hampshire) can get around Amherst, Hadley, and Northampton with ease.  

The town of Amherst is very collegiate, looks like it could be straight out of a New England magazine.  Great place to study.  Northampton has a much more vibrant culture.  Lots of great music venues with big names, tons of cinemas, cafes, libraries, parks.  Hadley is full of box stores and chains.  A bit boring, but necessary."
College Senior,5,"After aid, Hampshire was the most affordable school from my list of 13 private and public schools.  My family's need is high, and Hampshire was able to meet 100% of it.  I will graduate with about $21,000 in debt, which is considerably lower than my peers at other schools."
College Sophomore,5,Consent is everything. No peer pressure.
College Sophomore,5,I get to design my own major. What more can I ask?
College Sophomore,5,I feel extremely safe. I am never worried.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus.
College Junior,5,"Hampshire is truly an incredible place. People really care at Hampshire, and will be there for you if you need anything. You will certainly learn a lot here, engage in incredible and intellectually stimulating discussions, and have the time of your time."
College Junior,5,The Academics at Hampshire are selected. They include things like constant close interactions with faculty members and critical thinking. One of the best parts is a one year long project based on a master thesis called Div III. The quality of the work produced during that year is equivalent to graduate level work. This experience makes it very easy for Hampshire students to get to top rated graduate schools.
College Sophomore,5,"The substance scene is pretty darn good.  The price for marijuana is very reasonable. We see a variety of strains as well.    The smell of weed can get tiring sometimes.  Smoking joints is a common occurrence and faculty do not mind.  I also have friends that use marijuana for medicinal purposes.  At this day in age if you are put off by marijuana then shame on you.

As far as harder drugs they are here. If you are the type to partake then go head.    You can drink in your dorms with little worry.  If you have an open can outside and you run into campo they will ask you to pour it out.      It is also worth noting we have little peer pressure.     In all, it is a healthy scene here."
College Sophomore,5,"I LOVE Amherst and Northampton. I go to Amherst for the coffee shops and restaurants. I go to Northampton to walk around downtown, grab a bite to eat, get coffee, go to music venues, and go shopping. The atmosphere of both is so lively and welcoming, there's always something going on (especially with so many colleges in the area). Everyone I've met is very friendly and helpful towards students (since we're a majority of their business) and a lot of them actually employ student workers. There's also an indoor soccer league in Northampton I'm a part of."
College Sophomore,5,"Hampshire parties have great DJs. Enfield has the best parties because they have the largest common spaces (whereas Greenwich parties are more cramped because the living rooms in Greenwich are smaller) and therefore more of a dance floor. You can also go off campus to parties at any of the other schools. On weekends, the buses run until about 2am, so you'll have a safe, free way to get home. There are also several bars for people 21 and up."
College Sophomore,5,"There are 1,400 students at Hampshire and 1,400 majors. Everyone's major is what they want it to be. I came in studying Creative Writing and at the beginning of my second year I decided I wanted to look at ways people communication with one another. The transition was easy because that's the way Hampshire is set up.

There are some areas of study that tons of people are interested in, such as Creative Writing, Film/Video, and Theater. Those classes can be harder to get in to, but there are so many extracurriculars you can get involved with that a lot of your education happens outside of the classroom. One of the guys I live with is in two film courses this semester, but has worked on six different people's independent projects. Same goes for theater folks; there are at least three dozen plays on campus over the course of a school year."
College Sophomore,5,"I guess this questions is hard to answer because my specific program at Hampshire is specific to just me. I get to choose my classes and demonstrate how they relate to what I'm studying. There's no cookie-cutter requirements I have to fulfill. If I want to take a class and I think it will further my education, I will. And my advising committee will be there to suggest classes, different paths I could take, and to point out possible road blocks in my curriculum.

One of my favorite parts of my program (and all Hampshire's programs) is that the school doesn't just include academic courses as being a part of your education. They look at the extracurriculars you're involved in that relate to what you're studying and the different independent projects you've taken on and see all of that as a part of your education, too."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Hampshire. I actually wish I could attend over and over and over again because there are so many things I'm interested in and not enough time to do them all! I love being on the soccer, basketball, and Ultimate frisbee team. I also love the entire OPRA staff and program.

The professors here are so accessible to students. They're always there to help and meet with you, and they're open to altering assignments based on your ideas, suggestions, and visions. For a final paper in one my literature classes my professor let me write a short story in place of the research essay because I wanted to explore different character voices. It was such a great learning experience. In general, actually, I've never done so much writing and it is making me not only a better writer, but a better learner; I'm discovering how to make things clearer to audiences, what questions are intriguing to ask, and how to do in-depth readings of texts.

Getting narrative evaluations over grades is so much more helpful. I'm able to see point by point what I need to work on and possible ways to improve myself, as well as looking at what I do well. There's no competition amongst peers because we're not gauging one another based on numbers, but there is a great internal competition against yourself to work harder and harder on what you're passionate about.

The 5 College Consortium is a wonderful resource. Not only are there over 5,000 classes to choose from, but you get to experience different campus cultures and meet SO many different students."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the PVTA Bus System. It's free for students and takes you into town, the four surrounding colleges, to the theater, to grocery stores... I think it's incredibly convenient and reliable, especially when I compare it to MARTA back home in Decatur, Georgia. The PVTA can also get you to bus and train stops that will take you further, such as out of state.

There's a shuttle that can take you to the airport called Valley Transporter. I can always find someone willing to drive me to the Hartford Airport though. It's just a 40 minute drive and if you offer gas money or food someone's game. You just have to post on the Facebook page or the Student Daily Digest e-blast that goes out."
College Sophomore,5,"While Hampshire doesn't have a very high percentage of Students of Color or International Students (when you look at the percentages), it'd be absurd to say it wasn't an accepting environment. I feel like Hampshire is one of the most liberal, open-to-everything campuses in the country. Sexuality is discussed freely amongst students and nothing is held against anyone for simply being who they are. We introduce ourselves with our preferred names and what pronouns we use. There's a Spiritual Center for students of all denominations to visit and use, and there are also some religious-based student groups. We also have a Multicultural Center where tons of students spend time just hanging out."
College Sophomore,5,"Living between two college towns - Amherst and Northampton - is AMAZING! There are endless food options. I can get pizza by the slice, Greek food, sushi, burritos, diner food, Moroccan, frozen yogurt -- whatever I want. Hampshire doesn't have an off-campus meal plan set up or anything, but a lot of the restaurants in the area know they're catering to college students so their prices are very reasonable. Since the buses take you straight into downtown Amherst and Northampton, it's super easy to access food. Also, loads of places deliver to campus, and if they don't deliver themselves, students can use Delivery Express to have it brought right to their door.

I suggest going to The Black Sheep Cafe, Oriental Flavor, and the Route 9 Diner in Amherst and Pinocchio's Pizza, Bueno y Sano, and Rao's Coffee in Northampton."
College Freshman,5,I am 100% confident that I will be able to acheive my goals and find success and that Hampshire will help me do that.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love NS and the faculty I work with. I feel motivated, inspired, and well cared-for. The curriculum is challenging and rewarding."
College Freshman,5,I love studying Natural Medicine at Hampshire - I get to focus on research in my field while fulfilling basic pre-med requirements!
College Freshman,5,"My dad does the networking, so I love it! He's very good at what he does. Just call him if you have a problem. :)"
College Freshman,5,"It's a small college population and a huge campus, so there's a lot of parking available. "
College Freshman,5,"The Academics are very flexible and the college offers a lot of unique courses. There's a lot of reading and essays writing. The Facilities haven't really been updated since the college was built, though."
College Freshman,5,"Even as first year students, you take classes that interest you. You're not forced to take General Biology or English 101. It really opens your mind up to different areas of knowledge and is very valuable."
College Freshman,5,"The buildings are old, but they are not unlivable. Most people live in single rooms, which most people value. It's not as sociable as would be expected, since there is no real social center on campus, but it's not impossible to find friends. "
College Freshman,5,"There is one main dining hall and then a small cafe. The food provider is really into healthy, made-from-scratch meals, which is awesome. They focus on buying local food and even use the vegetables from the campus farm. There aren't a ton of options, but you can always find something to eat. It's a small sacrifice to be made in order to have food that is healthy and fresh. "
Freshman,4,"Zoom sucks but the teachers are trying their best to make it as tolerable as possible. I definitely prefer in person learning but this is better than mu high school learning experience. The faculty are always looking for more ways to make the classes lively and easy to participate in. It's pretty easy for me to learn when it comes to more conceptual learning like writing and science but as for math-ish type learning it's very difficult for me. But honestly, I don't know that there is any way to make online learning as fun or easy as in person learning."
Sophomore,4,Hampshire has a very unique and engaging academic system.  There are no grades and tests which enables students to genuinely learn instead of memorizing information for tests.  Learning is project based and encourages students to engage in their classes.
Freshman,4,"Hampshire College provides a unique 4 year experience. With less requirements than other private liberal arts college, the student is allowed to explore multiple paths during their first year. Students are encouraged to take a variety of courses and practice outside of the classroom to better themselves in their practice."
Freshman,4,"With committed professors and a driven student body, this school has helped me improve. The self-directed nature of the curriculum is definitely not for everyone but it has really worked for me. I've been engrossed in my field of study even in my first year and I've received guidance to complete independent projects. The small campus can feel a little oppressive but there is a lot of community emphasis and lots of forest to explore. This school is near four other colleges and the network formed between the five colleges is astounding. Dining hall food is diverse and inclusive, but often greasy or bland. Housing assignments were thorough, dorms are small."
Junior,4,"Flexible independent learning structure is a plus, but you have to make it work- if you don't take advantage of the situation then you won't get anything out of it. Most professors are great, it's easy to build a relationship with them, but the administration is terrible. People often rag on Hampshire but that's because there are an unfortunate amount of drop-outs and people who come here thinking that they can get away with anything. The people who actually put their work in and make Hampshire work for them are highly successful and respected by grad schools and the other colleges."
Niche User,4,"I have not attended this school as I am a high school senior, but I have visited Hampshire and I liked it a lot."
Junior,4,"To start, I have to say that there is really no place in the world exactly like Hampshire College, and I have no regrets about attending. The school structure has really allowed me to grow as a student, and to find the right career path for me. My writing and networking skills have grown immensely. The campus is charming, and I have free bus access to 5 other schools (and their libraries and resources). Experimental/alternative schools often lack library resources and experts on a multitude of subjects, so consortium access is a major bonus.

There are definitely things I would like to see changed here. I dislike the meal plan and dining hours. Health services is inconvenient and understaffed. The rural area can at times create a campus ""bubble"" that is unhealthy and volatile (I use the consortium to compensate for this). However, none of these inconveniences are significant enough to make me regret my decision, or make me consider transferring."
Senior,4,"They gave me a fully funded scholarship because I was one of the many Puerto Ricans displaced by the impact of the Hurricane Maria. I wish I could see more of those scholarships be handed out to the people of my country because there has been a very difficult political climate there, austerity measures in the public and private sector, as well as budget cuts to education programs and the closing of many schools."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the openness of Hampshire College yet I feel as if it could be more accepting and more open for disabled students.
Junior,4,"I love that you get to choose your own path and select courses that best fit into your specified area of study. I appreciate the theatre program and how it is run by students. I am grateful for all the opportunities I have had in the theatre program, ones which I never would have gotten had I attended any other institution."
Freshman,4,Hampshire college is unlike any college I have ever heard of. I was surprised at how connected the students are with the professors. The disconnect you often feel when shoved into a class with hundreds of other students is simply not there. The small classes allow the professor and student to engage with other. This allows the professor to aid the student however possible.
Freshman,4,"The classes when you can find relevant ones are really good, and faculty is willing to work with students. If you have allergies, do everything in your power to get off the full meal plan, because it won't do you much good anyway."
Niche User,4,"Hampshire College is a private liberal arts college in Amherst, Massachusetts, United States. It was opened in 1970 as an experiment in alternative education, in association with four other colleges in the Pioneer Valley: Amherst College, Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Together they are now known as the Five Colleges, or the Five College Consortium."
Junior,4,"So far, I have really enjoyed my time here at Hampshire College. All of my professors have gone out of their way to help me with my academics. Also, Hampshire has one of the most caring and social justice motivated students body I have ever met."
Freshman,4,"For sure take a class with Will Ryan and Dr. Laura Greenfield. They will change your life. Very active beautiful minds at this school. Very liberal arts PC call out culture so be ready to learn and be humble. Beautiful campus. I wouldn't come here to brag or for compitition or for nice buildings but if you want intellectual stimulation like no other, caring people, to be challanged, and the adventure of a lifetime in a weird hippie place Hampshire is for you!"
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I'm happy with my choice to go to Hampshire. I have loved almost all of my professors and I actually get to talk to them because the college and class sizes are so small. I am able to design my own major, study whatever I want, even if there aren't classes about it, and take advantage of the immense resources of UMass Amherst without having to go to a gigantic school. However, every year it gets more and more expensive,  I'm not allowed to live off campus, and the food isn't the best."
Freshman,4,"Hampshire College has a wonderful campus in a beautiful area of Massachusetts. The academic system is unique and provides immense flexibility. You have access to Amherst, UMASS Amherst, Mt Holyoke, and Smith classes as well."
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are small, allowing for easy access to professors and great class discussion."
College Freshman,4,"The professors have a plethora of connections. As well, CORC offers guidance and resources for planning for the future. Hampshire graduates tend to have an entreaupreneural spirit."
College Freshman,4,"The one thing that is really great about living at Hampshire is that most students live in a single their first year of college. Hampshire also has on-campus housing, called mods, that are cute and cheaper to live in since you don't have to pay for a meal plan."
College Freshman,4,We have campus police 24/7 so it's nice to know they are near all times. I have seen them in a few social events in order to try to connect to students so that is very nice. They're friendly and approachable.
College Freshman,4,"Courses are great, however, since some of them are unique, it is a bit tricky to find the right ones, however the 5 college thing helps. Professors tend to be very helpful and supportive. A lot of classes tend to be discussion based, so PLEASE speak in class."
College Freshman,4,"Hampshire College is a great school if you're honestly good at doing interdisciplinary work, that's how you'll best take advantage of the school. I love the clubs that form, depending on which ones you go to, you'll find friends. Financially, this school is a bit hard to afford, definitely recomend getting a job or scholarships! Beautiful setting, and great people."
College Freshman,4,"Hampshire has a very strong social justice culture. Most of the time, this is very positive. Sometimes it is less so."
College Freshman,4,"great student body, with teachers who actually care."
College Freshman,4,Everything has been great so far in terms of safety.
College Freshman,4,The courses available and that I attended were great. I was able to adjust to specific classroom settings. The professors I had were all very helpful but could be more approachable.
College Freshman,4,This rating is specifically for the alum network since I had the chance to work with it.
College Freshman,4,It is a real fun experience living on campus. I am able to bond with a lot of my hall mates and it is easier getting together for group projects.
College Freshman,4,To know is not enough
College Senior,4,"Hampshire College is a unique and innovative academic environment. I have been fortunate to be guided by adivisors from my first year onward. Unfortunately many of them have left. At first it was difficult, but it forced me to reach out the the 5 Colleges in the area. This was the best experience for me as I reached out to incredible professors in the area and  I now work in both a morality lab and social cognition lab at Umass, while conducting my own ERP neuroscience research at Hampshire. I was able to take many courses at Umass, Smith, Mt Holyoke and Hampshire. I would choose it over and over again as it helped me learn independently while giving me access to the resources I needed to conduct my indpendent research."
College Sophomore,4,"During my college search I knew what type of school I wanted to go to immediately. I was looking for a small liberal arts college with a great academic program and vibrant student life while having understanding and helpful professors, not to mention great financial aid. Now this all sounds too good to be true, a prospective students wet dream, but I found these schools with lots of research. Hampshire College was one of the many schools I applied to (and ended up going to) that had all those requirements and more. Sure out of all the schools Hampshire gave me an outstanding amount of financial aid (with only a small amount of the money given being loans); but it was the little things like and a majority single dorm rooms that helped me make my decision to go. While there are a few things I have a problem with, my life on campus academically and socially have been wonderful. I would describe Hampshire College to be a place where you can feel your voice being heard."
College Sophomore,4,Campus police doesn't care about much. Most things in the way of drugs and drinking go here. It's hard to get in trouble with campo. It's not so hard to get in trouble in classes.
College Sophomore,4,"If you aren't one for the traditional frat party, you'll like Hampshire parties. Mario Kart/Smash Bros. parties on the sub-free halls are great too."
College Sophomore,4,"I've had two jobs on campus, as a Lab Assistant for the school of Natural Science and as an Admissions Intern. Both are fun and challenging but fairly relaxed and comfortable, with decent pay! ($9/hr) 

I have also been a TA, and that was really unique and rewarding."
College Sophomore,4,"In general, the structure of the school and the administration are very flexible. If you want to do something, you can pretty much always find a way to make it happen. Don't be afraid to customize your academic program and make changes in the structure of the school! If someone tells you it can't be done, just ask someone else until you find someone willing to support you."
College Senior,4,Challenging..100% reading and writing based. No tests or grades.
College Senior,4,There have certainly been a number of known sexual assaults on Hampshire's campus during my time here. I have heard mixed options on how the college handles these claims. Hampshire's higher-than-expected per capita number of sexual assaults on campus is due to 1. have such a small population of students (less than 1300) and 2. survivors of sexual assault are given the resources and support to make claims instead of suppressing their trauma.
College Senior,4,"Academics are rigorous. VERY reading and writing intensive, but there is support to get new students up to speed and prepared."
College Freshman,4,"Education is great here, its what you make of it."
College Freshman,4,"Hampshire is great when it comes to education. It really is what you make it. It can be fantastic or really bad, it just depends on the person and their work ethic."
College Freshman,4,"They often lose paperwork and are not the most organized but they give great financial aid. I still have to struggle to find a way to pay for the rest but overall, they have it together."
College Freshman,4,"I have a single room that is a decent size. And from my experience, most students get to live where they want to."
College Freshman,4,Hampshire has a decent balance of strictness and leniency.
College Freshman,4,"Most rooms are singles. Fairly nice and modern. Kept clean, although not that clean."
College Freshman,4,"There are lots of good restaurants. Because there are five major colleges in the vicinity of the towns, most of the businesses are student-centered."
College Freshman,4,I'm an athlete. There are very few sports on campus but I think the fan support and facilities are pretty great considering.
College Senior,4,Many people enjoy living off campus as the cost is significantly less than on campus and there are great places available
College Senior,4,"Professors are involved with students, the small class size is great, workload is totally manageable, and there are many many opportunities for independent studies."
College Senior,4,"The five college area has lots of atmosphere, it is small town but vibrant."
College Sophomore,4,"It's fine, and reportedly improved quite a lot. Sometimes the eating options can be redundant, but it's never terrible, and there are always vegan/vegetarian options available."
College Sophomore,4,"I come from a very conservative, ethnically-white area, so the racial and religious diversity at Hampshire is definitely refreshing. However, political diversity is nonexistent, and it's rare to find someone who isn't liberal (they may exist, but if they do, they're hiding). We are a very LGBT-friendly school, however, and also house a wide variety of eccentrics, oddballs, and intellects."
College Sophomore,4,"Some of my friends have complained that there are not enough classes for their field, but as a Psychology/English concentration I definitely haven't had that problem. My adviser was really helpful, I love Hampshire's individualized curriculum, and it's really helped me understand my field from multiple perspectives. I'm so grateful for the educational experiences that I've had since coming here."
College Sophomore,4,I don't life off-campus but I have heard positive things from friends who do.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms aren't great, but they're mostly singles. Some are better than others. People are generally friendly."
College Junior,4,"There is always someone on campus trying to get the word out to students about a new job or internship opportunity. Also, if you don't find anything you like on campus, you can easily go to any of the other 5 colleges to find what you need."
College Junior,4,Everyone works really hard to accept people regardless of their beliefs or background.
College Senior,4,"Most students, about 90%, choose to live in campus for all four years.  Those who move off campus are usually Division III students in their final year who need extra quiet study space.  Rates tend to be rather steep off campus due to there being four other colleges in the area."
College Senior,4,"Unfortunately, Hampshire (and most other colleges in the US) remain inaccessible to students of color.  There are a number of scholarships and other aid for international students and students of color, but those programs could certainly go much further.

Politically, Hampshire is a leftist campus.  This should be of no surprise.  Not aggressively liberal, but students will call you out if they don't agree with you.  Be ready to defend your conservatism if that's your thing."
College Senior,4,"I have been really happy with my decision to come to Hampshire.  In professional settings, I feel as if I'm among the only person in a group who is willing to think critically about projects or decisions that have been made.  Hampshire teaches you to take a problem, no matter how large, and break it down bit by bit until the solution is digestible.  

No tests and no grade does NOT mean no work.  In fact, its very much the opposite.  I've received A's in all 7 of my Smith courses, which I took through the Consortium.  Hampshire is to thank for improvement in my writing, which is the most important skill you can take into the job market or grad school.  The only reason I didn't give Hampshire a perfect score is because it is such a young school (est in 1970) and there is always room for students to change campus for the better."
Junior,2,This school advertises an alternative to higher education yet the benefits that you can reap from designing your own major and doing independent research can be obtained at any other higher institution.
College Freshman,2,"There are few teams at Hampshire. The gym facilities are okay, but are shared with the community at large as part of a multisport complex."
College Junior,2,My school doesn't really do sports.
College Freshman,2,"The athletics aren't taken seriously and receive little to know funding, which is pretty frustrating. "
College Freshman,2,"There's usually an on-campus party somewhere every day thursday-sunday, but really only fun if drunk or high."
College Freshman,2,"While there's a lot of diversity when it comes to ethnicity and sexual orientation, but as far as economic background and political beliefs, it's pretty one-sides: super liberal and upper to upper-middle class. "
College Freshman,2,"There are only a handful of Division III teams, and they are not taken too seriously. Most people play Frisbee or swim just for the fun of it, no one joins a team. Plus, the few Division III teams that there are aren't very good."
College Sophomore,2,"The bus is free and it comes about every 45 minutes but it'll take you about a half hour to get anywhere that resembles a town. The bus is free if you have your student ID but the buses stop running at 11PM so it is not an ideal mode to get to an off campus party. There are zip cars that you can go in on but owning a car makes getting groceries and going out much, much easier."
College Senior,2,"Most are pretty self-involved and can be cliquey. Everyone has their own style, some work and some don't. They're interesting if nothing else."
College Freshman,2,"The weather is great in the early fall and spring, it's sunny and beautiful. But if you're not a fan of cold, rain, and snow, then the winter is going to suck for you. It gets cold starting in October and stays that way until at least the end of March, usually longer."
College Student,2,"Saga is the singular dining hall, run by Sodexo. The bridge cafe is a little better and money on your i.d. for the bridge is included in tuition.
You can usually find something at Saga, whether it's the salad bar or cereal, which was usually what I went for. Once you're out of the dorms, you have the option of going off the meal plan and navigating groceries.
Atkins is also nearby, though kind of expensive."
College Freshman,2,"I don't live on campus, but from what I've seen they're nice enough - standard dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"The facilities are perfectly adequate and fulfill everyone's needs. People like to complain, but for no reason but that people like to complain. Hampshire isn't into fancy things, and shouldn't be. It isn't us. We don't have much money, and that money should be focused on financial aid and sustainable investments.  I love living here- everyone can have a single if they want it and things are usually clean and safe, warm and friendly. The staff members are all amazing. We aren't into chandeliers and, though we can be stricken with jealousy when we walk around wealthier institutions, we wouldn't take them if you gave them to us. The real life of the school here is cerebral."
College Sophomore,2,"The major is not offered in this school, so I have to take majority of my classes off campus, and this is made possible by the Five college consortium that allows one to take classes from the other 4 different campuses.  However, it can be challenging moving from campus to campus and also managing to balance your class work properly."
College Freshman,2,"There is public transportation available and you can definitely get around, if you want to, but the busses only come once every half-hour, and there is no easy way to get to the Hampshire mall."
College Freshman,2,Dorm buildings are dirty and always smell like pot. Mods are infested with mold.
College Sophomore,2,"Complaining About SAGA a Normal Part of Social Life â€“ Hampshire students don't have that much to complain about, so the need to bond over mutual suffering tends to be expressed at the dining hall. It is ubiquitously referred to as ""SAGA"" after the last food service provider, though it is now run by the much despised company Sodexo (which, as students would be quick to inform you, also provides food for many prisons, is suspected of putting laxatives in food, and, if rumor would have it, is conspiratorially immoral in every way.) The food isn't nearly as bad as we like to act. Some dishes are great. But you might surely find yourself shaking your head in knowing disapproval at the cost of your meal plan (unfairly mandatory for freshman), the chipper tour-guides doing their best to convince unknowing high-schoolers of the splendid feasts ahead of them, and, on many occasions, your own plate of eerily similar-tasting ladlefuls. Also, the coffee is despairingly weak.
on the other hand:
-Roberta, who swipes students in, is one of the most delightful and most-loved characters on campus, and has been since the college was founded.
-unlimited hot meals should not be so underappreciated.
-the ice-cream selection is wonderful. 
-you can make healthy, tasty meals easily if you take time to use the microwave, the wok, the salad bar, and a little creativity.
-All other food options at hampshire, like The Bridge Cafe, the Night Truck, the elusive Waffle Truck, and Mixed Nuts, are wonderful.
-Dining hall food is just part of the freshman experience."
College Freshman,2,"Brutalist Style Architecture â€“ Hampshire has a BEAUTIFUL location, but we suffer no delusions about our facilities. The surrounding mountains and landscape make the school aesthetically pleasing, but our buildings do not. The 70's architecture is unfortunate, and many of the buildings are designed in peculiarly counterintuitive ways (especially the library). We don't really have a student center, although we may have one by next year."
College Senior,2,Amherst is an okay town but without an id you can't get into the bars. On campus the parties suck and are usually at the older kid's mods but not very fun.
College Senior,2,"Almost No Sports â€“ Aside from the girls' soccer team which is undefeated and the ultimate frisbee team, there are no other prominent sports teams on campus (at least none that i know of). we do have a rock climbing team and a gym but it simply is not an athletically focused school, though there are the resources for it (soccer field, work-out gym, basketball gym, rock climbing room, and a huge multisports center on campus)"
Recent Alumnus,1,"The demographics of the school were generally upper income East Coast students who had attended private or alternative high schools. My experience was that my peers were generally very poorly prepared for a rigorous college educational experience. They did not know the basics of math, history, humanities-- hence, the long lag in graduation times. I am now a teacher, and this group would have been more qualified for remedial adult education, such as GED instruction. I also worked in health care, and observed many of the same behaviors here that I saw in inpatient psychiatric units. Classes were not rigorous, compared to others I attended at the local universities with which Hampshire has co-op arrangements; in fact, my high school AP classes were far more demanding than Hampshire's. Sadly, most faculty did not raise the bar for these underprepared students, and the classes generally devolved into the same, tired screeds about race, gender, sexuality, etc--even if the class content had nothing to do with it. This was so often the case that it became pointless to attend class, as the class was not really run by the professor, but by the students, who had nothing new to say, but certainly demanded to say it again anyway"

As compared with the campuses I visited and attended classes at nearby, Hampshire was the most intolerant , elitist, hostile, and socially toxic"
College Freshman,1,"As a liberal arts school, it makes sense we dont have greek life."
College Freshman,1,"All I have to say is there aren't enough people of color on campus and that's a problem. Religion is looked down upon and I hate that because our school is all about expressing our individualities but nobody excepts people who come out with their religious preferences. We have this thing where we have to introduce ourselves with our gender pronouns and if you say anything negative about it, you're shamed for it but if you really think about it, referring to someone as ""they and them"" is grammatically incorrect but don't ever say that out loud unless you want to end up with no friends. Everybody's a hardass about things like having no water bottles or going against walmart or being a vegetarian or buying coca cola products and it's like oh my gosh, calm yourself. This school has too many liberals and nobody ever argues against them. Some people are really stuck up about social justice AND YES I GET WHY IT'S IMPORTANT BUT DAMN let me form my own opinions instead of yelling at me about why my life is such a waste."
College Sophomore,1,"Fast food is a treat in comparison to the garbage they serve in big trays. The menu is not very ""refreshing"" and repeats every month and a half. There are fruits, vegetables (the salad bar is good-ish), they have vegan and laxtose intolerant options, bagels and whatnot. Best combination that I've had is to make a panini, grab some salad, have a muffin from the vegan fridge for ""desert"", their yogurt is really sweet but their granola is decent. Bagels are usually stale but you can always toast em and smother them with toppings.

I can't stress enough how bad the food is here. Everyone complains here about SAGA because it's the one thing that we can all relate on: it is horrid. If you are substance free then you're going to have a much harder time eating there as most people get high or drunk before going to SAGA for a reason, you don't realize what you're eating until it's over.

Coffee is decent but only a portion of it is fair trade, there are vegetables that are from the area but that's not really important when they get their meet from slaughter houses in mid Mass.

The good side? After your first year, and if you land in a mod or live off campus, you don't have to eat that crap."
College Freshman,1,"Little variety, terrible quality, poor off-campus selections, almost everything is fatty and unhealthy, except for the salads"
Recent Alumnus,1,"The social atmosphere at Hampshire is extremely cliquey and makes getting to know new people difficult. A lot of the students here could be described at the typical pretentious hipster. If you don't do drugs, drink, or smoke, you'll be spending most nights alone in your dorm (good thing you have single dorms).  The buildings are ugly. Most of campus either smells like B.O., marijuana, or must. Co-ed halls are nice, but it makes keeping bathrooms clean impossible."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I can sum up the majority of students here in this simple anecdote: while waiting for the bus, a friend of mine saw a kid jump out of his Mercedes wearing grungy clothes and no shoes...Students are mostly white, upper class hipsters living in their own little bubble."
College Junior,1,A kid jumped out the window naked after doing drugs so you can judge how safe people feel in their own minds let a lone the campus..
College Freshman,1,"Be Prepared for Constant Drug Use â€“ Okay, okay, I know that Hampshire is the quintessential ""hippie"" school. So going into this, I knew there would be excessive amounts of marijuana, which there are. However, I was not prepared for the constant use of hard drugs. You will find students blatantly tripping acid and mushrooms at all hours of the day, regardless of the day of the week. Smoking opium, the drug HEROIN is made out of is also popular. Recently, some of my friends got into smoking opium [heroin] mixed with morphine. This isn't a school. It's a crack house. Really, if you don't like drugs, or even are comfortable with marijuana and recreational drug use, which I am and participate in on the weekends, think about the kind of environment you want to immerse yourself in. We are in the middle of the woods, so sitting around doing drugs is the activity of choice. It may sound nice for a while. It was. Now it is a waste of time and money. I'm leaving. kthanksbye. "

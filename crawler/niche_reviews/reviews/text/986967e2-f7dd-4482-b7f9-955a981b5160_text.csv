Senior,5,I have loved my experience at QUOC. Small class sizes lead to many unique opportunities. So grateful for the close relationships I made with my professors.
Senior,5,My professors were incredibly organized and quick to move online without disrupting my education. Was able to successfully finish my courses.
Junior,5,Queens University has always showed me care and compassion and is overall a wonderful school an di am lucky to be attending in the fall
Junior,5,"Amazing coaches and athletics department. Love the class sizes and professors actually take time to get to know you and want you to do well.  Very safe campus. Cafeteria and food selection is new and it’s good compared to other colleges that I’ve visited. The student population is a little over 1,000 but you get to know everyone - I didn’t think I would like that, but I really do now. I don’t have a problem parking my car. Some dorms are older, but I expected that. The newer dorms are super nice. The city can be expensive so staying on campus is your best bet!"
Sophomore,5,I love that Queens makes students feel like they are important and have a purpose. Professors want the best out of their students. I wish there was more opportunity for scholarships and aid though.
Niche User,5,Queens is a close college and they care for their students they take the time to know who you are and they dont judge your character they take note of your strengths and weaknesses and work to help you along the way.
Niche User,5,I visited Queens and am now committed to going there. I just really loved the environment and how everyone acts there. I really liked how their main focus is to help each and every student succeed during their time at Queens and how you have to complete Internships to graduate. I feel like I will become an extremely successful person during my time at Queens!
Sophomore,5,My experience thus far has been above and beyond my expectations. Faculty and staff have been eager to help me further my education along with helping me get involved in opportunities on and off campus! They truly care about your learning and ensuring it is the best of quality!
Niche User,5,I've heard great stories from alumni who loved it here and this is my dream college as well. The only thing that they complained about are the occasional professor teaching styles.
Freshman,5,"I have only been at Queens for a couple of weeks but it has been the best since I got here. I love the atmosphere and the people, and I never feel left out. The professors really care for their students and Queens offers so much help to us. I could not be more satisfied with Queens."
Junior,5,It is a beautiful campus. There are a lot of resources for students. They care about you succeeding.
Sophomore,5,"My first year went really great! Got to meet so many international studies. Queen's have the JBIP program to study abroad, and I am really excited. All the professors I had my first year were super awesome!  It's a small school in a big city! I come from a small town, so moving to Charlotte was a major change for me. I loved it!"
Alum,5,"The professors were always willing to work with students on an individual basis according to the students’ needs.  I never felt like a number.  I felt pushed to learn more about myself as well as about my chosen major, Music Therapy.  I cannot begin to put a dollar value on what I gained from Queens."
Sophomore,5,"The environment of Queens University of Charlotte is amazing, located next to the interesting Charlotte provides students a lot of entertainments. The school itself is constantly being renovate, and since the school really cares about nature protection, students are able to enjoy all the beautiful architecture and nature around campus. The education in the university is outstanding, it's widely recognized by many famous company, and the knowledge this university pass down is about to help students to have a great career."
Freshman,5,Great University Awesome Campus. Overall it was a great experience I played volleyball there they have a really close community. It is very close to downtown charlotte so it has its perks but it kinda sucks that there is a 2-3 year on campus housing rule but it just helps bring people together.
Niche User,5,"I will be starting as a freshman this Fall at Queens. From my first email to my admissions counselor, I really felt that this was the right school for me. When I  went to the Discover Queens event, everyone was so kind. The campus was so beautiful and made me feel at home. The staff was very nice and helpful. The overall atmosphere of the campus felt so welcoming. I can not wait to start with their nursing program this fall."
Sophomore,5,I love Queens! the academics are great and the professors care so much. The only things that I don't like about queens is there cafeteria is not good at all and the diversity needs work. Other then that Queens is a great college and I have had an amazing experience.
Junior,5,"Queens University of Charlotte is a small school with big school opportunity and resources. Essentially, here you get the best of both worlds, the attention of teachers and a genuine relationship with them as well as the chance to research, travel, and work. QUoC is a beautiful, idyllic campus that is only 3 miles away from Charlotte's City Center. This means you can have peace and quiet or the hustle and bustle of a city."
Junior,5,"Queens is a beautiful campus. It's a small, inviting community, with access to the greater Charlotte Metro area. The small class sizes really allow students to connect with classmates and faculty!"
Sophomore,5,"So far, I have loved my experience at Queens! It is perfect for those who like small, tight-knit communities. You see a familiar face everywhere you go. It's also great if you don't have a car because you can get anywhere on campus by walking in just five minutes. All the benefits of a city school in a small campus."
Junior,5,"I love the location of Queens, the size, and the beautiful campus. The people that I have meet already are absolutely amazing and genuinely care. The opportunities that are offered at Queens are amazing as well like the JBIP program. JBIP is a class that pays for students to travel different place of the world and learn more about things in there major and the culture. Job opportunities and internships are another great thing about attend Queens, they really prepare the students for the real world."
Freshman,5,"The sports programs are amazing, not to mention the calm, collected, and encouraging atmosphere of the campus. I'm excited to be continuing my education here."
Niche User,5,"On my college visit they were by far the most helpful and caring staff, they were genuine and alright with answering tons of questions about the college process"
Freshman,5,The thing I love most about Queens University of Charlotte is the scenery. The campus is well maintained at all times and the school spirit is impeccable as the students thrive on campus. The classes contain no more than 30 students therefore allows for a better student to professor relationship as well as easier access to communicate with them.
Freshman,5,"I like Queens University of Charlotte because it is close to my home. Queens University is a very small private college. There are a lot of opportunities. When you meet with your advisor or financial aid advisors everyone is friendly and they will continue to work with you, to get where you need to be. Classmates are also friendly and supportive as well. There are many close restaurants that are walking distant as well."
Junior,5,Queens University is a home away from home. I am a transfer Junior and my time here has been great . The class sizes are small and personal. The teachers a helpful and the students life is good on and off campus .
Sophomore,5,"Queens has been one of the best decisions of my life. All of my professors have been amazing teachers and role models. Also since the school is so small, the campus and people here have felt like home."
Freshman,5,If you are looking for a small private college then Queens University of Charlotte is the right place for you. Queens has such a beautiful campus that makes you feel at home. It also has amazing and very committed professor that take the time to get to know who you are as a student and your academic skills. As a Latina at this University the only  issue that I have is the low diversity. This University take student life very seriously to make the new incoming students feel comfortable to the transition. I highly recommend this University to anyone.
Niche User,5,I have not yet attended the college but will be next fall.  I have visited multiple times and I love it. I know and have met many people who go here and have only heard positive feedback from them.
College Senior,5,Queens professors are an excellent resources for academic assistance and guidance for carears and grad school options.
College Freshman,5,I loved it and felt like home. Very welcoming.
College Freshman,5,I love the college I am startong on. They not only care about our grades but about who we are as a person. They help you openly and make you feel welcomed. You are not just a number but a person whom the teacher get to know and have the pleasure to teach.
College Sophomore,5,Great place to find my major network and support.
College Sophomore,5,I would not want another college.
College Sophomore,5,My first year experience was awesome! I cant wait for this year
College Freshman,5,One of our graduation requirements is an internship; our school is very successful at finding and placing students in business setting where they will thrive. I feel fairly good about my chances at making a solid career.
College Freshman,5,"I really like how welcoming and accepting this college is. It it helping me transition from high school kid to a fully-functioning adult. The classes are engaging, and the professors are very kind and considerate. I really like it here."
College Freshman,5,"I really like Queens. It is a school where I am not a number, but a person. I can have meaningful interactions with my teachers and classmates. The Gen Ed program is new, but seems efficient and useful. The classes have been very investing and involving. I think I am really growing as a person, and as an academic."
College Freshman,5,"Health and Safety is a priority at Queens University. There are many services offered for students who need help in these areas, and campus police is always on high alert. If there is a threat on campus, alerts are sent via text message, phone call, and email to warn students and faculty."
College Freshman,5,"The academics at this school are rigorous and provide opportunities for growth. The courses are challenging, and are what you make of it. The professors are very accommodating, and want the best for all students. There are many courses offered, and class sizes are small which allows for meaningful interaction with the professors and peers."

There are many courses offered, and class sizes are small which allows for meaningful interaction with the professors and peers."
College Freshman,5,"Greek life is great at Queens. Many people who aren't on athletic teams join a sorority or fraternity, and the influence is a big part of campus life. Often times, sororities and fraternities will be fundraising for their philanthropy so their presence is known. There is no housing for sororities and fraternities, which makes it unique. There is a strict no hazing policy, and all chapters adhere to this rule."
College Freshman,5,"Queens University has been a great experience. There is so much that makes this school unique, everything from their study abroad programs, to internships, to special traditions. The academic rigor allows for exponential growth as a student and as an individual, and the sense of community makes all of the students feel at home. I would choose this school, every time. The experiences I've had there are unique to the school and the people there, and I am so blessed to be able to go to my dream school."
Recent Alumnus,5,Campus police are in the middle of the campus and easy to reach
Recent Alumnus,5,"The courses are interesting, the professors definitely encourage students to think outside of the box and to completely understand the concepts of the course. I feel that I am learning to actually retain the information to be able to apply it in different courses, not just to pass the exam at the end of the chapter or the end of the semester."
Recent Alumnus,5,The staff strongly encourage students to find internships even if they are not required for your degree. Staff also email students about internship opportunities around the city that are opening up for the semester or the summer.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Being a private university, it is easy to contact professors and get the help I need, whenever I need it."
College Freshman,5,"I'm already working with a client for Music Therapy! I'm getting more experience than I would've gotten at the other schools that I applied to, and I'm only a first semester freshman! I wouldn't trade it for anything."
College Sophomore,5,"I really love Queens campus. It is a wonderful, welcoming campus and everyone is so nice. The staff is very respectful and the food is great compared to the other campuses I looked at. Queens is small and the classes reflect that, but it allows the professors to get to know each student on a one-on-one basis which is really assuring because they care. I would not go to another school because Queens is where I belong."
College Senior,5,Plentiful options that are fun to eat at.
College Freshman,5,There is never a shortage of staff trying to set up students with job opportunities and internships. Internships are required so every student gets to be a part of the experience.
College Freshman,5,"I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the courses and professors here. All of the professors seem to truly enjoy what they are doing, they are invested in their area of study and share that with the students. Courses have not been too difficult, but haven't been extremely easy either (though it depends on the professor). 

The small school means small classes. On average, classes seem to be around 20-25 students, though a few can be as small as 10 or as large as 30. 

There isn't necessarily a huge variety of classes offered and some are  only offered during specific semesters."
College Freshman,5,"Being about 10 or 15 minutes away from everything, the off-campus dining options are huge. There is everything from grocery stores, fast food places, hole-in-the-wall dive bars, nice upscale restaurants and more. They are always easy to get to and there is always a place nearby within price range. Plus, a lot of places offer discounts to students."
College Freshman,5,The Health and Wellness center is on the edge of campus and it's always open. The nurses and receptionists are always happy to help. They really seem to care about the physical and mental of their students.
College Freshman,5,The diversity is great.  We all get along and don't let our backgrounds affect us
College Freshman,5,Love the salad bar and fruit.  Meat's are good and the rolls are yummy.  Ice cream bars are fantastic.  The dining hall is beautiful and clean and the menu's vary.
College Freshman,5,You can grab something good and healthy nearby or drive a few short miles and have fine dining.  It's all close by.
College Freshman,5,We all support our athletics.  It is great to be a Royal!
College Freshman,5,"Charlotte has it all!  Pro football, basketball and hockey.  Lots of great entertainment comes to Charlotte and there are several venue's.  Everyone is welcoming to students and helpful with directions.  Shopping (lol) second to none."
College Freshman,5,We are all the same.  We all get along and treat each other with respect.  Their housing is the same as non greeks.  We live in harmony
Junior,4,When I originally chose Queens I didn't plan on staying for very long but one semester at the school made me fall in love completely with the school. The professors and the students attending provide a sense of home like no other.
Senior,4,"My online experience was not horrible, but it was very time consuming. Since the nursing students were unable to attend clinical at the hospitals due to COVID-19, the professors seemed to tack on a lot of extra assignments in place of that and they just took way too much time away from my studying time. Other than that, Queens transitioned to online classes very smoothly and it wasn't too difficult to adjust to!"
Senior,4,"I love Queens and it's prime location, but the main issues with it are that it is a private school so it is very expensive and the communication between the staff and the students is not very good. Hopefully that will change in the future. Queens has an amazing nursing program, which I'm proudly apart of! I have one  year left and I am really excited to see where I end up after graduation."
Niche User,4,My experience has been good. I like their campus. I think they should change how their medical program works.
Sophomore,4,Very inclusive school.  Small school in quaint community in the heart of a growing city.  Administration is helpful when applying for financial aide and class sizes are great.
Junior,4,"While being enrolled at Queens University, I've been taught by teachers who have worked in their respective fields for years or who have had experience in other fields and bring all their knowledge into the classroom. I've attended classes where I was one of eight students in the room which allowed for the whole class to have deeper discussions with our professors."
Junior,4,"Go to a public university if you can. The school school has as many people as a high school. The dining halls are closed from 2-5 pm, the walls of the dorms are paper thin, you can’t have a car on campus as a freshman, and you are forced to live on campus for 3 years...name a school that’s like this..."
Freshman,4,"Queens is pretty great, not gonna lie. I have enjoyed all of my classes and the campus is really pretty/safe. I've only been here for 20 days so I don't know about the return on investment, so disregard that category. Besides not having a football team, the sports are good for a D2 school. The sororities here are philanthropic and don't have houses. The only things that are absolute cheeks are the food and the party scene. Overall, I like Queens a lot."
Alum,4,I really enjoyed my time at Queens. I really enjoyed the small class sizes and the professors were very helpful. It is very easy to get involved on campus.
Niche User,4,"I took a tour at Queens University of Charlotte with my program, Upward Bound and it was a great learning experience. The tour was very nice and well as they showed us what life is like for students at the university. If I get a chance to go to this college or university, I would love a chance to study a major in Athletic Training, play sports while i'm there, and go off to the National Basketball Association"
Freshman,4,Queens has an amazing athletic program and a very challenging work load academic wise. The only complaint I have is that they installed lights in the trees on campus which is bad for the ecosystem as a whole.
Junior,4,"I am a current junior at Queens and can't picture myself at any other school. The opportunities this university has helped me earn and prepared me for are unlike others you would receive at a state school or other private university. Travel abroad is included in tuition, internship requirements make our students more appealing to employers post graduation, and our professors have real world experience in fields that we are studying. Campus is beautiful and growing - with many renovations and the building of a new dorm we definitely have the nicest dorms of any other school and we're located five minutes from uptown Charlotte. 10/10 recommend."
Sophomore,4,It's a small campus and there are various resources to help students succeed. Everyone knows each other. The campus is beautiful. The classroom sizes are small so it is easier to and engage in classroom discussions
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Queens University of Charlotte and have had a pretty good year so far. I am in Alpha Delta Pi sorority and on the golf team. Being at the school, you can be very involved in many different things. The only downside to it being this small is that there is not a lot of parties and everyone knows everyone."
Senior,4,There's a great sense of community. Nice class size. Beautiful campus and great professors. Not to far from the city and can get to most places within 20 minutes
Sophomore,4,"I am a student-athlete at Queens and have had a great experience so far. My favorite part are the professors and academics at Queens. With a small campus feel, everyone there wants to see you and help you succeed in all that you do. The closeness of the campus makes it feel like a second home and that is what makes it great."
Senior,4,"They have been doing good about getting students to be active in the community, and look beyond their college careers."
Senior,4,"Queens is the perfect school for you if you love small, homey environments. Queens is a very small campus, it'll take you 5 minutes to walk to the farthest part on campus! The student body closely resembles that of the size of a high school (2,500-3,000) students. Queens is also a liberal arts school so here we focus a lot on the arts and you are required to take some arts courses because of this, but I loved it; it broadened my knowledge and forced me to take courses that I may not have taken otherwise. Because of the size of the school the ratio of professor to student is along the lines of 1:17, which is great because you are NOT known as just a number here, you are an individual that the Professor actually gets to know. It makes your experience better when you know that your Professor cares about you. If you enjoy truly being known on campus, small school/classes then Queens is the perfect fit for you!"
College Senior,4,Queens provides office hours for career advising and hosts networking events. They also post regular internship or career opportunities on the job board.
College Senior,4,All of the dorms on campus are fairly spacious compared to other campuses. Common areas are fairly clean although rarely used. Communal bathrooms can be the worst depending on the other residents on your floor.
College Senior,4,"The Queens community (although small) is close, suportive, and friendly. There's always something to do either on campus or in the city, but you have to make the effort to emerge from your cave and be social. The professors are by far the reason Queens is the best. They make themselves available not only as a resource to succeed academically, but to plan for grad school, life, and future career options."
College Freshman,4,Its seemes to be great.
College Sophomore,4,Beyond easy to get what I need when I am sick.
College Sophomore,4,Easy to communicate in provided atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,"Despite the tuition, the community around is supportive!"
College Sophomore,4,Student career prospects are great and very helpful
College Sophomore,4,Campus is really safe and there are people in housing to talk to if you're feeling unsafe
College Sophomore,4,My room was a good size and was very close to all of my classes
College Sophomore,4,love the sports life on campus
College Junior,4,I've enjoyed the majority of my courses
College Junior,4,career centers and services are made a priority
College Junior,4,i loved it last year
College Junior,4,im an athlete and i love it!
College Junior,4,The really get non-Greeks to be involved in whatever they have.
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on campus because the community we live in is respectable and safe.
College Junior,4,Professors care and make a lot of effort to help the students succeed.
College Junior,4,The internships that are required and the study abroad program are two things that will help me after college.
College Junior,4,Queens University is really great for helping you set up for your future career and life after college.
College Freshman,4,"I feel pretty safe on campus. Before we came to orientation, we were forced to do an online lesson about sexual assault, harassment, and stalking. It helped me feel safer about my campus, and I was encouraged to see that they took the issue so seriously."
College Freshman,4,"From what I have noticed, and truthfully, I haven't noticed that much, our sports teams are a rather important part of campus life. Games are well-attended, and there always seems to be posters and flyers out around campus to encourage us to come to more games and events."
College Freshman,4,"Housing is available for all students, and there are many dorms to choose from. Some are more spacious than others, and cleanliness varies depending on your dorm style."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Queens are a big part of campus, however not everyone is into it. Fan support and school spirit depend on the popularity of the sport, despite how good the teams are. The sports facilities are great for the athletes, as well as students who are just looking to exercise."
Recent Alumnus,4,There isn't discrimination against those who don't join or are not a part of it
Recent Alumnus,4,I don't know much about the athletics department
College Senior,4,"Although the school is small, we have great teachers."
College Junior,4,"I've enjoyed and learned a lot while tagging classes at my school so far. The staff isn't always the most helpful such as the financial aid counselors, but student advisors are great."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the college because it is small which makes transitioning between classes easy. In the classroom, the teachers try to engage with every students in their classroom. The classroom are usually small with a average of 10-15 people. The smallest class I had being had only six students which allow the teacher to spend more one on one time. To finish it all of the school is close to down town which is full of life on Thursday and Friday nights."
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of people do participate in Greek life, but it doesn't seperate those who are not a part of it, which I think is great. There isn't any housing for them, but the lodges are pretty nice in quality and since we are such a small school and campus it wouldn't make a lot of sense to have individual houses for each soroity/fraternity. Greek life positively affects the social atmosphere with the events they throw."
College Sophomore,4,"Some sports are more popular than others, which is to be expected, but sometimes it would be nice for the less popular sports to be supported more. The athletic facilities, the Levine Center, are great in my opinion. They have wonderful hours where they can be used and have a great variety of equipment and activities to do even if you aren't an athlete."
College Sophomore,4,"There are tons of places near campus to go and eat. Many are within walking distance, but being able to drive opens up the opportunity to so many more. There is a great balence between cheap, fast food restaurants and actual nice, sit down restaurants as well. Multiple places are open 24 hours which is great when you need a late night snack."
College Sophomore,4,"The strictness of the drug policy is well put into place. If a student is caught with drugs on campus they are not allowed to live on campus or go in the dorms the rest of the semester or year (I can't remember exactly). Alcohol citations are done somewhat often, but there is a lot that goes unseen behind closed doors."
College Sophomore,4,The pizza is always delicious.
College Sophomore,4,Lots of options just within walking distance.
College Sophomore,4,"It went smoothly, no problems."
College Freshman,4,plenty of places to eat. lots of variety there are student discounts offered at several places nearby
College Freshman,4,Its very cool living on campus. my dorm room and floor were great. everyone got along.  There was a mutual respect of each other.  it was pretty smooth housing process. I got the dorm I wanted.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are a huge part of the lives of many people here. Team performance is wonderful. Our shining teams seem to be the swimming and lacrosse teams, along with cross country, soccer, and basketball. Fan support isn't huge, but large enough for how small the school is. 

The Levine Center is relatively new and is wonderful. The gym equipment is up to date and easy to use. There is an Olympic sized swimming pool, indoor track, and basketball courts. 

The only downside with athletics is that there is no football team."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is the way to go. The dorms are all nice and very spacious, and they're all located within a few minutes of all the important buildings - academics, the gym, library, coffee shop, dining hall, and more. Each dorm has a set of free washers and dryers, most have a kitchen area and vending machines as well. Activities are regularly held in the dorms to keep socialization between residents going. 

The cost isn't particularly cheap, but it seems to be a good value for living on campus, and signing up for housing is extremely easy."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of malls, parks, places to go visit and hang out. There are a lot of restaurants and the campus is very close to the downtown area. There is always something to do in Charlotte, whether it be taking a walk to visiting museums or even going to a Panthers or Bobcats game! It's all here in the city and close to campus! It's a safe environment and everything is quite peaceful here."
College Freshman,4,Apply for scholarships early!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am trying so hard to get scholarships now to help with the financial burden
Alum,2,They have no comprehensive guidelines for how online learning should occur and most classes did not adjust their curriculum to make any learning worth it.
Alum,2,"Queens has a gorgeous campus just ten minutes from everything Charlotte has to offer. The safety offered by this location is excellent and far better than that of the University area, though that’s a great school. The reason for my low rating is due to the poor academics. If you’re considering attending Queens for nursing or business, then I highly recommend this university. However, if you want to do something in the arts, particularly IAD, consider SCAD, Pratt, or even Appalachian State. All of these programs are CIDA accredited where as the program at Queens is not. The design program at Queens is awful. There is a lack of respect for adult students, the assistant program coordinator is overbearing and controlling, there are no connections with those in the industry, there is a lack of affordable travel aboard opportunities for adult students, and lastly, there is no inspiration. You’ll save money and be better off going to a cheaper college that is already CIDA accredited."
Sophomore,2,"Feels like a bubble, few classes and food options, many students are not very friendly. Professors and small classes are great."
College Junior,2,For the women's sports there are hardly any support.
College Freshman,2,I need many scholarships to pay for college
College Sophomore,2,We don't have many options.
College Sophomore,2,There's no warnings and it seems like their always looking to get somebody in trouble.
College Freshman,2,"Depending where you live, it can be pretty awful. There was a rat in HBO."
College Freshman,2,If you don't have a car you're screwed.
College Freshman,2,Hard to get around town because of all the different buses and routes
College Freshman,2,"The cost to live on campus is super expensive, and their are hardly any actual benefits. The air conditioning/heat system sucks. There is mold in the dorms. The bathrooms are nasty."
College Junior,2,"On the main campus, there are many times when the internet and wifi will go down. This is extremely disruptive when studying or doing homework, and usually takes a couple hours to fix. "
College Junior,2,Dining options are not very valuable. Most of the students eat off campus or get the minimal dining plan.
College Junior,2,The greek life here is not very influential. They are not socially looked upon as cool.
College Freshman,2,Athletics SUCK. But our fitness center is top knotch
College Freshman,2,You've got to get a fake ID to go to most clubs. You don't hear about parties on campus since it is such a small campus
College Sophomore,2,"I'm vegetarian and the options at our dining hall are limited. They serve sauteed squash at almost every meal. I would love to have more choices. I can go to the Lion's Den to use my Lions Dollars, but the food is kind of greasy."
College Freshman,2,"The school is in the middle of an upscale area outside of Uptown, this serves as a barrier rather then an place to do stuff."
College Freshman,2,"Greek Life at Queens is pretty small. Don't believe the tour guides, they say its huge. Let me put this into prospective, there are five sororities, one of which only has seven members. This amounts to about 12% of the female population. In fraternities its only 2% of the population."
College Freshman,2,The young dining hall food is most of the time not that great. Most times I just eat fries and dessert. There is a variety but even that is not cooked great. Most people usually end up eating at the coffee house and the Lion's Den because lets face it the food is better there than in the dining hall.
Alum,1,"Food is terrible, administration is extremely rude and terrifyingly bureaucratic... have denied their students basic assistance through corona virus and have ignored several groups of students requiring assistance."
Alum,1,The online classes were for those only required by Queens. Meaning they were classes that can not be transferred elsewhere. Obviously this is a money grab.
Senior,1,"Queens University of Charlotte is truly a waste of your time and money. Believe me when I say this. As a recognized senior and spending all four years at this horribly ran the institution, which I do regret, I will not be the only one to say Queens should be shut down. 

If you like to have any type of fun, this is not the place to go. There has not been a party and everyone goes home on the weekends. The food is horrific and the professors are some of the worst individuals I have ever come across, including anyone in the administration. 

I truly wasted 4 years here and PROMISE you will feel the same. If you were to ask a majority of the students that attend Queens, they will proudly tell you this is the worst decision they could have possibly made."
Freshman,1,"I attended this place for a year and honestly don’t even know where to begin with telling you how bad this place is. The food is terrible. This app gives the school a B- for party scene, buts it’s a solid D- unless your on a sports team! There’s not many clubs that I liked and that’s only because they offer pretty much nothing. Also the dorm that I lived in had heated Floors for some reason and I have just recently found out that it was a pipe and now
the entire first floor is melted and destroyed...Lol like come on. There’s cockroaches everywhere. Campus cops are always walking through dorms. If this college is on your list I’d either take it off or just throw your computer out because this school is the definition of a disease.

Teachers on the most part were helpful and nice, but the school wasn’t the right fit for me."
Freshman,1,"If you don't have a car you are screwed. If you do have a car, there is most likely no place to park it. The campus is surrounded by a wealthy neighborhood, which makes for a uncomfortable non traditional college experience. If you enjoy being surrounded by superficial white people this is a good fit. Academic advisors ignore you and take weeks to respond to your emails. Campus police treats you like a criminal. Resources do not feel like resources. The campus turns into a waste land on the weekends. The cafe ""tries"" to be creative. I applaud them for trying but the food is not healthy by any means. The people who work in the coffee house are predominantly rude. Advice for future students. Do not judge a school by its campus. They may have all the funding in the world but Its irrelevant. Once you look past the upscale amenities, I don't see the value. If you are in it for the diploma and not the education, its a good fit. Personally I will choose people over places any day."
Alum,1,"Academics are a joke.  This school is for parents who want their dumb kid to have the college experience.  Couldn't believe I worked on a research paper for a class, spent a lot of time typing it and checking sources, and was proud to get an A then found out a girl in the class wrote hers the night before hand written on notebook paper and also got an A. She didn't include footnotes or a sources page  (required on the assignment sheet the professor gave us).  Then I found out nearly everyone got an A except for the ones who didn't bother to turn one in. I went to the prof to complain she said ""just be glad you got an A.""  I was so frustrated and tried to get out of there but they make it very hard to transfer. to another school.  Deciding to go there was the biggest and most expensive mistake of my life."
Niche User,1,"The staff and professors are absolutely rude. I only went for a visit and went to the restroom in the cafeteria and an employee cut in front of me and said ""employees come first here, learn your place freshmeat."" The professor i met told us that he didn't really care if we pass or fail, he's not teaching for us."
College Sophomore,1,The food isn't good most times. Nothing is open on the weekends and the campus basically shuts down on the weekend.
College Junior,1,"Terrible school do not go here, it was the biggest mistake of my life.  I just had a teacher tell me that she has no intention of reading a paper that she had me rewrite.  I went to meet with her one on one, after arranging this meeting a week in advance, to make sure the assignment was completed effectively, because it counts toward my final paper and she laughed at me and said ""oh honey you know I had no intention of reading this"".  The wi-fi is terrible, i've even had class cancelled because of this.  They nickel and dime all of the students so they can build new buildings.  If queens was going to improve wi-fi then I would donate but they don't have their priorities straight.  The wi-fi wouldn't be as much of an issue if older students were able to move off campus.  But if you are not a resident of NC you have to live on campus until junior year, which is (pardon my language) BULLSHIT."
College Freshman,1,Campus police will treat you like a criminal if you are out past 12.
College Freshman,1,"CHARLOTTE SUCKS. If you are in any way liberal, get out while you can."
College Freshman,1,"The film program here is basically non existent, and it is very frustrating. The equipment is straight out of 1982 and falling apart. Its a shit show."
College Freshman,1,"The process is the worst, it made me not even wont to pursue a college education."
College Freshman,1,"There's limited space every semester, and more than 1,000 people try to apply, and only about 50 are qualified."
College Freshman,1,"I think we have athletics, but as an average student, I don't really notice them."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no nightlife, but most of my fellow students don't want one.
This is a conservative place, but not in a political way, but in the way that nobody wants to do anything creative or interesting or take any risk.  I am not exactly a wild party animal, but I am going out of my mind.  Everybody who wants to do anything goes home for the weekend or to their boyfriend's school.  There are no places in Charlotte you would want to hang out.  A bunch of girls were going to get together this weekend and make hot chocolate and watch Downton Abbey.  That will be a big party by Queens standards. "
College Sophomore,1,"They will not throw you out unless you kill somebody.

However, you will be penalized and lose your parking and get stuck in a room that is like a prison cell if you break minor rules.  If get caught with a beer or you make noise that sounds like you are having a party, you may wind up arrested.

You won't see people doing much of anything outside because the campus cops will stop just about anything that looks like fun that might possibly cause ""liability.""  Sitting out and reading a book or eating a sandwich is allowed."
College Freshman,1,"I am speaking with respect to the freshmen housing. The dorm I was put into has been plagued with mold, vermin, and mice. Living on campus is a but of a racket as now you must live here until senior status. The room I was initially assigned had mold all over it due to a leaking heater. I was temporarily moved while this issue was supposed to be resolved. That was October 22nd. I still have not been able to return to my old room. (It is almost February) Considering there are much more affordable off campus options I am very dissatisfied with the housing. Additionally, the heaters in the rooms are antiquated and do not work well, I find that it is freezing all the time. I feel that the freshmen housing options are poor."
College Freshman,1,"There is very little to do at school, People ask what there is to do on the weekend, I am either told to go to a club or go watch netflix."
College Freshman,1,"Parking here is terrible, plus campus police seem to find ways to give tickets when you are flowing all of the rules."

Freshman,5,I didn't take any classes online but I hope to take some summer classes online. The school does provide online class year around.
Graduate Student,5,The best experience! The most caring staff. I am so thankful for the opportunity and support while obtaining my masters degree. The best HIM program.

Freshman,5,"The College of Saint Scholastica was a fantastic college for my first year as a student. Although it’s expensive and changes are needed, the students and faculty are pretty amazing. Everyone is very kind and not to judge. The professors are always available and always willing to help and explain. The food is not ideal, but it’s pretty good for the resources they have. The campus scene is beautiful and incredibly inclusive. The people are always willing to help and be kind. I’ve never been somewhere where people are so nice to you, even if they don’t know you. The faculty has countless ways to make sure each student succeeds."
Freshman,5,Going to Scholastica has been a really good experience for me thus far. The people here are smart and motivated but still like to have a good time which has been a good balance.
Freshman,5,Everybody there wants you to succeed and works so hard to fix problems you might run into in your education. They also do an amazing at creating an inclusive environment for everybody despite being a Catholic college.
Senior,5,The professors and staff really get to know you on a personal basis and strive to help you reach your goal of graduating with a career not just a degree.
Freshman,5,"Small College, with a huge focus on the wellness and academics of the students.  Professors are amazing, they always are checking in to see how the students are doing and if they need help. St. Scholastica offers a wide range of student support services, putting the student first always. As far as athletics St. Scholastica offers many team based sports, and many inter murals. Over all this is a place you want to go for community, hospitality, respect, stewardship, and a love of learning."
Junior,5,The classes are very focused and the teachers are always willing to answer any questions you may have! I positive experience!
Junior,5,"The College of Saint Scholastica is a charming campus filled with professors, eager to make a difference in students lives. They not only curate an energetic learning environment, but the instructors work hard to develop lasting relationships with the students in their communities. I personally had a professor check in on me over the summer to see how things were going, and offer support during a stressful time in my life. I would definitely recommend this college."
Junior,5,"School, campus, professors and the local area are awesome! The food program however- AWFUL. For anyone with dairy and/or MSG   sensitivities the food program will either leave you in the bathroom for hours on end or starving!"
Freshman,5,"It’s an amazing, welcoming community. Has a great, high quality staff delivering a high quality education."
Freshman,5,"The College of Saint Scholastica does an amazing job of individualizing your experience. Each person you meet with greets you with a warm and welcoming smile and is more than willing to help you. They offer so many different services, activities, clubs, classes, majors, and individual experiences."
Freshman,5,I honestly love everything about The College of St. Scholastica. I love the community feel and the small class sizes. The small class sizes allow me to understand the material a lot better. I have also made some very close friends here at the College. I would not change anything... Well maybe the weather!
Junior,5,"The thing that I like the most about St. Scholastica is how welcoming the environment feels. People are always super nice and welcoming, and it’s a good change from the high school I attended. I see people everyday doing things to help others out even if it’s as simple as holding the door for another person."
Junior,5,I am loving the experience so far.  The staff and the professors are willing to help with anything you may need.  I can not wait to walk at graduation at a castle setting.
Junior,5,"The community here is so welcoming and inclusive. The small class sizes allow you to actively engage with your peers and faculty. There are so many resources available to studentnincluding career counseling and peer tutoring. It is easy to become invested in this beautiful community and find the support and tools you need to become an empowered, educated individual."
Senior,5,"I really like the small atmosphere, how the professors are always there to help you learn and how we follow our Benediction values"
Junior,5,CSS is an excellent school with excellent professors. The small atmosphere is extremely inviting. The only thing that is not so great is the food program. It is expensive and not very tasty.
Junior,5,"In CSS I always felt welcome because students and faculty are understanding, If I did not understand something, there is always help or someone to assist in making things understandable."
College Sophomore,5,"Professors are super helpful, classes are super engaging, workload is manageable, and the library is a great place to study."
College Sophomore,5,My courses were very stimulating. I loved the topics of my courses and how many professors assign papers or projects instead of tests. Professors were very helpful and tried to get students engaged. Most classes were very small.
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe on campus. I would often walk to the computer lab at night and feel perfectly safe. Campus security is always around at night both in buildings and driving around. RA's also make rounds at night. I did not hear of a sexual assault the entire year.
College Sophomore,5,I love St. Scholastica. The faculty there is extremely approachable and helpful. They want to see you do your best and reach your goals.
College Junior,5,There are phones throughout campus that can be used to call security if at any point you feel unsafe.
College Freshman,5,The courses I feel really challenge you. The professors are great for the most part and are super helpful!
College Freshman,5,"So far my experience at my school has been great! Everyone is so welcoming and helpful, it really made me feel more comfortable transitioning from high school to college."
College Junior,5,I enjoy the comorting atmosphere here.

College Freshman,5,I love this college the community is great
College Freshman,5,"I fell in love with this school sophomore year of high school and my dreams came true when I decided to attend. I think the school and people are awesome. The classes I think are very difficult, but if you focus in class and do the homework and study you should be fine. I have also met so many amazing people!"
College Junior,5,There the best! Football team like never loses
College Junior,5,The make sure we get a degree and a job out of our schooling
College Freshman,5,I feel right at home on campus. Everyone is so nice and helpful.
College Junior,5,"My school is the best!! I wouldn't choose any other school, the professors and staff are there for the students when ever they need it."
College Freshman,5,Duluth has a variety of great restaurants.
College Freshman,5,Duluth is a major tourist spot in MN so many off campus dining spots
College Freshman,5,Usually you can find discounts wherever and there is a lot of variety.
College Freshman,5,All professors are helpful with getting all needed material to students and helping in anyway possible.
College Freshman,5,Administration if great.  They put all students first and care about safety.
College Freshman,5,Staff was great and assisted with all the questions I had.  Excellent assistance
College Freshman,5,All sport members are highly involved with school and local area spirit.
College Junior,5,"I love the CIS department, and am learning new things about the field with every class. I would choose this program again. I am pursuing a hybrid software and web degree, that will allow me to explore career options in the field. I am concerned about having to move away from Duluth."
College Junior,5,"Students of all ages come together in small class sizes - this allows for a personal learning environment. Professors are well-versed in their fields, and strive to keep things fresh and exciting."
College Junior,5,"There are beautiful hideaway gardens, a nice updated gym, and a decent library."
College Junior,5,I love that the professors care about helping you succeed. Saints get hired!
College Freshman,5,It is a great major. It is perfect for where I want to go in my career. I plan to work in foreign affairs and international relations and such. I am worried if I need to go on to graduate school to really get where I want to go.
College Freshman,5,"It was so easy, all I had to do was go into One Stop and ask for help. I have been given scholarship help, billing help, anything you can think of!"
College Freshman,5,Good area to be in.
College Freshman,5,There are a lot of opportunities here.
College Freshman,5,We're ranked the #1 Social Work program in the area.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about the College of Saint Scholastica is the very caring professors. They have always been very understanding of my situation and they are always willing to help in any way that they can. St. Scholastica has more very helpful resources than you'd believe. Overall, the school made a very good first impression on me and that impression has indeed lasted."
Freshman,4,The College of Saint Scholastica is such a warm and inviting place. The professors genuinely care about the well being and success of their students. It is a lovely place.
Sophomore,4,"The College of St. Scholastica has been a good experience overall for me, I feel like the professors here want what is best for you and support  you from day 1."
Freshman,4,"The professors at this college are fantastic! They honestly care about your education, but above that they care about your well being and how you are going to leave the school. They want their alumni to leave campus a better person and create an impact on the world wherever they go."
Freshman,4,The professors care about their students. The small community offers close connections. Certain majors make for somewhat of a vigorous course load.
Freshman,4,"Wonderful school, I simply wish they offered more of a variety of courses or made it easier for students to take those courses elsewhere."
Freshman,4,"Honestly, academic-wise, I love this school. The professors are caring and understanding. They actually want you to succeed and want to watch you succeed. They make class very interesting for the most part too. As for the students, extremely cliquey. If you came to college to only make acquaintances, then this is the right college. A lot of the students here either came from the same area or already came with friends, and they aren't very willing to make new ones. So if you come from anywhere farther than Cloquet, MN, then you might want to keep your options open."
Alum,4,"I like that I was welcomed with warm open arms from my resident advisor, academic advisor, and teachers. I had multiple on campus options for living arrangements, and an opportunity to work on campus for money toward my tuition. I didn’t enjoy the price all that much."
Senior,4,"The teachers bring a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience to the table. The school does its best to find ways to make college more affordable for students. One detractor has been the extended campus experience. It is fairly clear that the extended campus program is fairly new and is constantly being improved and worked on, however these constant changes lead to frustration for the students and ultimately result in more negative experiences with the school."
Freshman,4,It has a beautiful capmpus and the professors are well educated. The location offers many opportunities for students. It’s also a very manageable size of students. Overall it’s a very pretty and good education college.
Senior,4,There is a generally friendly and open atmosphere throughout campus. There are plenty of opportunities to meet people and get involved if you look for them! Professors are approachable and want to see their students succeed!
Sophomore,4,"I liked all of the different things I could get involved in such as Intervarsity, knit and crochet club, campus ministry, Circle K, and Loaves and Fishes through Vita. There were a lot of activities to do there and places to hang out with friends such as playing games and watching movies or going on nature walks. The location is very relaxing as it is a very scenic place being surrounded by lots of trees with a view of Lake Superior. The nursing program is very good as are the classes and professors. I loved some of the courses such as choir, orchestra, anatomy and physiology, microbiology, and others. The people who attend here and work here are generally very inclusive to others."
Senior,4,"I liked the small community feel that Scholastica offered, but at times it can feel too small and cliquey. Overall I had a good experience as the general staff and student body was very welcoming and friendly."
Freshman,4,"The College of St Scholastica believes in Benedictine values that the faculty, staff, and students have to live by and it creates a great community that is not hard to adjust to. I love the way classes are conducted: the Professor to Student ratio is good. There are a lot of resources on campus like Writing Centre, Supplemental instructions, Campus Ministry, WellU and many more that actually makes CSS a good home away from home. The resources are not only helpful in terms of learning but also physically, socially and mentally. You can never go wrong at the College of St Scholastica."
Senior,4,"I really enjoy the effort that staff and faculty put forth to help students succeed at pursuing an education.  They provide many resources for students to utilize that help prepare students for not only college, but life afterwords as well."
Senior,4,"St. Scholastica is a wonderful, welcoming community of people, but it tends to feel like a high school because of its small size. I really wish they had the funds to expand the campus, such as having our own football field and improving the quality of buildings, which are quite old. Despite the number of clubs on campus, many sport-related activities can't be hosted due to lack of space on campus. I could go on, and although it's nice in some ways, there are more areas that need to be improved, for safety and a better, full college experience."
Junior,4,"CSS has a a beautiful campus right by Lake Superior, it also has a lot of technology resources for student use, especially for healthcare majors. Because Scholastica is a smaller, private university, it can get clique-y at times although this has seemed to improve since I entered my actual program."
Junior,4,The college of St. Scholastica is a very welcoming campus. It’s professors really care about you as a student and want to see you succeed. You are not a just a number here with smaller class sizes. This is one of the best colleges in Minnesota.
Junior,4,"I really enjoyed my professors in the Exercise Physiology program, my classes are challenging, engaging, and relevant to what I'll need to know in my future job. Sometimes the party culture on campus gets to be a little too much, but I just stay away from that side of things."
Sophomore,4,I really like the small school atmosphere.  CSS is a very welcoming community with friendly students and faculty.  The professors are dedicated to providing quality education.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I am enjoying The College of St. Scholastica. Although the campus is smaller than I prefer, the small class sizes make it easier to learn and gives me more opportunities to talk to the professors. In addition, many of the people I have met are welcoming, respectful, and kind. The professors also share these characteristics as well as prepare their students effectively for upcoming tests, quizzes, projects, and finals. In addition, the professors can also be very entertaining and funny making classes more enjoyable. One thing I do not like about Scholastica are the many flights of stairs you have to go up every day as well as the long class hours you have to sit through."
Freshman,4,"My experience as a freshman at the College of Saint Scholastica has been outstanding. I would highly recommend this school to students who are looking for a lot of small class sizes, a great community of students, and wonderful staff who are there to help you with literally anything you need. The RA's in the Freshman dorms are very nice and end up to be your close friends, your professors will always recognize you and say hi to you in the hallway, and our dean of students is fantastic. She emphasizes our five main ideals very strongly which are: Stewardship, Community, Hospitality, Respect, and Love of Learning. These are shown everywhere around campus and it makes you feel very at home. I would say that the only downfall that I see about living on campus is that the food in the dining hall is not all that great, but otherwise our other food places on campus are not bad. The atmosphere at Scholastica is one everyone should experience."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the college, especially the beauty of it and being in duluth. However, besides the smaller class sizes, I don't think the tuition price is worth it."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the school is a great place to be and the knowledge you gain here is amazing!  The Professors are great, they push their students to strive academically. One thing I would say is negative about the school, is the parking. Parking on campus is horrible! You have to pay $150 per semester to park on campus, and when you do find a spot, you have to walk a half mile to class. I just got a hundred dollar ticket a week ago for parking in the wrong spot. I wish they would try to improve the parking situation."
Freshman,4,"The professors at CSS are very friendly and ready to give a helping hand. You just have to seek for them. The environment is very inclusive, yet very welcoming. Five of the core values that CSS has are Community, Hospitality, Stewardship, Love of Learning and Respect. These core values make CSS a friendly environment and academically fun. The drive that it gives students here is very uplifting since all the staffs are very helpful and supportive to their students."
Senior,4,"This college has great professors, as well as a good system that supports you, and helps you to find what you need (Resources, Financial Aid, etc.)... I'm in my Senior year in the Online Accelerated Program and I'm excited to join the business world using all the things I learned from CSS's Management professionals.... One down side: the expense; tuition isn't cheap."
Freshman,4,I'm going to be a freshman this year at CSS. But I can tell that the students and staff seems nice and welcoming. It is located in a very beautiful city! I like CSS's purposes and intentions. The school actually wants you to accomplish real world problems alone indepently.
Sophomore,4,"Overall the College of Saint Scholastica is a very welcoming, strong, and supportive community. Every weekend there is something to do on campus that doesn't involve drinking, there's many clubs to join, excursions to go on, and things to see in the beautiful lake-side city of Duluth. The small classrooms and encouraging professors makes college feel more comfortable and less nerve-racking. The staff and students really make an effort to making your college experience a great one. So far I've been outrageously politically active, recieved school newspapers with my articles published, learned that I liked Rugby more than Cheerleading, and made some lifelong friends. The two year On-campus living requirement makes transitioning from home, to dorms, to apartement living, much much easier. My first year had ups and downs but I don't regret my choice for a second."
Freshman,4,"Saint Scholastica is a great campus  set in beautiful Duluth, Minnesota. It is a small school with a little over 4,00 students. It is predominately white and there have been issues with inclusivity, but many minority students and myself are doing many things to try to change that. We hope to bring more diversity and inclusiveness to the campus."
Freshman,4,The College of St. Scholastica is a small community where anyone can feel comfortable. The staff is very helpful to your needs whether it be academic or financial. Professors know your name and are always helpful to your needs.
Freshman,4,"So far my college experience has been good. The students and staff are very friendly and the classes are challenging. There is also a lot of events on campus, but it can get rather quiet sometimes."
Sophomore,4,"I love The College of St. Scholastica because it is truly a close knit community. The small school feel and the people you meet made my experience here so far, amazing. Every where you go you run into people who are friendly and going to make your experience better. There are always things going on on campus and always things for you to get involved in. The only thing I would hope to change is improving the living spaces a little bit more. Other than that I think this school is the perfect place for me and several others."
College Junior,4,I've had a good experience so far
College Junior,4,"Teachers were very helpful, and workload was perfect!"
College Sophomore,4,"Northern Minnesota is not very diverse, but the campus is very accepting of minorities and peoples' differences."
College Sophomore,4,"There are parties and drinking, but none of them get out of hand and campus security is always around."
College Sophomore,4,"I am a little young yet to be looking at potential careers/internships, but I do see a lot of advertisements for career fairs and potential internships."
College Senior,4,"In general, I feel very safe on campus.  Campus security is available 24/7.  Phones are placed throughout campus to call security if needed.  CSS is a close community and goes out of its way to make sure students feel safe on campus."
College Senior,4,I love the small class sizes and the teachers get to know you on a personal basis.  There is so much to do on- and off-campus for my small school.  I would definitely choose this place again.
College Junior,4,"Instructors are very approachable and helpful. Sometimes I wish that there were more classes offered related to my field. Class sizes are small, which makes the class environment nice."
College Junior,4,"I love my school because it is smaller, which makes it more personal. It is east to get to know people, make friends, and get the help you need. The campus is not very big, which makes it easy to navigate. The only downside would be the price."
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had much of a problem with any crime, nor have I heard of anyone have problems with this (on campus)."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not really sure what the value is. I know one of my doctors graduated from here, and there are a couple of alumni that have gone to graduate school at MIT, or the Mayo."
College Sophomore,4,"Our athletics programs are the best in our conference (outside of that is debatable). Our gym and indoor track is better than almost every other school's that I've seen (including some D2 schools). Students can get involved, but mostly for men's football and basketball and not much else. Our football team, men's and women's track and field, baseball, cross country, softball, soccer, and debatably men's basketball (2015-16 season) are the top in the conference."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is beautiful, and the lab facilities are excellent. There are a few great professors, but some of them are a bit much for what level of class they are teaching. This school is great for sciences, but okay with other types of education. I don't thing this school is very accommodating for commuters."
College Freshman,4,"The facilities at The College of Saint Scholastica are kept up to date and has a clean, comfortable atmosphere for individuals to work out, participate in Varsity sports and club teams. They also have a large span of activities such as work out classes that are highly attended."
College Freshman,4,"I am attending The College of Saint Scholastica to pursue receiving a degree as a registered nurse. Being that The College of Saint Scholastica is a college known for their nursing program, they have many opportunities and classes for students to succeed. I am grateful to be a part of their program and have had an awesome experience as a student there."
College Freshman,4,"We are very white, but the diverse students fit in well, and they have great clubs"
College Freshman,4,"Good housing, Somers is a little old but it's no big deal"
College Freshman,4,Everything I've ever hoped for
College Freshman,4,"Many friends, teachers are great, facility and food could improve, fitness is capabale"
College Senior,4,Do not regret attending this college.
College Senior,4,Pretty secure in job market.
College Senior,4,I've never felt unsafe on campus.
College Senior,4,Being close to classes and all friends is great.
College Senior,4,Students are friendly and helpful in preparing and studying for exams.
College Senior,4,"It's a smaller school so sports are not that big of a deal, however school spirit is definitely seen throughout homecoming. Students and teachers are both very helpful in studying and preparing."
College Freshman,4,First year students are required to do online sexual assault awareness training before they begin their first semester of college. There are many support services on campus that are targeted to help those who have suffered from sexually assult.
College Freshman,4,The athletics on campus are a huge part of campus life. Our football and hockey teams are quite good. There is lots of student participation in athletics whether it is varsity or interminable sports.
College Freshman,4,Overall great courses and instructors
Senior,2,"One of the most depressing schools ever. Super expensive, they will kick you out if you can't pay and some professors lack empathy. No diversity at all and is cliquey, if you have an option go to UMD down the street."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many parties on campus. This is probably seen as a good thing by adults, but weekends get pretty boring for students."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many parties on campus. This is probably seen as a good thing by adults, but weekends get pretty boring for students. Most parties happen in the apartments."
College Freshman,2,Not much happens in Duluth
College Freshman,2,"Party's happen, but there is one good one a week and if you choose the wrong one it probably sucks"
College Freshman,2,"It is very poor, outside of the sciences it is a joke, don't come here for anything but nursing or PT"
College Freshman,2,"Sports here suck, and the athletes don't understand that they are not special, anyone can make our teams"
College Sophomore,2,"The community here is not very accepting if you don't fit into the ""norm."" When I toured the science program was great. However now that a few teachers have retired and been replaced by new ones its not as good anymore. One of the teachers is not willing to help students. Another has a poorly structured class and many people leave feeling confused and unsure of what we were supposed to learn during that class."
College Junior,2,"Housing in Duluth is expensive. Students tend to go to Campus Park and Bluestone, which is just about as expensive as an on-campus apartment."
College Junior,2,"i dont drink, do drugs, smoke. i notice it everywhere. i feel awkward and isolated on the weekends."
College Junior,2,It's not a nice neighborhood
College Junior,2,"There are a few lots on campus that we have to cross a bridge to get through, or walk a far way to get back to our apartment.  If I am alone I tend to get frightened, and do not want to use the campus security escort service.  I am a 6ft tall girl, and I feel like they would look at me and assume I could handle my own, and then would refuse to escort me."
College Senior,2,Public transportation in Duluth is not the greatest. The buses aren't always reliable and they come every half hour or more. Taxis are expensive so I wouldn't recommend that but there is a little shopping plaza that is with walking distance.
College Freshman,2,"Do not come to Duluth for the weather, if you are looking for a warm place to sit out by the lake, keep looking. Lake Superior is always cold and the weather up here in general is cold."
College Freshman,2,They have scholarships but if your not a 4. student and get top scores on your ACT you have to really research to find them.
College Sophomore,2,The wifi is horrible. Depending on the building you are in it comes in okay. The printing labs are normally full and run out of toner a bit.
College Sophomore,2,"the bus system is ok, but it cannot take you all the places I would've liked to go. It also takes quite a while to get anywhere using the bus."
College Freshman,2,"Not Enough and Too Far Away – There are a lot of off campus students and on campus students who need their own vehicles for transportation but there is great competition for parking spaces, many of which are far from the classroom buildings. Freshmen are encouraged to not bring vehicles to campus, since they are required to live on campus and the college gives students free bus passes."
College Junior,2,"Local Areas – high priced, few parking options in many areas, lots available not all on bus routes, buses not reliable"
College Senior,2,We do not have enough parking for commuter students and to get a decent spot you need to be on campus long before your class.  The tickets are also way too high in price.  The need for a car is high for those who commute to campus.  The only thing good about our parking situation is the low cost of our yearly parking permits.
Graduate Student,1,"If interested in occupational therapy, I BEG YOU to consider a different program. Saint Scolastica’s MSOT program is extremely disorganized, lacks diversity and ignores students’ concerns. To a program that is supposed to train health care professionals, I found the lack of empathy and concern for humankind by not only most of the students but most of the professors as well to be both heartbreaking and disturbing."
College Junior,1,We don't have a Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"Very poor. Very expensive, and not very good variety. Not much good food wither. also, they close really early, so if you are at school late, you have to eat out of vending machines."
College Freshman,1,"I didn't receive any of the prep information that would have made my transition less stressful.  Still, I'm in need of funding and am at my wits end."
College Student,1,"Been here a year, learned to day that a incoming freshman in my major that tested well on ACT (>30) yet didn't even finish high school above a 3.0 will get a $15K+ scholarship each year for the next 4 years yet others like me who finish in the top 5% of thier classes with 3.8 and ACTs of 28 apparently will never get a chance at these. Also apparently anyone with 30+ ACT gets auto-entry into the grad program as long they have at least 2.0 GPA while we may not get in even though our GPAs are 3.6+.

Do your research before selecting this school."
College Freshman,1,"It's a downright nightmare. Since we are on a hill to begin with it can be tricky in the winter months, which is basically the entire school year. Plus if you live on campus you cant park in any of the lots next to the school or even in Somers parking lot and the available parking lots aren't very close."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is terrible most times of the day. I have to drive through multiple parking lots and usually find nothing. Then I have to drive all the way to the back side of campus to walk 15 minutes back to the building my class is in. Parking cost is great, but its frustrating to not be able to find a spot if I come later in the day. More parking lots and spots should be made. Make a parking ramp for goodness sake! Or don't allow freshman to bring vehicles unless they have a real reason for one (medical emergencies, etc)"
College Junior,1,"Couldn't Receive Enough – My parents make a good income so I couldn't get much financial aid and was not eligible for any scholarships through the school so it gets hard to pay for my classes. Also, when I did apply for financial aid it was a long process and it didn't go very smoothly."
College Sophomore,1,"They ticket like crazy, parking lots if you live on campus are nearly always full and far far away. Not to mention confusing parking rules during the winter for snow removal."
College Sophomore,1,"Food = NOT GOOD – The on campus food is absolutely horrible. Off Campus is the usual McDonalds, Burger King etc...no Chipotle"

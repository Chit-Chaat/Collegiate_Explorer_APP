Freshman,5,Teachers are very helpful and informative. Easy schedule to follow. requires determination and perseverance
Junior,5,Austin Peay State University has been very helpful and facilitating my decision to return to school after 32 years to study my favorite subject - the earth.  All of my counselors and professors have done everything they could do to help me and others with course work and degree planning.
Junior,5,"When the COVID-19 virus hit our country, all of my classroom classes became online classes.  Each of my instructors researched and implemented successful course work so we could all finish out the semester.  Now they have spent their summer redesigning their classes so they can be done efficiently online.  I appreciate their hard work and dedication to our education."
Junior,5,"I have taken all of my English courses online as well as a History course I have almost completed. I feel like the courses went very well, and I loved taking the online. As a Science major I spend most of my time in lecture or lab, so I need the ability to take some pre-req's online, I'm thankful I had good professors for all the courses I've taken."
Sophomore,5,"Online classes are amazing! I prefer doing online, especially with having anxiety. All professors are easy to reach out to and get back to students quickly."
Sophomore,5,I have taken several classes online at Austin Peay.  While the workload feels as though it is more the professors are always more than happy to be of assistance and the work each week is a lot of working at your own pace.
Sophomore,5,I have enjoyed my experience at Austin Peay so far.  The professors are very helpful and there are various services available to students in order to assure success.
Senior,5,"I take some classes online and hybrid classes that are pretty well organized. However, the interface is a little choppy and poor at times."
Sophomore,5,Austin Peay is great!! Lots of sports and a small campus so you get to know lots of people! People are very friendly and want to make you feel welcomed. There are many clubs and activities that you can be a part of!
Senior,5,"Austin Peay is a fairly small school, but the amount of school spirit and educational opportunities make up for it. This school has prepared me so well for my future. The professors ensure you understand the material and they do everything in their power to help you succeed. The STEM department is amazing and I have learned so much. Austin Peay is known for having a great nursing and education program. My experience at Austin Peay was amazing and I will always cherish my time there."
Freshman,5,I love the campus. It is very easy to learn your way around and I feel safe walking from class to class or even to get food. I feel like they should add more restaurants and have more activities for everyone to get involved in. A lot of the professors are nice and helpful when it comes to obtaining your education.
Junior,5,Austin Peay State University is a very excellent school. Every professor I have had here has been very helpful and understanding.
Freshman,5,"Hello, my name is Jada Laubree Kennedy and I am currently living in Clarksville Tennessee and also attend Austin Peay State University. I'm a freshman as of now but going into my sophomore this fall of 2020. So far my experience with APSU has been great through the first and 2nd semesters, of course, we all have challenges that we must face especially when we are not used to a certain environment and honestly that was myself at first. Throughout the semester I began to see changes within my academic performance, social skills, and confidence level increase rapidly.  Two of my favorite professors were: Sabrina Marsh and Kimberly Morrow."
Freshman,5,"They have been extremely kind, patient, and helpful during my application process. I have known the orchestra director since my sophomore year in high school; not only has she helped with processes regarding the school itself, she has also lent her time to helping me with advice for struggles with playing my instrument. They are, as far as I've seen, extremely accepting of individuals in the LGBTQ+ community, and their dorm and restroom policies, for example, display that. For the state of Tennessee especially, I was very pleasantly surprised."
Freshman,5,Austin Peay is a good school with great opportunities. I feel like Austin Peay is another home to me and it brings me great pleasure to be honing the school and learning about new things and new people.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Austin Peay State University is outstanding.  The teachers are amazing, they are easy to work with, and the library has every resource a college student would need."
Senior,5,"I have attended two other colleges in a different state, and Austin Peay is by far the best. It's the most perfect campus for a biology major. The campus itself is an arboretum, and one of the professors was part of the team that discovered photosystem II. A student recently discovered a new species of crayfish. There are many programs for adult and nontraditional learners. They also have a great support system for veterans and students with disabilities. I'll be graduating in two months, and I'm so happy I finished my degree here."
Freshman,5,"The people who gave the tour were very energetic and made the tour fun. They did a good job with knowing all the information about the campus, which made my decision to go easy."
Junior,5,Austin peay is a campus who appears to be a a stepping stone for any and every one who wants to brighten up their future. I'm excited to attend the last couple of years completing my degree.
Junior,5,"Austin Peay is in a really cute part of town. I work right up the street at the local newspaper, so I am able to ride my bike to school when the weather permits. When I do have to drive, I am comforted by the fact that the parking lots are well lit and have an emergency phone. The college has a lot of history, and the campus is beautifully kept. I transferred here this semester and am really loving my experience."
Sophomore,5,"It is the best college out there. there is so much diversity and sports for everyone there. Its not that big of a party scene, it is also a dry campus."
Junior,5,"I love Austin Peay! The community atmosphere is great! There is plenty of clubs and activities on campus. The one thing I would change is to offer diverse food options. As more and more people choose to live a healthier lifestyle, such as vegan or vegetarian, Austin Peay needs to be aware and offer food options to all."
Freshman,5,"Amazing school, small but roomy campus with an amazing university center and places to study. Great facilities with amazing history even better professors."
Niche User,5,My experience was great. The counselor replied to all my questions and i cabt wait to continue my schooling here.
Niche User,5,"During my  freshman year of high school,I ran track.I was on the varsity girls long distance team for Northwest High school.

Sophomore,5,My first year at Austin Peay State University was a great experience! I enjoyed engaging with new people and getting involved on campus.
Sophomore,5,I have learned so much at this school! I have been out of school for a few years when I joined the Army and I was truly afraid of what it would take for me to get back into the rhythm of everything. I have loved my classes so much that it doesn't even feel like work. My professors are qualified and they make learning fun.
Freshman,5,My experience with Austin Peay was a peaceful experience. The campus is huge and the students are very vibrant and nice. They have a great tour staff to help us explore the campus. They have great community groups that are all around campus and they have many different organizations for freshmen. They are very welcoming towards guests and new students. Austin Peay is a diverse community that has many different community oppurtunities in order to meet new people.
Freshman,5,"My experience as a freshman has given me so many opportunities to grow and learn skills that will continue to reward me in future aspects of my education along with meeting new people of many walks of life. It has given me confidence in my studies and taught me how there is 24 hours in a day that you can use at any moment to learn something new, gain more knowledge no matter the time of day. It helps me pursue my future goals to one day make a difference in this world and stay positive no matter any circumstances."
Senior,5,"I like APSU, because it makes you feel like you're part of a family. The faculty and students all want you to succeed! This college truly allows you to meet life-long friends and bring out the best of yourself."
Freshman,5,Sigma chi is the best fraternity of all time. Sigma chi is the best fraternity of all time. Sigma chi is the best fraternity of all time. Sigma chi is the best fraternity of all time.

Junior,5,I absolutely love attending Austin Peay! Being apart of the GOMB is my favorite thing! Not to mention the amazing staff and beautiful campus!
Niche User,5,I have taken dual enrollment classes for the past two years during high school. I have had such a great time completing these classes. My professors have been extremely helpful and supportive considering I was balancing my high school requirements with college classes.
Freshman,5,Austin Peay is a great university to attend with lots of nice and helpful people around. Love the community.
Niche User,5,"I am enrolled in APSU.I have been to AP Day and was very very impressed. I like how close everything is, yet the opportunities you have both on and off campus. I like their blue light system which helps with 24 hour security and assistance. They also have essay correctors that guarantee a letter grade better after. The only thing I would change is there cost of some stuff compared to the size of the campus. Other than that, I am impressed with what is in place for me in the next 4 years."
Freshman,5,"Austin Peay delivers a sense of security because you know you are getting a great education at a reputable institution as it provides friendly professors, diverse student body, as well as an excellent environment for furthering your education."
Sophomore,5,I love Austin Peay! Everyone is so friendly and helpful! I had a choice to go there and some other couple colleges and as soon as I stepped on campus for the tour I knew it was the one!
Freshman,5,"Austin Peay State University offers an excellent Leadership and Organizational Administration degree in Professional Studies. The academic environment is easily accessible, diverse, and versatile which provides excellent opportunities for modern academia. I would like to see (and it is my intention to start) a Native American Student Association."
Junior,5,I love this school. I blend easily with my peers and I get all the help I need when I need it. The staff and professors are amazing and easy to get along with !
Niche User,5,"My experience with APSU has been great, however, I feel like we need more free speech zones. As young college students entering the real world, we need to be heard and our opinions express, respectfully."
Niche User,5,Maybe a better parkinglot. Its very hard to get to class on time even if I leave early. It'd be nice to have more parking towards the classes.
Graduate Student,5,This beautiful campus is the perfect size for those who want a small college experience with the liveliness of a larger university. The faculty are amazing and actually care about students. It makes everything worthwhile.
Freshman,5,"my experience here was very good , the professors are very hands-on and more than willing to help you succeed."
Sophomore,5,Awesome people. Faculty is very friendly and understanding and helps so much on our academic success.
Freshman,5,the Austin Peay campus is astounding along with the atmosphere. the college professors are amazing and will not let you down!
Junior,5,"Great school, the most affordable university in the state, and professors take their profession and getting students where they need to be academically."
Senior,5,Austin peay has been a great school. I enjoy that it is a place for traditional and non traditional students alike. The nursing program has been beneficial in furthering my career. I am thankful for the opportunity to accelerate my schooling by 7 months with taking summers.
Sophomore,5,I like just about everything at Austin Peay because the professors are understanding and want us as students to succeed. The food is great there and the student life are amazing to be around.
Alum,5,"I came in my Junior year as a transfer student. I absolutely loved my experience and wished I would have originally chosen this school for my entire 4 years. I learned a lot about myself, joined a sorority and even found a job in my career field due to my internship that my major required."
Alum,5,"I think Austin Peay is a good school if you are looking for a smaller campus with less crowded classrooms. If you find a program you love, professors will have lots of opportunities for you to grow your passion and research. While Austin Peay has a lot to offer in academics, there is not a lot going on around campus. If you are looking for a school with a huge social scene, Austin Peay may not be the best fit."
Sophomore,5,"Austin Peay is a great school full of diversity and fun. The campus is a beautiful place; not to big and not too small. The proffesors are great, and very helpful. I woyld recommend anyone to com to Austin Peay."
Freshman,5,I love the fact that Austin Peay State University gives you an opportunity to experience multiple events on campus. These events makes it easier to get to know one another. What should change at Austin Peay State University is the Expansion. We should have buildings set u-p for different events. We should have a building strictly for studying and a building for games and events for after class.
Niche User,5,"Austin Peay state University is an amazing college to go to, the professors here are wonderful and the games are so much fun. i would recommend Austin Peay to any person i know, it is truly a great college"
Freshman,5,"It was a very diverse campus I met so many different people.  Besides the people that attended , they had so many different organizations that ranged it became a factor of which one should I choose. It had really nice amenities like the Foy center which was a fitness center , it included a rock wall and an indoor track and out outdoor pool which include friendly staff. They always had smiling faces which made me want to be around campus. There were also many programs through the Foy such as fitness classes and rock climbing days. My favorite thing was the ministry which provided a hardy lunch every Wednesday for only 3 dollars."
Sophomore,5,I love how well maintenance the campus is. They take pride in the the way the campus looks. Pretty scenery and animals running around.
Niche User,5,"My name is Jerome Cook, I'm a junior at Humboldt High School, And what I like about Austin Peay is that it has good programs and majors, and I heard that if you're struggling with your work, you can always ask your professor for help. And what I would change is to stay in school, get a job, focus on my career and  take any steps of where my career head me to."
Junior,4,"This is my first year at APSU, I am a transfer student, and everyone made it so easy to become a student here!"
Sophomore,4,Austin Peay is overall a nice 4-year college you definitely get your amounts of money worth as the staff was very exceptional about your studies and the campus was very beautiful.
Junior,4,"I transferred to Austin Peay this previous semester and it has been lovely. Due to the pandemic, I was not able to experience the campus as much as I wanted. My professors and classmates made this transition very easy by helping me find all of my classes. The campus environment is very safe and friendly and I cannot wait to experience more of Austin Peay and what he has to offer."
Junior,4,Online learning was a bit challenging in the beginning but most of my professors took it easy on us because they understood the pressure of being forced online. Professor still answered emails and asked us if we needed any help so this was great.
Sophomore,4,The college held events on certain dates which would count as stress relievers during the fall and spring semester if you were to live in the dorm areas events were held there as well. There were multiple opportunities to make new friends and in some classes the atmosphere was stress free.
Sophomore,4,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, we transferred to online classes after our spring break. The online courses of the classes were easy as long as you kept up to date with upcoming tests, assignments, and quizzes."
Sophomore,4,"Due to COVID-19, everyone had to finish class online. Some of my professors were very helpful and would have zoom meetings with the class so students could understand the material. Other teachers added a lot more work that was not necessary."
Junior,4,"I love the town and atomsphere surrounding APSU. I have had a few problems with the science teachers and physics department, but other than that I have no complaints surrounding my time at Austin Peay."
Sophomore,4,This is a great school other than financial aid not getting back to students as quickly as they should.
Senior,4,"It has a good atmosphere and staff, overall it is a good university. However, there are some internal issues and organization that can be a hassle sometimes."
Freshman,4,"I went into college with a mindset that I was not going to enjoy it because I did not enjoy high school, but I love Austin Peay. I feel as if the staff and professors as a whole really care about the student population and that means a lot to me. I've had so many professors care about me as an individual in such a short time of being a student here. Our professors want to see us succeed. I have such a good support system here and I know the people around me care about my success. It helps me to be determined and keep my drive, something I am very appreciative of and take very seriously. 
    Really my only complaint would be how expensive food/supplies is on campus. Our tuition is very cheap compared to most colleges so I can't be too angry with the high prices, but I do however feel as if they should take it easier on us since it is widely known that most college students are broke. But again, I do understand that they have to make their money as well."
Junior,4,"Overall my experience at Austin Peay has been very good. I love the education of the HHP program. There's always something to do on campus as far as engagement, and the athletics are nice. This school is also welcoming of all students of different backgrounds."
Junior,4,"Overall I’ve had a great experience. The campus isn’t too large that you get lost, it’s pretty simple to maneuver. Three professors are also capable, friendly and easy to talk to. The campus is safe and there’s lots of eateries to choose from. The university is in a military town which in my opinion makes everyone a little more appreciative  and accepting of each other. The university has great WiFi connection which we all can appreciate; they also do well in the dispersing of funds and making them available just when you need it most. Overall Austin Peay is a great option."
Junior,4,"I just transferred to Austin Peay last semester and I’m loving it so far! The campus is diverse, the faculty and staff are friendly and wanting to help, and there are many organizations on campus that you can get involved in!"
Freshman,4,I loved the close proximity of the lecture halls to the dorms. I feel that there could be more dining options though.
Freshman,4,"What I liked best about Austin Peay this Semester was the Athletic Departments. If I had my choice to change one thing, it would be the food prices, all the food there is EXPENSIVE!!!"
Freshman,4,"I have only been studying at APSU for one semester, but I can say that it is a great school. My major is in music theory and one of the reasons that I like this school so much is because of how it emphasizes the importance of the arts."
Freshman,4,"Austin Peay is a very laid back school. I have the freedom to choose whether or not I can participate in school related activites. Additionally, APSU has a variety of extra curricular acitvites such as clubs or student organizations. I currently wish to join the pre-professional health club in order to get a head start on my pre-medical career. Furthermore, I am an avid piano player, and APSU has a building full of pianos free for all students to use. I really enjoy going to school here, and I look forward to spending my next 4 years here."
Niche User,4,"I enjoy the size and the environment of APSU. The campus is a nice size, making it big enough for all the students while being an easy walk between classes. The only issue I have with the school is that a good handful of the professors do not speak solid English and sometimes their accent is too difficult to understand. This truly makes the learning process difficult."
Junior,4,"They have been mostly accommodating with my transition into their university, but there are some improvements that can be made with regards to Green to Gold students. Certain course restrictions make it difficult to work out with the unique nature of a Green to Gold student."
Sophomore,4,my last semester I got a really good adviser but the one before told me to take a class for humanities then the next semester told me that it didn't qualify so i had to take a different class.
Junior,4,I love Austin Peay State University because it feels like a home environment. They always have something to do either on or off campus. It is very easy to meet new friends. Professors as well will make you feel comfortable and help you achieve your goals in college.The food on campus is delicious and there is even a Starbucks and Einstein bros bagels !
Freshman,4,"There is so much help and guidance to be offered at Austin Peay that it is very easy to get accustomed to college life easily. Your academic aids offer help for the right classes for you, and help with classes you may be struggling in. There are events almost every day on campus that create a fun and exciting environment, and they often give out free food, clothes, and other merchandise to students. Austin Peay is the perfect place to have a small community environment, while still getting the right college experience for you."
Freshman,4,"Offers classes both on campus, and online. Classes can also be taken on the local military base, for active duty and civilian government workers, alike. The classes on base are 8-week sessions, which is very nice!"
Junior,4,I like Austin Peay State for its cozy and welcoming atmosphere. There is a wide variety of majors to pick and activities to do.
Senior,4,Good school. I enjoy being at this school. Class sizes are very small. I have 3 more prerequisites to complete with not money.
Junior,4,"Psychology major at APSU. I love the faculty/staff in my department! It's also easy to get involved on campus, plus it still feels a bit like a private school for a public school pricetag."
Freshman,4,Good environment and nice staff making for learning experience. The campus offers quite a few nice amenities such as a chickfil-a right next to main hall. The library is pretty decent and even has a store to  buy needs and necessities right there on site so you dont have to travel across town to Walmart or other stores.
Senior,4,I like it. It’s a pretty good place over all. Teacher are nice and the financial aid does not loose your documents.
Sophomore,4,I'm a sophmore at Austin Peay and so hard I've had a amazing time. It's a small yet big campus and there's always something going on and to get involved in.
Freshman,4,"Austin Peay does a phenomenal job in making sure incoming students are included in the campus, making them feel like they belong. They also care a lot about the student's well being. They make sure that the students never go unfed with free food and we will always have clothes."
Sophomore,4,I like how small the campus is. The professors and classes are great. I am enjoying the material taught and how the professors are flexible with office hours. I have been through many appointments for office hours and it helps to better understand the material if you are unsure of anything.
Junior,4,"There are always events happening and something fun to participate in. The university has done well with expanding the art department recently, but I also wish there was a more expansive range of majors to choose from."
Freshman,4,It's a nice campus and seems to be very safe. The class schedulers were all so helpful with getting my schedule together and making sure I had a good understanding of everything. Austin Peay offers a variety of classes and schedules that is more convenient for the new freshman on campus to get adjusted.
Senior,4,"Austin Peay is a great school. I started fresh out of high school, then took a long break. I am now a senior and highly anticipating graduation. Austin Peay has made so many updates to the campus, they have really provided a great atmosphere for  students. I think the school has something to offer for everyone including non traditional students. With their Ft. Campbell campus, they have made obtaining a degree possible for those that have jobs and are not able to attend traditional main campus classes."
Freshman,4,I have yet to start there but so far they have been very active with helping me with the process of getting in
Freshman,4,This is supposed to be a small school but this year we had an attendance of 11000 students. We are growing more and more every year and have some of the best students and professors in the state! I am in the College of STEM as a geology major and I love the school.
Niche User,4,Austin Peay was a wonderful school to visit. It has a wonderful campus and many great things to offer to their students. I will be happy to attend this fall in 2019.
Sophomore,4,"Kind of feels like high school 2.0. Doesnt feel like a crazy party school. While it doesnt have the resources of a larger school, the tuition is lower and it is still a decent education experience. All the teachers I have had so far care about student success."
Freshman,4,My experience at Austin Peay has been amazing. The diversity on campus gives me a feel for real life.
Niche User,4,"Austin Peay State University is like a home away from home. People are friendly and helpful. There are emergency phones located all over campus for quick and easy use for students. You can easily walk from one side of campus to the other in about 4 minutes. The campus itself is very clean and well kept. Unlike most colleges, the professors at APSU try and get to know you instead of making you feel like just another number or just some more cash in their checks."
Graduate Student,4,Austin Peay teaches and treats students amazingly. The rather inexpensive tuition cost is also a huge bonus. Campus atmosphere is fantastic. The one thing I do dislike is there enrollment processes along with their financial workings quite often get messed up. You have to stay on them to get stuff done
Sophomore,4,I like going to Austin Peay because the whole campus is very local and all in one area. They have very nice cats that walk around campus and are very friendly. The one thing that I would change is the amount of parking near classes. Or adding a bus that takes students from the parking lots to the buildings around campus.
Junior,4,"For the most part, I did enjoy Austin Peay. It is a very beautiful campus and is always clean. It is a smaller school in a smaller town so if your career choice would require a lot of outside networking it may or may not be difficult for you to do so. They do host a few career fairs during the semester so that is still good. The food is okay but still better than most schools in the state. The dorms are pretty kept up. It is a bit pricey for a student with not much in scholarships, so it would be a good idea to apply for as many of them as you can if you aren’t getting much outside help. There’s usually no more than maybe 30 students to a class (unless a bigger lecture such as biology) which is great, it’s easier for your professors to get to know and recognize you when you need help which is a very big deal, to me at least. There are also many clubs and organizations to be involved in on the campus, not as many as other schools, but still quite a few and very diverse."
Sophomore,4,"I loved how the campus was very focused on safety. The campus was a bit larger than I was use to, however fairly easy to navigate. The food options on campus are amazing and very nice for both commuter and those students who live on campus. Very welcoming and helpful toward transfer students and military families. I wish they would offer a bit more financial aid for those incoming and military families and students."
Niche User,4,I personally love how Austin Peay reaches out to their students and students they want at their school.
Alum,4,"I attended APSU 3 times. It is a wonderfully, diverse campus. I am glad I got to experience it. There is also free tutoring on campus."
Freshman,4,I appreciated the diversity and inclusion of all students no matter what grade they are in. I do wish there were more group studies and tutoring for students who may be struggling in a certain class. The scenery of Austin Peay is terrific. It is well kept daily and seems to never fall from outstanding. Most of the professors are able and willing to fit around each students situation. This allows every students to be comfortable with their schooling.  I highly recommend Austin Peay to anyone looking for a school to make them comfortable and happy.
Senior,4,I love it APSU! I transferred from a small private Christian college and although campus isnt the most impressive we have more tha  we need as students!! There is endless academic help my only real criticism would be how terrible it is to be advised.... I havent encountered a good academic advisor yet but they are all teachers. Despite the fact that their academic advising could be better the faculty and staff are friendly and helpful in times of need (especially in the psychology department)
Niche User,4,Well the University and teachers are great but the campus does flood a lot. Which can make it difficult to want to go to class.
Niche User,4,"I liked Austin Peay because of the simplicity and size of the campus. Although it is not ridiculously small, this campus is also not overwhelmingly big. If you are looking for a friendly and ""feel at home"" college I would highly recommend APSU!"
Niche User,4,"I currently am a high school and have taken multiple classes at Austin Peay State University through the middle college. My professors are challenging, yet very helpful. I am very pleased with my experience on this campus. Everyone is very welcoming and there are plenty of opportunities to become involved on campus."
Niche User,4,"visiting Austin Peay State University was an overall great experience. Going into the school i loved the dorms, the size of it, and that it wasn't too far from home. Another reason i like the school so much is because i know a couple of people attending the school. There is not much that needs to be changed, the school is overall a good school the only thing that needed to be changed is not being around a city."
Niche User,4,Austin Peay is a great school. I visited this summer and I loved it. The campus is peaceful and the students are very sweet. The dorms are nice too.
Niche User,4,"What I liked the most about the institution was that it truly made me feel at home. Not only was I a few hours away from my family, but I was also receiving an amazing education without breaking my bank account."
Senior,4,The classes at APSU aren’t too big so you get to have a more personal connection with the professors. The professors also are readily available for extra time if you need it one on one with them.
Junior,4,I like how small the campus is! Nothing is too far and yet there are so many students and clubs and organizations that give it a big campus feel!
Sophomore,4,"I am going into my sophomore year of college and I am proud of my decision to attend Austin Peay State University. I have had a wonderful experience with my advisor, who gives wonderful advice. The dorm I stayed in was good, the cafeteria had amazing food, and I felt very safe on campus. I would recommend Austin Peay to anyone who asked about it."
Sophomore,4,"I love the smaller class sizes and the smaller campus in general. I like that I can walk to all of my classes. However, I feel like there should be more parking because it is very hard for commuter students to find a parking spot unless they get there early in the day."
Sophomore,4,Austin Peay provides so many opportunities to all of the students that attend. There are amazing people that work there that are willing to help anyone at anytime. The professors are all amazing. Austin Peay makes me feel at home. The Gov's are my family.
Alum,2,"I loved Austin Peay when I attended the College of Business, but I hated it when I went back for Nursing.  The professors in the Biology department are awful.  They talk about students behind their back, and nothing is done about it.  I felt unsafe and targeted.  I emailed the President and heard nothing back.  If you do attend Austin Peay, go to the College of Business.  Don’t bother doing anything inside the science building."
Freshman,2,I had a great first semester but did not enjoy second semester at all. After attending APSU for one year I learned college for four years was not for me.
Senior,2,"Wasn't super impressed by all of the staff members. Every advisor I have had here has steered me in the wrong direction; guaranteeing things such as programs and then I don't get in them. Very little staff members are actually nice and helpful. But majority not so much. Campus is pretty. Parking is hell for commuters such as myself. The people are so-so. I picked this university only because it was an hour away from my home, not too far away."
College Freshman,2,"Freshman overflow is in hotels, kinda sucks for them bc they don't get to live on campus. I live in the honors dorm and had to meet certain criteria to live there, but my roommate didn't."
College Sophomore,2,I don't care too much for it.
College Junior,2,The university is best known for its nursing program and that is where a large portion of the funding goes. I am enrolled in the Political Science program. The current department head seems to actually encourage plagiarism and herd thinking. Few of the current instructors will actually push you to your full potential. Most of the instructors in the department are more focused on being your friend rather than an instructor.
College Sophomore,2,"Extremely poorly funded school. Too many problems to list outright, but here are some important points:

- The caf food is decent but be prepared for long lines as cooks scramble to supply food for the students. Sometimes you'll be asked to take a seat for ten minutes or more so they can prepare food. You can't serve yourself, and they give you least amount possible. Some days are just a waste of a meal plan.

- If you think parking is bad at UTK, UTC or TTU, you haven't been to Peay. It's a running gag here. Police give tickets wantonly; a HUGE commuter parking lot has been closed for a whole year now for ""construction"" when in fact no construction seems present.

- A lot of the students are rude, loud, and even violent. There have been multiple fights in the cafeteria and commons area just in the past three weeks. It feels like a high school.

- Area surrounding is notorious for shootings, just like it up on google! Very unsafe area, literally less than a quarter mile from campus. A lot of apartment-students have been robbed at gun point."
College Freshman,2,"Just google us, we suck."
College Sophomore,2,"Clarksville is a pretty boring town. It's ridiculous, really. There is nothing to do unless you want to go out to eat, hit up the bar, or go grocery shopping. There is no nightlife in this cesspool."
College Sophomore,2,There is the Grove and then University Landing. I don't think there are any other off campus housing that's for students.  The cost of living off campus is probably much cheaper than it would be to live on campus.
College Junior,2,"After living on campus for a year, I got very tired of the food choices at Austin Peay. The variety is very limited, and not much is open late or on weekends. The cafeteria is okay but the food is somewhat plain. I would love more options for food, especially more ethnic food. A Chinese place, a salad bar, and maybe even an ice-cream store would be amazing. I think they need to extend the hours of the restaurants because if you're out late studying the only place open is subway and that closes at midnight."
College Junior,2,"Applying for financial aid is very frustrating in my eyes. It is all based on what my parents make, but just because my parents may make decent money that doesn't mean they are helping me pay for college. A lot of scholarships and financial aid is completely based on financial status but as a college student, I am taking out loans and worrying the whole semester about keeping my scholarships because I am not getting any extra help because my application is considered on what my parents income is."
College Freshman,2,"I was planning on moving off campus, but the rent every month is extremely toooooo high per person. One apartment for four people is $500 per month/person. I just have to stay on campus."
College Freshman,2,At one time the athletics were much better. The baseball team does well and students give them a lot of attention. The football and basketball programs are terrible and receive little attention.
College Freshman,2,I couldn't get financial aid so I had to get a loan.
College Freshman,2,THere is not enough parking spaces.  You will get ticketed if you park in the wrong lot.
College Freshman,2,It is cold and raining.
College Student,2,"Financial aide stresses me out so much, but for tips I would have to say to..

Stay on focused on your loans

take out only what you need

SAVE SAVE SAVE"
College Freshman,2,"It's like a smaller version of UT, everyone gets drunk, and if you aren't in to those kind of parties you are basically screwed."
College Freshman,2,Students pretty much do they want!
College Freshman,2,They don't try to help you get more financial aid at all. It's all on you and it is very confusing.
College Freshman,2,I'm struggling to find info.
College Freshman,2,I do not like the food around here.
College Freshman,2,"I haven't personally seen people using drugs or alcohol on campus, but I have heard of it being done. I have also smelled marijuana in one of the residence halls before."
College Senior,2,"They're stuck up, entitled, and annoying. Most of them are only in school to continue their high school popularity as long as possible."
College Senior,2,"When I lived in Hand Village, guys would park outside my window every night and a group of people would gather around with the music bumping and everyone screaming and dancing. It was ridiculous and nobody did anything to stop it."
College Senior,2,They're college students. Enough said.
College Senior,2,"The library facility is good, but it's too loud."
College Freshman,2,Parking is the only thing that campus really lacks.
College Freshman,2,Everyone is a stuck up Greek. It's hard to find someone who isn't a hypocrite Christian that actually has a moral code.
College Sophomore,2,"If you come to campus around 9:30, good luck finding somewhere that you don't have to walk. If you have a morning class and get to campus before 8 am then you have your pick of places, but they fill very quickly after that. The expansion to campus is great, but the park lots keep becoming new buildings and nothing is replacing those parking lots."
College Freshman,2,"This past season, our football team was not very successful. The only game I attended, people were barely cheering for the team and just acting like it was a big social event. Several people were barely even paying attention to the game. It is kind of sad that we can't even support and encourage our football team. "
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is a problem. Tickets are $25, but it is worth it to get to class on time. "
Recent Alumnus,2,There are not enough parking spots on campus. You end up having to parks pretty far from your classes.
College Junior,2,"There are days that are incredibly hot and humid and some that are pretty chilly.  Then, there are occasional tornado warnings and lots of thunderstorms, sometimes flooding.  Usually it's pretty nice out and warm, but I don't like the unpredictability."
College Sophomore,2,"Clarskville, TN is a small town with a heavy military influence as it is home Fort Campbell. You usually find your average run of fast food restaurants, family oriented chains such as Applebees and Ruby Tuesdays, and of course your random array of Chinese buffet style restaurants. While eating off campus is fairly cheap, and most restaurants close to campus offer discounts to students, I can not say I have found a local restaurant that has really impressed me yet."
College Junior,2,"Parking is a nightmare at the beginning of every semester but gets easier as the time passes. It is wise to come in at least thirty minutes before class starts to be hopeful that someone else has left early. There are many parking lots available for students, but the sheer number of those with cars does not make up for the amount of lots available. Students often have to park off campus in order to make it to class on time."
College Freshman,2,"The area around campus is scenic and has a lot of dining and shopping options. The are around campus is unsafe, but the campus is very safe."
College Senior,2,They have stuff going on. I'm not impressed but others like it.
College Freshman,2,"Parking at APSU is honestly pretty terrible right now. Living on campus is a lot easier, as there are colored areas designated for each dorm. Commuting is awful at the moment. If you want to get to class on time while commuting, you are going to have to learn to walk. The large parking lots that offer space are all on the outskirts of campus. Most people complain a lot more than necessary, as it is not that hard to walk a few minutes, but it can be a little inconvenient if you schedule your classes too close together. The school has plans to expand some of the parking lots and add new parking, so the problem should not be as bad in the upcoming year."
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of things to do such as the park down by the river and the mall downtown. Other than that though everyone leaves on the weekends so it's pretty dead.
College Freshman,2,I'm enrolled at Austin Peay State University for Biology/Pre-med. I enjoy APSU as a college for academics and student life. But Biology/Pre-med is a hard major because there is a lot of information to learn. All of my professors are extremely qualified and work in the fields they teach. I've had a few professors who are really tough but they do it to help you for medical school. All professors are extremely understanding when it comes to life interfering with school. They've worked with me throughout the course and did one on one instructions. There are plenty of opportunity for internships with research studies and the local hospital and doctor offices. They are also great for recommendations for grad school if you really take the time to build a relationship with them.
College Junior,2,It is too cold and the weather is not consistent with just one weather type.
College Sophomore,2,Clarksville is a very average city with very average dining options. We don't have anything that really stands out as being unique.
College Sophomore,2,They weather changes every day. But this is TN so it's not always consitant.
College Freshman,2,"Parking Is Always A Struggle, It Will Literally Take You 30 - 45 Minutes To Find A Parking Spot"
College Freshman,2,It Gets EXTREMELY Cold And Ice Covers The Ground But Classes Rarely Get Cancelled.
College Freshman,2,"I received only the Hope Scholarship (given out by the state to everyone for a 21+ACT). Apparently my family makes just enough money to receive nothing else, even though I'm struggling."
College Freshman,2,"Mainly only bars. Parties are held frequently but only if you know people. The Coup is a great place to go for music and arts if you're into that. Other than that, there's not much if you're under 21."
College Senior,2,"This can be a blast if you find the right friends, and if not Nashville is just close enough to drive and have  a great time without being so close that is effects your studies. The outdoor trails and night life are growing along with the city."
College Freshman,2,"Parking on campus is really good before 8, around lunch time, and usually after 4. Any other time you could be driving around for a good 45 min. trying to find any parking."
College Junior,2,"Unless you start classes at 6:45 am, don't waste your time looking for a spot anywhere else but behind the FOY or across the street by the Gilroy!"
College Junior,2,"It's a really nice college, but food is expensive on campus and there is only fast food around. There are not many choices, and the nightlife is non-existent for some one like myself. There is no good health food stores (like Trader Joes or Whole Foods), but the actual scenery is nice- green grass, brick buildings, and down the road a riverfront. I would like to see more grocery stores, higher quality restaurants and more student friendly coffee shops."
College Junior,2,"The parking is terrible if you show up after about 10:30 or before 2. The amount or spaces available is usually reduced to 0. If you find yourself having to find a spot during these times, be aware you might just have to follow someone to their parking spot. Most of us will be pretty cool about it and tell you exactly were."
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive any financial aid other than offers for student loans. I thought I would at least receive some kind of assistance since I am a single mother and my expected family contribution was zero.
College Sophomore,2,"Do Not Commute – The parking is horrible. If you have to come on campus any later than 8am, good luck on finding one."
College Senior,2,"Leave It to the Greeks – There are a few houses on campus. The pikes got kicked off for drugging girls and their house got torn down. There is a place called greek village which is kinda like dorms, with out the RA's. Everyone is really nice to each other and greek life on campus is really about helping the world and community service. Of course when the sun goes down its a huge party!"
College Senior,2,"Fans Rock, Team Sucks – Out of any college the biggest sport they play is football. Unfortunately for our school, the football team sucks. they have only won a handful of times yet people still seem to come out for every game, throw a great tailgate party, and enjoy the game anyways."
College Senior,2,"What? We Have a Team? There is an athletic program at APSU? What? I went to a basketball game ONCE. The gym is tiny, overcrowded."
College Sophomore,2,"During Noon. The times of 10am & 3pm the campus parking sucks. It's manageable on some days, but very few. So come early, or you'll get a ticket for parking in the wrong space."
College Freshman,1,Not many good housing selections near the campus. Madison street is notorious for crime and poverty.
College Freshman,1,Austin peay is always messing up my financial aid . Every semester when it's time to register for classes I can't because its something they put in wrong or some button they didn't push. It's very nerve rackjng.
College Sophomore,1,"The school doesn't offer many scholarships to begin with (compared to some other schools), and the handful that are offered only apply to specific groups of people (alumni, military, etc)."
College Sophomore,1,"It's hardly noticeable. Being a dry campus, all the parties are somewhere else. Makes campus life pretty boring."
College Sophomore,1,We have the worst financial aid group EVER. They cost me THOUSANDS of unnecessary out of pocket costs.
College Sophomore,1,"Our teams stink, and we waste a lot of money on them. The new stadium is a huge waste for a losing team."
College Freshman,1,There's nearly nothing to do for underage students.
College Senior,1,I have a 3.9 GPA and no aid. I work too hard for that
College Freshman,1,Not enough parking spots for all of the commuters and they are always doing construction in the middle of spring and fall sessions that closes even more parking possibilities 
College Freshman,1,There is hardly parking and most students are commuters. The trolley is inconvenient and the bus is filled with people from the projects 
College Freshman,1,"Hardly anyone attends some of my courses. Also, the officers are never around to enforce the speed limit or the no smoking on campus. It's the worst having to walk behind someone smoking on a ""smoke-free"" campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,There is nothing to do nightlife wise you have to drive 45 min to nashville.
College Junior,1,Parking is a nightmare! It is absolutely horrible!
College Freshman,1,I believe students should be staying on Campus for more safety and spend less money on rent.
College Freshman,1,"Clarksville is fairly small. There really isn't much to do. The mall is played out and all most people do is either party or go to the same club that's been shot at several times. I mean we have hookah and bars and that stuff, but for people who don't get into those things the best option is dinner and a movie. Or, just stay home altogether. If you want an ounce of fun, Nashville, which is an hour away, is the best option."
College Junior,1,"In this department of registration process the workload falls on the students to make sure they are consistently checking he statues of turn in documents, etc."
College Sophomore,1,I used to live in non-traditional housing on campus (Emerald Hill). The apartments are small and not very clean. The most annoying part is that the strict guidelines apply to the non-trad housing just like the dorms-which meant we weren't allowed to drink and had to be subject to monthly inspection.
College Freshman,1,Austin Peay Is Very Selfish They Are Taking Your Money And Building New Dorms (Even Though We Already Have Like 8) and A New Football Stadium (For The Team That Only Won 1 Game This Year). They Could Care Less About The Students Needs All Of My Financial Aid Came From The State.
College Freshman,1,The Sports SUCK Especially The Football Team This Year Out Of The Whole Season They Won 1 Game And We Were Told That The School We Played Was Paid To Come And Let Us Win. SMH
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is atrocious and the number one complaint from students at Austin Peay. Many students carpool simply to avoid the trouble. If you have a parking pass, you can still only park in certain areas and they're always full. If you have to park, get to the school really early or about 30 minutes before your class."

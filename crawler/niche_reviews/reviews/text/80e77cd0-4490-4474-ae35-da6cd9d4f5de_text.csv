Graduate Student,5,My experience at Wiliam Carey has been great so far. The advisor and professor really care and are invested in my educational future and career. They really take the time sit and plan the next steps in regards to classes. The school itself is vibrant and full of diversity and keeps its students engaged. William Carey is a great place to receive your educational degree.

Freshman,5,"When I first went to visit William Carey I was nervous, but the atmosphere of the faculty and students made it feel like home. A couple years back the campus was hit by a tornado and seeing the community that came together to rebuild was amazing. I could not see myself anywhere else and I am glad to be able to call William Carey home."
Niche User,5,William Carey University is a great school with awesome professors. Professors are all so supportive and always willing to help when needed. William Carey offers a lot of phenomenal programs.
Alum,5,I loved the small Christian environment that nurtured my passions. The only downfall would be their contribution to helping you after graduation. They tend to leave you to figure things out on your own instead of forming those vital connections.
Freshman,5,"William Carey University has been by far the best experience of my life, mostly because it has become like Hogwarts for me. Every day feels magical with everything to do here, from involving in extra-curriculars to walking to classes. Besides that, the moral code of the college keeps it standing on solid ground, preventing any sort of bullying, obscene language or drug usage on campus. It is also a place to make some great friends and grow spiritually. I love this University; it is like Hogwarts to me."
Niche User,5,"The staff show you the most respect out of any college around. They invite you to come to events, to take personalized tours, and show how great a time you would have with them. They constantly stay in touch reaching out to make sure you have what you need.  The teacher to student ratio helps you feel more connected to not only the teachers but your class mates. They have a beautiful campus that has a new tatum court"
Graduate Student,5,"I am a 4th year medical student at WCU and my experience has been great.  WCU is cost competitive as far as medical schools go, the campus is attractive, and Hattiesburg was a great town of 50K to live in during my pre-clinical studies."
Junior,5,"William Carey has a wonderful, Christian atmosphere. It is welcoming and loving. The teachers ACTUALLY care about you."
Senior,5,"I thank God for such an amazing opportunity. I'm a non traditional student. Between working and being a Mom, I can actually find balance with the courses offered. The instructors are very understanding and compassionate. I appreciate the five week courses. I really wish they had more of those  to offer. I find coming to class is much more beneficial to me than on line classes."
Senior,5,William Carey University is a small Baptist University that offers small classes with high quality instructors. Tuition is competitive with other nearby universities and I believe I am being well trained for the next phase of my life.
Alum,5,"William Carey is a beautiful campus. It is always clean and looks great!  Great class courses offered. All the staff are such sweet souls, and the teachers are wondering. This is truely a wonderful school."
Sophomore,5,"William Carey is a great school for many reasons. The main two are the connections you make and the opportunities you have. The teachers are super personable. I have very good relations with all my teachers. Also, the school has many opportunities for you to get involved in. Through the school, I served as an intern in an ESL center in NYC this past summer. That opportunity has truly changed my life."
Graduate Student,5,"I have done both my undergarment and my graduate degrees at William Carey University, and I am 100% satisfied with all they have done for me. No school is perfect, but as a high school student coming to a college for the first time I was taken care of. I received my undergrad in History with a minor in Biblical Languages, and I adored every moment. I'm currently finishing my Master's in Ancient Imperialism and I am also loving it! I highly recommend WCU to anyone."
Graduate Student,5,I enjoy my experience at William Carey. The small class size and Christian atmosphere are awesome. The professors are helpful and understanding. William Carey welcomes those students who are non-traditional students. Their schedule is flexible and manageable.  The graduations ceremonies are short and professional.I am working on my fifth degree and can not think of a better school.
Graduate Student,5,"The instructors were knowledgable and professional, and the classes were challenging.  My advisor helped me every step of the way."
Freshman,5,"the place is like a home. since it  is a small university, everyone knows everyone so the place forms a family. people are really nice here and would be more than happy to help out the new student to adjust."

I have enjoyed the University so much, I plan to get my Masters here as well! I am beyond glad that I have chosen this University to fulfill my studies. The professors are beyond Amazing and I definitely feel as if they are the absolute best! William Carey went through a disaster on January 21, 2017 and the school has came together to defeat the odds against us. The tornado has taken a lot from the University but there is nothing we can't overcome!"
Freshman,5,"In my opinion, William Carey University gives you the most bang for your buck. It is also a great choice if you are looking for a quiet setting; if you like to party--not so much. Hattiesburg is a big change if you are from a small town (like me), but some of my friends from the area find it boring. There is a wide diversity of students who come from different faiths, backgrounds, and walks of life. If you are into sports, there is a wide array of opportunities. The academics are up to par, and the professors are highly qualified. Also, since Carey is such a small university, the professors can get to know students on a personal and individual level. The cafeteria is usually a hit or miss. It is either really good or really terrible. However, there are many restaurants in the area if the cafeteria food does not appeal to you. The dorms are nice and usually very clean. The student government association and other organizations are always providing activities and events for students."
Niche User,5,"At this point, I can only speak to the admissions process and my orientation to campus.  The admission process was smooth and the individuals involved were extremely helpful and professional.  I look foward to furthering my education here!"
College Sophomore,5,A degree from William Carey University is highly-valued by employers.
College Sophomore,5,"The school is a small campus, making it easy to get to know your classmates and professors. Because William Carey is a private university, the professors show interest in your grades, and work to encourage you."
College Sophomore,5,The registration process is fairly easy and faculty members work hard to make sure that the process goes by smoothly. They have a wide range of classes that rotate every trimester and the workload is average and works with the lives of the nontraditional students who are a majority at this campus.
College Sophomore,5,Very diverse campus with students of many different cultures and ages.
College Sophomore,5,"Good security. I feel very safe on this campus, even when I am leaving late at night from class."
College Sophomore,5,There is a variety of courses that students can enroll in. The teachers are very knowledgeable about the subject they teach and you can tell they really enjoy the topics.  All of the teachers have experience is the fields they are teaching and the classes are taught in a way that it is easy to follow.
College Sophomore,5,We are a small campus and because of this drug use isn't an issue that is seen on campus.
College Freshman,5,William Carey University is an excellent choice!
College Sophomore,5,The environment is really engaging and the professor really care not only for the students and the subjects they teach. Everyone on campus is super friendly and is always there to lend a helping hand. When i toured carey i simply fell in love with the art department and at that moment I knew i was destined to be a part of it. The down side of Carey in Hattiesburg would be the art department not having a building of their own as well as the proper supplies. Because of such drawbacks students have to work extra hard with what is available. What the art department does have is a great system of working and teaching students but I could be so much more . Aside from that I have learned so much and have thoroughly enjoyed William Carey university of Hattiesburg Mississippi.
College Senior,5,The advisors and professors are professional and caring. They truly care about their students' progress.
College Junior,5,"I have really enjoyed my first trimester at William Carey University.  The class have been excellent.  The teachers really care about the students learning the material.  The classes are also small, so the teachers teach on a more personal level."
College Sophomore,5,Attending this college has been a very good experience so far. The teachers are very enthusiastic about the subject they teach and they sincerely care about the students doing well and learning from the class so they can apply it to their lives. The night classes and the schedules also allow for me to have a part time job and attend college without there being any interferences or clashes in the schedules.
College Junior,5,The instructors are very personable and are so passionate about their students whether it be their learning experience or their personal lives. They're highly passionate about their work.
College Sophomore,5,"There are so many places to study on campus. From study rooms in the library to floor lounges in the dorms, you can always find peace and quiet to study. If you are a spiritual person like I am, Carey's Baptist Student Union offers weekly events for students."
College Sophomore,5,"As a biology major looking to go to medical school, I had a great opportunity with my work study job. I got to work in the office of the medical school on campus. I got to know several of the secretaries in the Dean's suite."
College Sophomore,5,"As a biology major looking to go to medical school, I had a great opportunity with my work study job. I got to work in the office of the medical school on campus. I got to know several of the secretaries in the Dean's suite."
College Junior,5,"Being a nursing major at William Carey is great. It's a 3 and a half year program, so it can be very stressful at times. However, all of the professors are willing to help all they can."
College Junior,5,"As far as I know, there has not been any crime on campus. Our security officers do a great job of keeping the campus safe. I always feel safe while I'm on campus."

College Freshman,5,Our security on campus always speak
College Freshman,5,Our campus is drug free

College Sophomore,5,We have a lot of diversity on campus.
College Sophomore,5,I love my college and the experiences!
College Sophomore,5,Its the best! We are a christian based college with campuslink nights and tons of student support.
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life is like having a whole extended family.  We get along with most everybody and have fun gatherings.  We are a cheerful fun-loving bunch.  There is not a special house or floor for the greeks, but who knows what the future holds."
College Sophomore,5,"The Business program is a great program when you are interested in working for yourself, becoming management, or for any company.  The workload is pretty normal and not too heavy.  We have trimesters, so classes seem to fly by.  There are lots of helpful people, information, and opportunities at William Carey University."
College Sophomore,5,It was very easy to get into the Business program. The administration is very helpful and makes it comfortable and easy to get started. The criteria is no different than most other colleges and the admission process is easy as well.
College Sophomore,5,The only person I have come in contact with was the tech guy and he is great.
College Sophomore,5,"The teachers are the best . They make it possible to carry the heavy workload. If you come to study and learn ,then you will make ."
College Sophomore,5,I have not really been involved with the sporting aspect of this school.
College Sophomore,5,They have a great deal of Christian social  get together s for the students .
College Sophomore,5,"My experience was great ,the women in the office were  a great help to me ."
College Sophomore,5,"Very good school ,it has honor and it sticks to its standards."
Junior,4,"Overall, I've had a good experience as a student attending William Carey University. Since COVID-19 has occurred and severely impacted the United States, there have been some may changes to occur. Some have been positive, but others have been negative, regarding increased requirements and additional cost."
Junior,4,"I am currently enrolled in my second online course at William Carey, and due to COVID-19, our theory/lectures for our core nursing courses are being conducted online as well. The platform for online learning is organized, efficient, and provides multiple options for communication such as; discussions boards, virtual appointments, and email."
Junior,4,I like the trimesters and short class time.  I would like to see advisers get more involved. I am currently on a break.  I plan to return when I save more tuition money and/or get scholarships.
Freshman,4,"Personally, I don't really like to take classes online, but during softball season I had to because we are barely on campus due to games. The teachers did a great job with working with us athletes on questions we may have had and they would even set up meeting in person if we need help on our assignment to ensure we had all the tools to successful."
Niche User,4,"I love the atmosphere, students, and the faculty. Everyone is nice and welcoming and I also love the diversity."
Senior,4,"The school is worth the investment into tuition for the most part. Campus is beautiful and the classes online are easy to take. I prefer not having to physically attend school, so I do appreciate that the non-traditional students are able to take a wide array of online only classes. It helps me as both an employee and a parent find time to fulfill my education as well."
Junior,4,"I loved my time at William Carey. I feel like I got a quality education from quality professors who care deeply about my success. I got a phenomenal education for the amount of money that I paid and I am thankful for all of the lessons I learned at Carey. The administration was difficult at times, but all universities have flaws and the pros substantially outweigh the cons at Carey. Beyond academics, I had opportunities to be involved in many extracurricular activities involving music, ministry, and community building. Overall, my time at Carey has given me innumerable opportunities to grow in leadership, spirituality, and social competence as well as intellect."
Sophomore,4,"Carey has a small-town, 13th year of high school feel. This allows one person to become well-known across campus. The professors are generally very invested in their students, which is a huge plus. Carey is not for everyone, though, and they are sadly behind in many ways, especially when it comes to their office systems. But I'd recommend it any day!"
Niche User,4,"When visiting William Carey University, I was very pleased on how the campus was so diverse. Every person I came across was very nice and welcoming. I honestly would not want anything to change about the school because it is find just the way it is."
Junior,4,"I attend William Carey University's newly established nursing program in Baton Rouge, LA. It's small and is just getting started, but so far it's been great. There isn't much of a campus, but there is a great learning environment."
Graduate Student,4,Great communication in the nursing field.  The advisors are prompt to respond to inquiries.  Classes are well thought out.
Junior,4,"William Carey is a university that I would recommend to anyone! It's a university, BUT it isn't a big campus! There is more one on one time with professors, and the classes aren't big at all. The BEST asset the university offers is that it runs off a trimester schedule so that makes the schooling a lot quicker than most."
Junior,4,I like how small the campus is. You're not just a number to your professors; they build a personal relationship with you.
Junior,4,I have enjoyed my time so far as a student at William carey. They have received and put through all of my financial aid applications in a timely manner and the professors for the most part are easy to talk to
Sophomore,4,"William Carey University is a growing college, with several unique and well qualified programs, such as the music therapy program and the health sciences such as nursing and physical therapy. The Student Government program and honors societies offer good options to get involved on campus. The professors are amazing, but administration can be a bit confusing at times. One of the few downsides is the cafeteria. The food is a bit mediocre, but I have seen significant improvement since my freshman year."
Freshman,4,"I like it here. It has a nice environment, the professors seem to care about every student. For me the tuition is expensive, I think that they could make minor adjustments in this area. The university offers petty much all extra curriculum activities  that every other schools in this area except for football. Other than that it is an good university to further your education."
Senior,4,"My experience at William Carey has been wonderful compared to other universities I've attended because the classrooms are smaller, the one on one teaching methods are easier to and the christian back ground of the school helps with the overall moral of the campus. However tuition is pretty pricey."
Sophomore,4,"I love the environment at William Carey. I enjoy the small size of the campus, and how safe it is at any time of the day."
Senior,4,"I enjoy the small class size. If you are having problems in your class, the instructor will help you."
Freshman,4,"William Carey is a great school, especially in academics. Is is a small university which means the professors know you by name and are able to give more attention to the success of the individual."
Freshman,4,"William Carey University is a small university, as far as surrounding universities go. It is very cozy, however it is quite expensive, considering the student's only have 10 weeks and are paying anywhere from $6,000-$8,000 for those 10 weeks. The staff is very friendly but you can tell that some are only there because they have to be. It is very under staffed, also. There are bio-chemistry majors teaching subjects like Anatomy and Physiology. They also need to focus on expanding facilities. Labs need to be added. It is however very friendly."
College Junior,4,I feel safe on my campus!
College Junior,4,Everyone was kind and willing to help.
College Junior,4,William Carey University is the best choice for me because it is geared to determined liked minded people who are interested in getting their degree done. WCU is based on terms rather than semesters so you really have to be diligent in your study habits.
College Sophomore,4,Security is great - I always feel safe on campus
College Sophomore,4,"The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. If you have issues at home, you are able to apply in the registrar's office. Application fee was only forty dollars."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics are an important factor in the school and most revolve around basketball, softball, and baseball."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are very friendly and encouraging.
College Sophomore,4,There is a vast majority of people on campus. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and has their own political beliefs.
College Sophomore,4,They offer a wide variety of academic classes upon any subject and subject level. They offer room rentals for student to students to use to have study groups. The registration process was a tad lengthy but it over all was a smooth process. One of the professor over that teaches art classes really studies us student so that they can understand us and how we learn. I really appreciate their passion for teaching students.
College Sophomore,4,The area outside of campus is unsafe but inside campus is like that of a safe haven. It's a safe environment with no need to worry about much because the secrurity staff is always around watching over those on campus.
College Freshman,4,Chemistry department is pretty bad
College Freshman,4,"Although you get the get education for your money's worth, it is a baptist college that is small which means the students are ""sheltered"" and are not prepared for the college life and real world."
College Junior,4,"William Carey, what can one say besides saying one thing, Christ. With what is going on with the world today and how people can not pray or even say Christian subjects without being criticized, it feels amazing to be at a school where Christ is their main focus. The administration accepts their students as family, understanding the students and helping them out in any way the can. I extremely felt welcomed the first day I arrived here. I brag about my University because it is a place to worship, to make memorable friends and to understand Christ and the life of that age. The education program is outstanding and the pride of the people for becoming who they want to be shows. Other universities should take not of this place, because no other can bet such a college as this one. Proud student of William Carey."
College Freshman,4,"William Carey has been a great experience over all. It escapes for the high school world and you are treated like a young professional. The classes are difficult but not impossible and because of the size of the campus it is not difficult to get from one to the other. The cafeteria food is that bad and Common Grounds is always an option. The professors are very friendly and the small class sizes are very nice. You can tell that everyone here is passionate about education. Due to the outreach programs over seas there is quite a diverse group of students even though the class sizes are quite large. There seems to always be something happening during he week to go to, but once the weekend comes around most people are off campus or in their dorms so you have to go into town if your looking for activities. Overall I am very pleased with William Carey."
College Junior,4,I really enjoy the small classes and having one-on-on time with the teacher.
College Sophomore,4,Small class size is great and there is a lot of new construction on campus.  Some of the dorms are older and outdated and need to be updated.
College Senior,4,"Teachers were great, learned a lot"
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of places to eat. The variety is great. Prices are affordable.
College Junior,4,"As a Christian college, WCU is very strict on a lot of things, but it's okay."
College Junior,4,I received a talent scholarship from my instructor after she reviewed my portfolio. It pays a lot and it helps so much.
College Freshman,4,The policy is always implemented and everyone follows the rules. I have not witnessed anyone going against the policy.
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid process went smoothly and the person in charge of all financial aid matters is very knowledgeable.  They have a decent amount of options from loans to scholarships and also work study programs.  In order to receive financial aid at my school one must first email, call, or visit the financial office on campus. Once there you will receive all assistance and guidance that you need in order to receive the financial assistance you are seeking."
College Senior,4,"I commute to school, commute home, study while taking care of my family, go to bed, wake up, and do it all over again.  My opinion on the ""nightlife"" and ""shopping"" aspects of this school are irrelevant."
College Senior,4,"I usually love my teachers, and they love teaching.  Class sizes are small.  Most teachers at the Hattiesburg campus genuinely want you to do well.  I have learned much."
College Sophomore,4,"This school is quite diverse when it comes to students of different nationalities. There are students for all of the earth like Germany, Nepal, and many other places."
College Junior,4,The scholarships that William Carey offers are really great. The financial aid process was easy.
College Junior,4,The career service center on campus does a great job of making the students aware of potential job opportunities near campus.
College Junior,4,"My overall experience with courses and professors has been great. Everyone is really helpful. The classes are fairly small which allows our professors more time to work with students individually if they need help. The courses have been challenging, but as long as I have done my best I have finished them with A's."
College Junior,4,"The professors at William Carey are extremely nice, and they are always willing to help. The classes tend to cover a lot of material in a short period of time because we are on the trimester system. Getting registered for classes is a fairly easy process. You pick up a list of all the classes available for that trimester and decide what you are going to need to take. Then you go talk to your adviser, and they will help you get everything set up. The most popular areas of study at William Carey seem to be Religion, Nursing, Education, and Music."
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of fast food restaurants off-campus, but there is also a wide variety of other restaurants. Many places offer discounts, and a lot of the places are already pretty inexpensive. OEC is one of my favorites. They have fantastic fried rice and sushi rolls. I can get two or three meals for about $6."
College Junior,4,"The area has many things to do. There are lots of restaurants near the campus, and the mall isn't very far away either. The area around the campus generally feels very safe. Many businesses near the campus offer special savings and such for William Carey students, and they also host events to support the school."
College Sophomore,4,William Carey gives out scholarships like candy on halloween
College Sophomore,4,"There is a good atmosphere of certain things, not much to do though."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is usually very nice and kind.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone gets along, and some of the people you live near will become your best friend"
College Sophomore,4,The security is amazing here. Overall safety is good
College Freshman,4,It's great.  Wish I was there when I first graduate
College Freshman,4,Very cool and friendly people at the school.
College Freshman,4,Will be doing a internship next year can't wait
College Sophomore,2,There are bad areas around the campus such as neighborhoods and at Carey WOW they encourage students to stay in groups when leaving campus to be safe.
College Freshman,2,The school campus does not have a dinning area of any kind.  The only options for snacks are the vending machines that are found in the front of the school. If anyone is looking for a meal they will have to drive across the street to get to the nearest restaurant.
College Sophomore,2,"Like all schools, it's a run around. You have people who apply for aid and loans and abuse it while others trying to figure out will they ever have money for books and even if they should just drop out."
College Senior,2,"This may (hopefully) change, but I've had some issues with the administration.  I have had trouble determining the value of a degree from WCU...but I hope it's of some value.  I sure have put a massive amount of effort, time, and money into this degree."
College Freshman,2,Since it's a religious school there is not a lot of partying and if there is people go to the local clubs in Hattiesburg. Hattiesburg doesn't have public transpiration so if people go they drive but they usually have a designated sober driver.
College Sophomore,2,"Well, it is a vocally Baptist university in southern Mississippi so what kind of progressive attitude can be expected. I know of school with much harsher rules than William Carey but they are relatively ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,"Well...It is a school in the deep South. A week ago I would have stopped my description right here and signed off with a ""Nuff said,"" but I have come to find a handful (but only a handful) of surprising thing about Hattiesburg. For one thing, there is a farmer's market...IN-TOWN! This is a huge deal as the stereotypes often associated with poor standards of southern health consciousness are proven at every turn in Hattiesburg. Also, there are a few (but just a few) sprinkles of progressive shopping. T-Bone Records (half-cafe, half-record store) reminds me of the diverse, easy-going Denver coffee shop scene where intellectual thought and community is welcome and supported. I also found out about a couple of PLANT NURSERIES! THAT blew my head off. Hattiesburg is also nicknamed 'Hub City' because it's under 100 miles from Jackson, Mississippi Gulf Coast, Mobile, and New Orleans. In certain areas, Hattiesburg is surprisingly pleasant, for Mississippi. All in all, though, it's mostly just a a slightly-below-decent college town."
College Senior,2,Not many places to eat close by.
College Senior,2,"For the William Carey- tradition campus, there isn't a student center or a ""hangout"" spot. It's a small campus with no cafeteria and small library."
College Senior,2,"The campus very diverse. However, some of the students seem to be less sociable. They tend to stick to themselves or who they know. Some students are cliquish. But doesn't bother me to much. I'm a relative talkative person & I talk to everyone."
College Senior,2,"I don't use the computer lab too often because I use my own computer device. However, I haven't had an issue with the computer labs when I needed to access a  computer very quickly. The printing is ridiculous. They have a print card and its almost .20 per sheet. That's insane."
College Senior,2,I attend a non traditional campus in which dorms are not offered and students live locally of campus. This question does not really apply to the type of campus I attend.
College Senior,2,I KEEP FORGETTING OUR SCHOOL PARTICIPATES IN SPORTS
College Senior,2,"My first advisor told me that she just did not think that nursing was for me.  I got discouraged and dropped out of the program.  My second advisor told me to just drop out because I was going lose my financial aid for failing my spring 2012 semester.(Admitted into trauma at the hospital for septic shock...almost died...had I not came in that night, I would have passed in my sleep)..no forgiveness what-so-ever or willingness to  work with me on AT LEAST allowing me ""incompletes"" instead.  I had to take my complaint to the academic dean, who is also my disabilities coordinator that protects me and my rights.  Now, the advisor (assigned to me as my third advisor) tell me that she does not see how I can possibly graduate in may of 2012.  I have the second highest (dean's list) academic scholarship that requires a mininum of 3.7 GPA to earn, and a minimum 2.5 GPA to keep.  Each term, I am knocked down, and at the end of that term, I turn around and knock  THEM down  with ANOTHER ""A""."
College Junior,2,Limited Living Areas – There are very limited areas to find within 5 or 10 minutes of the school to live. Most people commute to and from the campus because of this.
College Junior,2,"Many Opportunities for Baptists and Other Christians – William Carey University is a very religious school. There are numerous options for young Christians who want to worship God, get involved in the community, or even go on mission trips. Anybody who does not have a strong emphasis on religion in his or her life will kind of feel out of place at WCU."
College Junior,2,"This is a fairly new campus for non-traditional students.  There isn't much to offer, yet.  The library is small.  We have a small lounge area but other than that we have nothing else to offer."
College Sophomore,1,"To live in a safe and clean environment, prices become very/too expensive. The off-campus housing nearby are mainly for very low income families. The landlords/management don't too much consider college students who are trying to make it unless they have children to support too."
College Sophomore,1,"If you do not have a car on this campus, or even in this city, you will likely lose you mind. It is far isolated to walk anywhere. Mostly because we are all bored out of our minds TOGETHER, you can likely have someone drive you here and there. But for a college student (with a valid driver's license), this can take a negative toll on your sense and exercise of your growing responsibility and independence. From what I hear, the public bus system runs well for a small town but I have only ever seen a bus twice in 6 months! If you would like your own sanity and independence, YOU NEED A CAR! End of story. But without a car, you can't have them both."
College Sophomore,1,we do not have a health facility on campus . The police make sure the campus is well surveyed every night .
College Junior,1,"I have not lived on campus at Carey in a long time, but they were very strict on alcohol and tobacco use, which I am fine with because the majority of college students are not old enough to drink alcohol anyway.  The annoying part was the dorm checks.  Dorm visitation policy was ridiculous, though; my boyfriend was NEVER allowed in my dorm--he went to another school and had his own apartment, so we would go there.  (We ended up getting married :) )"
College Junior,1,"HORRIBLE.  The food is low quality and for someone who is interested in eating as healthy as possible...it is IMpossible to do at Carey.  NO organic options and very few vegetarian options.  The salad bar is awful.  And the only place to get food on campus is in the cafeteria, which has terrible hours."
College Junior,1,"WCU is very diverse--especially for its size.  There are students from Jamaica, several European countries, China, and India.  However, the majority of students are a mix of black and white Americans...and that has not always been the case.  Only recently (within the last 20 years or so) have the number of black students risen."
College Student,1,"There is only 1 security guard available at all times, and there are hardly any security cameras. The security guard sits in a booth at the entrance of the school, usually watching movies or talking on the phone."
College Junior,1,We don't have any transportation at Carey. We do have a public city bus but safety is an issue.
College Junior,1,"I wouldn't mention sexual orientation at this school at all unless you wish to be badgered and bullied.   Also any religion other than a christian oriented one is not acceptable, as well as this strong liberal political beliefs should be kept to oneself.  Really unless you want to keep your mouth firmly closed the entire time you are attending this school, like myself, don't attend it at all."
College Senior,1,"There are not any NPH Greeks here... There are only small, private sororities and fraternities."
College Senior,1,"Should Have Stayed at a Community College – If I could turn back time I would NEVER have chosen WCU for nursing. This school is a scam and accepts everybody who applies. They get you into the school and sell you a dream of nursing. 250 people will take the entrance test and only 30 will be accepted and another 30 will be placed on the waiting list. The entire selection process is based on that one test not academic course work. If a person scores a higher on the entrance test, but has a lower GPA than you, they will be first pick. Then they chose 30ppl for the waiting list, might I add, they never inform you if you have been selected or not, your just left hanging. I think it would be considerate if the school would inform the individuals on the waiting list, via mail or email about their waiting status. Then the school will deny the individuals on the waiting list the following trimester. This did not only happen to me but MANY others as well. 
The school will accept you into their pre-nursing curric., take your money (very expensive private schools & my parents pay for my schooling out of pocket) deny you for the nursing program and advise you to get a useless Bach. in General Studies or Psychology degree which is another 3 to 4 trimesters. I applyed to another school and was accepted to a accelerated nursing program on my first try. Many others students have also applied to other local schools and have been accepted with no problem. If one is seeking a psychology or general studies degree then I would advise you to look into this school. Otherwise, Please take it from me DO NOT GO TO THiS SCHOOL FOR NURSING."
College Senior,1,Out Dated – Theirs only six computer in the whole school and they are very out dated. Sometime you might have to wait hours until a computer is available.

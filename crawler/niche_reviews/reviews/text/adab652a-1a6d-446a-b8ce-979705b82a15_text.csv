Junior,5,I've enjoyed my time at Cypress College. The Theatre program is amazing! They teach students how to appreciate all aspects of the arts. All performers of the entire cast must volunteer in some way to benefit the overall production. This encourages multiple artistic talents as well as respect for other styles of the craft.

Freshman,5,"Due to Covid-19, I am still able to communicate with my professors for my first semester. I am currently taking and am enrolled in 13 units which isn't all so bad unless I choose not to do the work load, but I know I'll do it so not doing it is no option."
Freshman,5,"I am currently attending Cypress college and I am looking forward in joining multiple clubs including: Associated Students, Business Club, and the Honors club for some involvement. I a glad that Cypress also has to offer athletics for example I enjoy playing volleyball and I was able to connect with the Head Coach as we talked about recruitment in being part of the team. Hopefully I do get in."
Senior,5,Cypress College has given me a second opportunity. It's iconic tall and gray-concrete buildings and great environment bring a certain zen and peace. The school is full of opportunities for all students and has great staff of professors.

Freshman,5,Easy and self explanatory. Professor Reed (History) really made it enjoyable and easy for me during summer classes.
Sophomore,5,The professors here are absolutely amazing. They really go above and beyond to help you succeed in class. I haven't had one professor yet that has given me a bad experience.
Sophomore,5,"I love this school for so many reasons. I decided to attend college later in life when I was 26. I thought that it was going to be hard, but Cypress college has made the process so easy. They really care about their students and provide so many services in order to help individuals achieve the goals they set in place. All the professors I have taken truly care about their students and go out of the way to help them pass the class. It has been an amazing experience so far and I'm so excited to see what my future years here will bring."

Alum,5,Thank you to the amazing professors who have taught me valuable lessons that I will use in and out of the classroom!
Freshman,5,"My experience here has been really nice, their campus is really well laid out and they usually have out food trucks that smell amazing. I can't wait to try the lovely food. They also have a nice grassy area by the food trucks."
Sophomore,5,Cypress College was a great choice for me. The professors were extremely personable and easy to get along with. They showed true passion for what they were teaching and I knew they cared about all of their students. Cypress offers many services to all of their students including a free tutoring center for everybody enrolled in classes. I got a great base there and it made me ready to move on to a 4 year university.
Sophomore,5,"During my 2 years at Cypress the only online classes I took were during the Covid-19 crisis. It was a big shock to everyone including the professors, but they did a great job at transferring to online teaching and they made the students feel like they were still in class. The teachers worked extremely hard and made the online transition as easy as possible."
Sophomore,5,"I liked the teacher to student ratio, in most of my classes I was able to get one on one help from the professors. I really enjoyed playing Women’s basketball for the athletic department as my coach is very motivational. I got help with everything from financial aid to how to get my books to attending transfer center meetings with people from the 4 year universities. I don’t think it needs to many changes just the books are a bit overpriced as every college book is."
Sophomore,5,"Great college with faculty that only wants to see it's students grow. The students that attend are great and give a welcoming and caring environment, the campus feels very safe and there are no incidents that I have seen reported. Great DSS and EOPS offices as well as the bookstore and library however, I can not speak on the food as I have not tried it since the food trucks were removed."
Sophomore,5,"Cypress College is the most amazing college campus I have ever been to. Perhaps it isn't the flashiest campus but the students, professor, and faculty are so inspiring, friendly and helpful."
Sophomore,5,Cypress college campus is very safe and relaxing. I love the pond near the library. There is also a lot of good food option around the campus.
Freshman,5,Nice campus and great quality college in California. There are varieties of centers that are always available to support students. New students are welcomed and guided very closely. This is my second semester in Cypress College and I am very excited to be a student here.
Senior,5,"This is the best community college by far! I have attended Fullerton and Cerritos as well. This campus just blows the others out of the water! The counselors are so friendly, easy to reach via appointments/walk-ins/online, helpful, and just amazing. I have had so much support from many professors and staff in the main office. There are a lot of resources for whatever it is you may specifically need! The school layout is so unique, including the pond and the ducklings that live on campus as well! I'm so glad I have spent the majority of my semesters on this campus! I honestly recommend this school to anyone and everyone!!!"
Sophomore,5,Cypress College has been a great j.c. to attend! I've taken many classes there and the professors are great! The counselors and staff are helpful and will point you in the right direction.
Sophomore,5,Cypress college is a great school to start your academic journey. The campus itself is very clean and accessible to anyone in school and the staffs are very kind and helpful. Most of the professors are very warm and helpful and care about students.
Sophomore,5,The environment is very positive. The professors encourage their students to be their best selves and always want education to flow through them.
Niche User,5,"Cypress College has definitely prepared me to go into the workforce by helping me gain industry certifications and more. It is very safe, and has many places to work, including a computer lab open almost all the time."
Freshman,5,"Cypress college is amazing. The professors, and staff take the time to ensure your academic success. As a late start college student, this college motivates me to pursue higher education, and to get my degree in film. If there is anything i would change it would be the lack of a operational cafeteria."
Freshman,5,Cypress College is a bigger than average community college. It kind of gives students a University type of experience without the sororities and fraternities and what not. Going to Cypress College is a choice I definitely do not regret.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy how quiet and clean the campus is. Resources are always available and classes tend to be not as compact as a typical college would be. The staff are very helpful, they know their material well."
Junior,5,"I had a great experience in Cypress College! The programs I got involved in really helped me financially as well as academically. I really felt like I belonged here and the support I got through programs and the general facilities in the Learning Resource Center allowed me to climb from a mentality of being a ""C"" student to being an ""A"" student. More than just a place to finish my general education classes, Cypress College has helped me build a new, more determined mindset--I can get this degree, and I will."
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus with easy to locate classrooms, decent parking space for a college. Awesome resources nearby. Highly educated and patient professors."
Freshman,5,"Cypress College is really interactive with students. Especially for students in STEM fields, a program is available that is intended to help STEM students in and out of college. As for my professors, I feel that they actually care about my well-being and success in their class."
Sophomore,5,I can honestly say that Cypress College has made a huge impact on my life. The programs on campus are truly some of the best. The student support services office will change your life! The staff is amazing and everyone there treats you like family. The only thing I didn't like about college and I would like to see changes in the cafeteria. It wasn't convenient for me to get food on campus because it was expensive and mostly fast food.
Senior,5,"In my four years attending Cypress College, no other college has come in comparison like this one. From the interactions with the faculty to the students and with my professors it has been great."
Sophomore,5,"I am really not liking the construction going on, but other than that, this campus is great! I am a sophomore and loving it. Join clubs or an academic program. I have not paid for textbooks in the past year and a half thanks to stem^2!"
Sophomore,5,"Cypress College offers many resources to help students succeed. I have had a great experience here, and have found the proper resources from staff every step of the way."
Sophomore,5,Cypress College is a great school to start off college life. Many professors care for the students like we are their own. I would recommend Cypress College to anyone who is looking for a community college home.
Sophomore,5,Quality education at a fraction of what would be payed at a State University. Everyone is fairly friendly and the campus safety is always patrolling the campus. The psychology department enriches your learning experience with knowledgable professors who are experts in their fields of study.
Freshman,5,"Although the campus is really small, the staff is very friendly and there are many different programs available for a wide range of students."
Sophomore,5,I like that Cypress College is a very diverse place. The teachers are very friendly and easy to get access of. The campus is also very nice.
Freshman,5,Every class I take there is a dedicated professor that wants to see me succeed. The campus is continuously being remodeled so that it is as modern as possible. It is the #1 community college in Southern California.
Sophomore,5,The teachers here have believed in me and supported me more than any teacher has. If you want to attend a community college Cypress is the way to go.
Freshman,5,I like how many classes there are about different topics along with all the materials that are added onto it.
Sophomore,5,"I have had a great experience at my time at Cypress College.The connections I've made with with my peers and professors are ones I will cherish for the rest of my life. When I arrived at Cypress College for my first semester, I came in feeling worried and nervous about entering a new school, I left the first week feeling great and eager to learn. In my second year now, I still have this same eagerness and enthusiasm about school as I had leaving my first month. Overall, the great atmosphere at Cypress College has really allowed me to thrive."
Alum,5,They had a wonderful automotive program that allowed people to go to the automotive industry by getting an interview with Toyota or Lexus. The school was very modern and allowed many opportunities for students to learn and also to see the different colleges and universities.
Sophomore,5,After high school I went straight to Cypress College and right when I registered for my classes I was very excited and was not nervous at all. I finished my first year with a great success because of Cypress College. They have many helpful resources such as the Math Learning Center also known as the MLC. The MLC had tutors to help those who struggle with math or if you simply just have a simple question they're their for you. The MLC helped me through my first year of college and they are one of the reasons on why my first year was such a big success for me. They also provide private tutoring and it's very helpful. Cypress college needs to change and update their WiFi because many students want to kill time doing homework and students need a better WiFi to do that because everything we do is through the internet and we need things to be working fast.
Sophomore,5,"This is an amazing school. It's cheap. It's currently at 46 dollars per unit. The people here are friendly, the city is quiet, and there aren't a lot of things going on. Parking isn't too terrible, and in this year of 2019, it's placed at 40 dollars per semester while summer semester has it at 20. The professors here clearly care about their students and they're not interested in seeing anyone fail."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshmen at cypress college. So far, cypress has a very kind and helpful staff. Their campus is beautiful and clean. Everybody there is really kind also. They have so many classes to choose from. The teachers there are very helpful. The counselors always are ready to help you and answer your questions and direct you in what you need to do in order to succeed. They always want to help the students and make sure they reach their goals that they want."
Alum,5,Professors were very welcoming and willing to help out students in need! Very clean campus and active in regards to student life and activities on campus. Safety around campus makes students feel secure. Access of resources were convenient. Guidance counselors were amazing at making sure students meet goals to graduate!
Graduate Student,5,What I liked about Cypress College was the amount of resources the institution had to offer. Any time that I felt stuck on something I always could find some type of aid through the school such as the math lab and the tutoring centers. I wouldn't change anything about this college.
Freshman,5,The really friendly staff and counselors always so helpful. The staff makes you feel welcome and help you to the best of their ability.
Freshman,4,"I have taken all my classes online because of Covid, and the professors try very hard to give you all the resources needed. There are also mental health programs that aim at ensuring students feel safe and have a place to stay during these hard times. The school is very understanding of the different situations people are in at the moment and try their best to work with everyone to ensure everyone gets an education which is not common for a community college."
Senior,4,The professors have taken on this pandemic as a challenge and have complied with state procedures to give students the best academic experience via online.
Sophomore,4,"Cypress College is a well-organized community college. It is good for those wanting to continue their education but may be unsure where to start. There are a number of services available to multiple student demographics. The staff, especially in the counseling center, will do all they can to support their students' academic and career goals."
Sophomore,4,"First and foremost, it is most important for students to check Rate MyProfessor to see whether that professor and their online course is right for you. Doing so allowed me some insight into what to expect from the online courses. Prior to the start of the class the professors/courses I took, sent welcome emails with the syllabus attached days before the class begun. Then, throughout the semester would send weekly reminders about assignment due dates. They also reminded students about virtual office hours showing how accessible they are to help us succeed in their class."
Alum,4,"Because of COVID 19 I ended up taking all my courses online, but I had experience with this because I have taken online courses in the past. My advice, stay organized when taking online courses! Write down your due dates and stay on top of your work don't wait till the 11:59pm deadline you will stress yourself out. Stay in touch with your academic advisor and use your resources."
Sophomore,4,The reason I give it 4 stars is because they have great counseling. The counselors actually know what they're doing and prepare you for transfer or the classes you need to take. The Professors are okay I mean most college professors aren't good anyways. I'd highly suggest if you're thinking of going to Cerritos College or Lakewood I'd go to Cypress College. I mean it's the #1 in California so why not?
Sophomore,4,"I liked how Cypress College has a very safe and beautiful campus. Professors are mostly very ambitious and eager to teach the students without wasting time. However, some of the general counselors at Cypress is very rude from my experience. I understand that they have overwhelming number of students, but I do not understand the attitudes toward the students."
Senior,4,Good college to go to they have good education system. Most of the professors are nice and understanding. They are a lot off support from the school. They have many resources and make your collage life easier.
Sophomore,4,I attended Cypress College for 2 years. I enjoyed most of the classes I took. The school has many resources that students can take advantage of and the professors there are very dedicated. The overall experience was good and it is a good school to transfer from to a 4 year university.
Sophomore,4,"I only took online classes when the entire semester shifted to the online format due to the covid-19 situation. While it was an adjustment, the professors tried very hard to transition it like a regular class. The online format was not like the in person class, but the classes continued until the end of the semester. The online format at Cypress College was a good experience."
Sophomore,4,"I’ve taken a mix of in person and online classes at cypress. The online classes I took were excellently taught and I always had great communication with my professors. We had conferences , and discussions so that it could stay active. Due to COVID-19 the rest of our spring 2020 semester had to be remote so some teachers who don’t usually teach online had to this time. The teachers that transitioned from in person to online did an outstanding job. They tried their hardest to get us all the information we needed , tried to organize everything and set up conferences with the class ."
Senior,4,Cypress college is a a great all around campus. Nice library to be able to study in peace and the have great programs including STEM. Parking is not a problem and professors are a hit or miss depending how passionate you are about the class.
Junior,4,"My time at cypress college has been great. I love the staff, especially one in particular, Professor Landis. She is a really amazing chemistry professor and knows her information. The atmosphere there is good, you sit down and someone else ask if they can sit at you table too and you start a conversation with the individual."
Sophomore,4,I liked most of the professors here and its a good transition between high school and universities. The one thing I would like to see changed is the really bad professors should be let go.
Freshman,4,"It's a very pleasant institute to attend. Professors teach very well and are very fun to talk to. The college wants the best for me as I want for myself and through their guidance, I am currently on track to transferring to my dream school. Programs are phenomenal and provide so much help and guidance for the students based on their needs."
Sophomore,4,"Cypress College has a beautiful campus and very friendly professors. However, the administration is a bit unorganized. Every break between semesters I get an email about how they lost something. I also get emails that tell me I have to take certain classes for a program I'm not enrolled in."
Freshman,4,"The campus is overall is pretty good. There are two buildings under construction currently, so it is kind of bothersome to have to deal with the constant noise. Other than that, the campus is really nice and there is a lot of parking spaces."
Freshman,4,Cypress is a clean well kept school. The parking isn't bad and the safety on campus seems good too. However it's very hard to get into classes because its very congested. Long wait lists for almost every class has led me to take classes in LA.
Freshman,4,"My first semester at Cypress College has been a genuine learning experience. So far the staff have been incredibly helpful and kind. I've enjoyed my classes. However, the general atmosphere at the college is boring. I would suggest more campus activities in order to bring livelihood to the campus."
Sophomore,4,"I like the environment of Cypress College. We have a variety of help and a good  support when you reach for it. Communication between counselors and classes are not very well, for me they should know everything about (most of ) the classes. I like the pond that we used to have and now it is in construction, I hope I like it since that is the main reason I came to this college."
Junior,4,"The general counselors seem to not be on the same page when it comes to transferring and what courses you should take. Luckily for STEM majors, we have our own counselors that help guide us and make us feel more confident in the transferring process."
Sophomore,4,"I have been with Cypress College for about three years, and I have had a great time exploring my major before I transfer to a four-year university. It has a diverse set of courses that is applicable to many different majors. Student life at Cypress College offers clubs for specific majors. I am involved in the STEM Club, which provides STEM majors to make friends with like-minded individuals. Opens the opportunity to volunteer, form peer groups, study groups, workshops, internships at local companies and abroad, and offers links and advice to get research opportunities at Universities. Starting your academic career at Cypress College is a great way to ensure what major you want to pursue before you get to university."
Sophomore,4,"Overall I have had excellent teachers and excellent classes. The college consistently updates students about the campus - including safety, construction, and events - so I always know what is going on with the school."
Freshman,4,"Cypress College is a good college for people that want to transfer to a Cal state or a University. If I had taken this college longer, I don't think it is great for long term if your major classes are not offered a lot. I major in CS and the classes here so far are great for academic sense and stressful if you want to party at the same time. CS classes are not offered a lot. Java classes have few teaches in comparisons to Eng and Math classes that have more than at least 8 teachers. I've had my fair share of both sides and I think academic wise it is great and party scene not so much. Making friends here is also hard as many people are open to their friends than new-comers. I recommend making friends outside of this college to make up for the loneliness."
Sophomore,4,"Cypress College used to be a pretty campus but right now there's nothing but construction which sort of makes it an eye-sore. The professors are very knowledgeable and respectable, I haven't had a super terrible professor yet which is surprising for I'm close to my 5th semester here at the school."
Freshman,4,Cypress college's campus is very clean and the staff and teachers are helpful. There are a variety of clubs to join and many opportunities to explore your field of interest.
Sophomore,4,"I was honestly surprised at how great some of the professors are at Cypress College. For instance, Janet Owen Driggs, who teaches Art History and Art Gallery Studies, is a mentor that I hope to stay in contact with for many years to come. She helps set up her students for success in the work force, and her practical approach helps students come out of their shell and blossom into true professionals. Stuart Rosenberg from the English department is another gem. I took screenwriting with him, and the well-organized class encouraged students to be in the zone and write every day. His assignments weren't just busy work; they were actually well thought out projects to help drive students towards a larger goal of a successful screenplay."
Freshman,4,"So far I have had a great experience at cypress college , it founds commuinty and welcomes all. I have seen many good things and had a good experience as it is as a college freshman ."
Sophomore,4,What I really liked about Cypress College was how easy they made my transition from high school to college. I thought that I would have trouble with finding classes but the Charger Experience Program helped me with my first two semesters at Cypress College.
Sophomore,4,"I have encountered professors that only care about shaming students for not having the mastery of subjects that they themselves have a doctorate in. On the other hand it is much more common to have the most caring and compassionate, and passionate professors that go above and beyond to reach their students. The professors at Cypress College care about their students, and prepare them for success at University level."
Alum,4,"I loved being at Cypress College. I was thriving with my education. I felt that I was really learning in my classes. It's a nice campus which added to the overall positive environment. If I could, I would stay there to finish my Bachelor's degree."
Junior,4,"I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT DURING MY TIME WITH CYPRESS COLLEGE, I WAS ABLE TO BECOME READY TO TRANSFER TO A 4 YEAR. THE COUNSELORS ON THIS CAMPUS ARE HELPFUL BUT A CON IS THAT THEY ARE VERY BUSY. THIS CAMPUS WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING AND EVERYTHING WAS CLOSE BY AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE. MY OVERALL EXPERIENCE WITH CYPRESS COLLEGE WAS A GREAT ONE AND RECOMMEND OTHER STUDENTS TO ATTEND IN THE FUTURE"
Freshman,4,"I have just completed 1 year at Cypress College & I can honestly say that it has been quite a ride. Coming in as a first-generation college can be very intimidating & frightening. Cypress College offers many clubs & programs to help the students feel welcomed on campus, which was extremely helpful. However, I do believe that the campus could improve on their outdoor seating. There are chairs and tables around campus but I would love it if the campus put more effort into putting more creative seating all around campus."
Sophomore,4,"Cypress college is the best! There is a lot of help but the ones the help you out the most is EOPS. If you qualify for EOPS they will give you school materials such as pens, binders, scantrons and you can even rent calculators. Also, they loan books and even give you money for books. All you have to do is attend 3 sessions every semester with a counselor. However, regular counselors should do better in helping you. I fell like they confuse you and don't really help you much."
Sophomore,4,I would like to see some better professors. They need to be more organized. The quality of teaching just needs to be better.
Sophomore,4,"Cypress College has a lot of good programs offered on their campus, like tutoring services for math and English. The professors are very helpful, caring, and encouraging. They really put their efforts into assisting their students with passing classes and earning their degree. I enjoy coming to classes at this school."
Sophomore,4,It is quite alright. It doesn't exactly pop out of any aspect although there are great programs here. Programs consist of STEM^2 or EOPS which helps students pay for books as well as give counseling which is much appreciated.
Freshman,4,"So far, I felt like I was given a lot of help and advice for my future. I can't wait to start my year and see which of the other staff are amazing."
Graduate Student,4,cypress college is a beautiful campus. It  has some of the best professors. and has many resources for students.
Junior,4,I loved the professors at Cypress College and the services that some classes were provided with; class tutoring.
Alum,4,I loved so much. Right out of high school I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and after talking with the counselors here it really helped me find my path to Physical therapy. The professors here are very professional and truly care about their students. most of the professors have multiple courses they teach and if you create a good relationship with them then it really pays off as you continue in your major studies.
Sophomore,4,"Cypress college teaching staff is very approachable. Cypress makes it well known, all of the programs and departments that are available to utilize for various needs that come up for my student career."
Sophomore,4,Good School to start a career and good for transfer. Do what you got to do and you'll do great. Have something in mind so you don't stay at the school for multiple years just wasting money.
Graduate Student,4,The campus is very well maintained and the security are always available. Computer labs are up-to-date and the lab technician is so helpful. The public areas are clean.
Sophomore,4,"Cypress College has great professors and supportive staff. The campus is small but beautiful. My only complaint is the lack of student involvement. While Cypress College tries to get students involved in clubs and other fun on-campus activities, participation can at times be somewhat lacking."
Senior,4,I plan on going to cypress college for two years to earn all my credits needed to become a social worker. This scholarship will benefit me with my career so I can achieve and go to the next level that’s needed.
Freshman,4,"The campus is really clean and there's not much litter around. I really enjoy the professor's too as they genuinely seem like they want you to do well in their courses. Some professors even include their phone number and personal email as a means to contact them faster as opposed to their college email. Personally, I think that shows a lot because professors are constantly flooded with emails. What I would like to see differently is a more courses with different times. I feel as if there are more morning classes compared to the afternoon or night. This way most courses could fit in a student's schedule. I've actually had to substitute or drop courses because it simply couldn't fit in my schedule as I do have younger brother's to take care of. But other than that, I've really enjoyed Cypress College as a Freshman and I'm really looking forward to finishing strong and transferring to a University."
Sophomore,4,"Cypress College is a great school. It has great facilities, faculty, and opportunities for extracurricular work in and outside of the school. There are lots of clubs and many majors and programs to take.  Cypress offers great counseling advice for students who know what they want to do.  Food on campus is ok and stays at relatively the same price point as other local restaurants. Cypress Baseball is quite competitive and has seen several students enter major leagues, which is cool to know. Cypress is a great campus that will prepare you for the future and beyond."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed the professors I had at Cypress College. There were a few that went the extra mile for their students and made it a point to be available by email or phone if you ever needed help. Even when I was having a rough time, by communicating with them I was able to succeed. Cypress could be improved if the Learning Resource Center was open longer."
Sophomore,4,"Cypress college is a very small, navigable campus with a great STEM program. The overall environment is good, but I would like to see more than one class/professor available per semester for my major classes. It is easy to make equally driven aquaintences via the STEM program, and there are a lot of opportunies for research introduced through this program. This is a great community college for aspiring STEM majors."
Freshman,4,"Very Comfortable with great professors. I am very satisfied about the school and gets me ready for UCs and CSUs. I am learning a lot, not only academically but also as aspect in social skills and communication."
Sophomore,4,"Cypress is a great college. I've never been so enthusiastic about school until I graduated high school. I absolutely love the energy and the people I am surrounded with. I never thought I wanted to go to a Community, but now that I have been here for 3 semesters I can proudly say that I love Cypress College. The teachers, programs, and students really make the difference."
Sophomore,4,"I very much enjoyed both the Study Abroad and S.T.E.M programs offered by the college. The professors are knowledgeable and insightful instructors, who have provided me with a great baseboard with which to move on to university."
Niche User,4,I am a high school senior but I have already had some good experiences with Cypress College. I like that they offer Dual Enrollment classes to Cypress High School's students because it benefits students in the long run. I also like how they plan college day events such as when the Seniors got to attend a field trip to Cypress College for a day recently.
Freshman,4,Cypress college has an amazing staff with the attitude to help everyone reach their goals and move forward to the next step!
Junior,4,"The school has a nice environment and lovely professors. The counselors are really helpful, but you need to use them in order for them to help you. The transfer center is also a great resource for those looking to continue their education."
Junior,4,"Cypress College provides a great environment for learning, while providing great student support programs."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Cypress College is that they offer many resources that helps with study. For example, the library has most of the books that are required for the classes I'm taking. Cypress College also has a student learning center where they help students with their homework or anything they don't understand. They also offer free tutoring which is very helpful. Overall, I think that Cypress College is a great community college."
Sophomore,4,I have really enjoyed my experience at Cypress. The Science program at Cypress is incredible. The only downside to Cypress is their choice of an Organic Chemistry Professor- they would have gotten 5 stars if they didn't have such a terrible OChem professor. The counselors are friendly and I've never felt confused or alone.
Sophomore,4,"I am attending Cypress College, and have found their resources to be very helpful. My professors are decent, and I am able to ask them questions during their office hours. Academically, the education that I am receiving here is good quality. However, I do not like the food. The french fries and pizza are fine, but I don't like the rest of it. There is a good student body here, and there are activities each semester. Overall, the college is very reasonable for everyone. I would recommend this community college to anyone."
Junior,2,"It may be due to the pandemic, but most professors who teach primarily in person had to switch to online teaching. I am not blaming any professors, however; understanding there is much more work involved with online learning. I would hope some professors would try a bit harder to engage with their students. Teaching as if we were sitting in class doesn't cut it. Please don't waste our money and make learning fun."
Sophomore,2,"I love my time here, but departments like Financial Aid need to get their act together. I've had nothing but issues with that department and can't wait to transfer!"
Graduate Student,2,"The campus environment is great. The professors I had so far are great at what they do and are open-minded in helping student getting to where they need to go. However, when I went to go meet with a representative of the school I do not feel welcome and unsatisfied. For example, when I met with a counselor or called the school for information I feel rush by the representative. The tone of their voice made me feel unwelcome and it was obvious they were irritated at me for calling them.  If the representative acted more professional it would have made my school experience more memorable.  I do not feel confident going to the counselors for help because of the way I was treated (more than one occasion)."
College Senior,2,Not much to say about this. Students are on there own on this. You got to ask around.
College Freshman,2,"It's difficult with my situation, I find it more of an uphill battle trying to find the funds to continue my education."
College Junior,2,There is a lot of waiting the the counselors are helpful. 
College Sophomore,2,I do not learn anything in some of my classes. My teachers are not clear at times and sometimes they do not even know how to do the problem they are teaching.
College Junior,2,"We have a good student center and library. However, there are not very many copies of the text books for the classes and some o the books are not in the library. I think they should have tutors available."
Recent Alumnus,2,It seemed like the only financial aid outside of FAFSA-based aid that was available was designated for non-white races. I was told I didn't qualify for anything at all.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I did not qualify for financial aid, although my parents struggled to put me through community college."
College Senior,2,"The computer network is not very good in my opinion. the connection is always cutting out or it's always having problems because i will be able to do research on my computer on campus for one minute and then the next minute the internet connection is lost. To be able to try and do school work in your own quiet place on campus is impossible to achieve. Even when you just have to resort on going into the library, all of the computers are occupied and most of them are on facebook or watching movies to waste time and take up space for those students that really need to use them for school."
College Freshman,2,"It is rather poor which is why I have decided to do most of my general education requirements online through Coastline.  Teachers need to stay on topic and not wonder off.  I know it is hard to do but they can make some progress.  However, despite all my criticism it does at least give me some education and preparation for transfering which is better than none at all!"
College Freshman,2,"Average to Poor Experience – I am Business Major and plan to transfer from Cypress and Coastline to a four year college.  I chose to do Coastline along with Cypress because I like to get a learning experience virtually as well as in the classroom.  Plus being the classroom helps with listening skills which is vital for any job.  
      Cypress deserves a C because their academic advisors aren't really much help at all.  I got the information of the IGETC and CSU requirement list from a advisor from Chapman.  Seems like they do not care about their students and just want to move on to the next student in line withou fulfilling the current student's questions and concerns.  
      As far as Academics go I could see unfair grading in every aspect imaginable.   Teacher's pets defnitely get favored treatment when it comes to mistakes on their work and exams.  I have also heard some borderline discrimination comments.  For example just because someone is Asian that does not make him or her a math expert nor does a latino last name make that person know any more than the average American when it comes to Spanish.  
        The class size is ridiculous you have people sitting on the floor hoping for a spot to get into the class.  Then you have the ones that registered first and don't even stick it out to the end of class!  It is truely horrible to see that people are willing to sit on the floor to get in the class and then half of the classmates are dropping before the I get a W date.  There needs to be action maybe the ones that can't get in can read the book and do the assignments online and only come in to take exams.  There is numerous ways to get this done with today's technology and there needs to be changes."
College Freshman,2,The Nursing program is really impacted but if you get the points needed to enter the program you are on the right track although I would prefer to transfer to a university to get into the program more easily.
College Sophomore,2,"I am a liberal studies major; I am pursuing a career in teaching. I have only taken one course in education at Cypress College. The reason being is they don't offer very much, just a few. I plan to take courses in education at the university level."
College Student,2,Honestly I am a visual learner and need an actual person I can interact with to educate me. So I have not taken any online courses are furthermore have the desire to attend an online class at all.
College Sophomore,2,I think that the way the financial aid works is rather heartless and crude. Most of it takes so much time just waiting and it seems like the system goes down often and after you have been waiting for 2 hours they tell you to leave.
College Junior,2,"The student body does not really go around talking to students, except when they are trying to get elected. After the election, I usually never see any of them."
College Freshman,2,"I had a problem with my finacial aid going through, and it took me five trips to the finicial aid office to get it all in order. Also getting money back takes an extremely long time."
Sophomore,1,"Online learning is terrible! Teachers can't get Zoom to work nor can the students. Some teachers also run class like it's a normal day and expect us to access to things we normally have access to, but we don't have that anymore since the campus is shut down."
Senior,1,The online class was the most terrible thing specially there are some class can’t be taking online they become very hard. For the professor some other handle it good other didn’t.
Niche User,1,This college is a mess. Luckily I dropped classes before the term began. I have friends still attending and it's a circus. Lab times being shut down because lab techs are never around. Classrooms are never open and if you have an issue the dean is never available..the fine arts dean to be exact. Her little minion receptionist is rude and just makes excuses. The college takes your money and doesn't fulfill the course descriptions outlined in the syllabus. The campus is nice though.
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid office is not helpful at all. I have had the person in charge demand forms that do not exist. They do not try to get you all the money you could deserve. They procrastinate, not processing applications until months after they are received. They are often rude and cannot always correctly answer questions. Plus, tuition keeps going up because of California's budget crisis."

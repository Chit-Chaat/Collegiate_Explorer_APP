Junior,5,"I love the community atmosphere at Endicott College, specifically with regards to how friendly and welcoming everyone is and how students work together to leave a lasting impact on the college campus.  Additionally, the ocean front views are beautiful and when the weather is nice it's easy to walk over to the beaches and sit with some friends.  The educational and professional experience gained through Endicott's academic courses, as well as their internship program, also makes the investment entirely worth it. I feel confident that Endicott has put me on the right path to achieving success in the future, once I have graduated."
Alum,5,"Endicott College has a beautiful campus located right by the beach. The faculty supported me throughout my years as an undergraduate and continued to do so after graduation. Endicott offers endless possibilities, I studied abroad and landed an internship abroad as well with the help of the Dean of International Affairs  and Career center. In addition, the student life was very dynamic and engaging, everyone is friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend attending Endicott College, you will not regret it."
Alum,5,I took several classes online during the summer and winter break. I rate my learning experience as excellent. The platform and the lectures were above what I had expected.
Freshman,5,Endicott has given me the chance to meet new people with a wide range of interests and I have meet some of my best friends there and learned so much from the staff.
Sophomore,5,"I like Endicott because the academic programs are amazing. The class sizes are small so you are able to build real connections with your professors. The course work is challenging but the staff and professors are always willing to help you with anything you need. Another thing I like about Endicott is the location. There are three private beaches just for Endicott students. Also, Boston is just a short train ride away. There is a lot to do on campus and everyone has a positive attitude."
Freshman,5,"I really like the nursing program, they start you off freshman year getting involved and really prepare you to go out into the field sophomore year"
Sophomore,5,A very tight-knit community with a lot to do and a beautiful atmosphere. The staff and teachers are excellent and overall the school is extremely welcoming and homey.
Sophomore,5,"Endicott College is a wonderful school that has a welcoming community and allows students to learn and grow to become contributors of society. Endicott has a wonderful group of staff members that help students grow and support them when times become difficult. Additionally, Endicott College has a wonderful internship program that allows students to network and begin their career search well before graduating from college. Endicott college requires students to complete two 120-hour internships freshman and sophomore year, and an additional full semester long internship senior year. There is also a wonderful study abroad program that allows students in most majors to be able to study abroad and gain a once in a lifetime experience. Overall, I would recommend students of all kinds to further research what Endicott College has to offer."
Freshman,5,"Endicott provides its students with numerous activities, academic programs, field of study, and a variety of opportunities where I feel as though I can excel and live up to my full potential"
Freshman,5,"This is my freshman year.  I love this school, it was a perfect fit for me.  I love the campus, the teachers are very helpful.  My dorm and roommates are great. I am playing sports and loving this."
Senior,5,I love Endicott Boston! I can not stress this enough!!! They have made my second time back to school the most rewarding experience. They have night and day school options. They took ALL of my credits and I had not been in school for years. The teachers are real professionals in their field and really have great input.
Sophomore,5,"I like the close knit community, the small classes, and the Endicott Pride that is evident in all parts of the campus."
Graduate Student,5,I loved Endicott's internship program and how they make you go into the real world to test out what kind of work you think you might be interested in. I love the professors and the small classroom sizes. The staff are willing to work closely with you to get the best learning experience and to help you improve in and outside the classroom. My favorite part about going to Endicott would be the small campus atmosphere where you see a lot of familiar faces and can get to know a lot of people on a more personal level than if you went to a big campus.
Niche User,5,I loved endicott college because of how welcoming and caring all the staff and students are to new students coming in.
Niche User,5,"Endicott has come a long way in the past few years. The campus is beautiful, right near the water and has great new construction. I hear the academics and student body have greatly improved too!"
Senior,5,Endicott offers a unique internship program which has provided me ample opportunity for job experience and hands-on education. The campus is beautiful and provides an exceptional learning environment for all students. The issue at Endicott is the amount of parking on campus. The school makes it difficult for students to park their cars because of a lack of available spaces.
Sophomore,5,"The professors are great and very helpful, the campus is beautiful, and the dorms are nice. The food is good for the most part and so are the athletics. They have a really good nursing program as well."
Freshman,5,"I only started going to Endicott in the Fall of 2017. But I can honestly say that I love this school. Not only is the campus beautiful, but the events that take place are exciting and refreshing. You never have to worry about being bottled up in your room with nothing to do. All of the events are free too, which is perfect for a college student. On top of that the people here, both students and teachers, are extremely nice and helpful. If you struggle with classes teachers are open to helping, but there is also the tutor center so you can receive help if you don't want to go to the teacher. Everything about this school is something I adore and I can't wait to get the best education available to me."
Sophomore,5,Endicott has been one of the greatest experiences if my life. I am a commuter student and thought that I would feel like an outsider.  I was completely wrong. The campus makes me feel at home and the Professors have been great. I couldn't imagine being at another school.
Sophomore,5,"I really love Endicott College because of the academic setting. The classes are small, usually about 20 students on average per class. This gives myself and my peers the opportunity to become close with the professor and have more one on one time with them if needed. It also is a reassuring to have my professors know my name instead of me just being a face to them. The campus and very friendly and there are always activities going on to keep the students busy and to help make friends."
Senior,5,"1) Small school w/ football.  Endicott provides the right balance. 
2) Close to Boston-catch the train in 20 min. area safe + lots of events.   Close to Salem for a night out. 
3) Snowboarding close by for Fun weekends w/ friends.  
4) really nice dorms.  Easy walk to class - roll out of bed + into class. 
5) Food great, plentiful + varied.  
6) Internships.  I have an awesome resume. Getting lots of Job offers.
7) challenging classes, but not so ridiculous that I’m  struggling with C’s all the time. 
8) Professors want you to succeed. 
9) A beautiful campus to die for. 
10) Smaller class sizes means hands on opportunity VS large boring lectures w/ 100s of people 
11) lots of help available for more difficult classes. 
12) awesome networking / friends - lifetime connections
13) Lots of school spirit + many planned events.  How many places do you know where the president of the college has a BBQ for all out at the waterfront mansion?  That happens a lot here."
Freshman,5,Endicott College is a great place to go to school. It has one of the most beautiful campuses I've ever seen. Endicott really tries to prepare students for the future. This school places a strong importance on internships. Everyone on campus is very friendly. The dorms are very clean and big.
Sophomore,5,"Endicott College has made a large-scale impact on my adult life. In my two years of being here thus far, I have experienced nothing but kindness, support, and a well developed education. One of Endicott's most beneficial features is its internship program. I am only a sophomore in college, and have already completed two three-week internships and several other field experiences. These internships have confirmed my passion and my decision to major in Elementary Education, as well as prepare me for the work world. Endicott does an exceptional job preparing students for their future. While I have no suggestions for the educational programs on campus, I would recommend more dining options for students. There is only one main dining hall on campus where students can use their meal swipes and three other small spots where students can buy coffee, sandwiches, and salads on Flex dollars. More diversity within the dining options would make the Endicott experience a little better, overall."
Niche User,5,"I like the atmosphere, you can't get tired of looking at it, but the size is a serious consideration and the amount of parking spaces is a a growing concern."
Freshman,5,"Endicott opens it arms to each individual, accepting all races, disability statuses, learning levels, and so much more. One of the things I looked for in a college is that they were accepting of those with disabilities since I have done and still do clubs with students and young adults with disabilities, Best Buddies for example. Additionally, Endicott has a homey feeling that is impossible to describe, but quite possible to feel and is evident when you are on the campus. It's beauty and wonderful programs make Endicott a must consider for the place to call your home for the next 4 years. Go Gulls!"
Freshman,5,"I highly recommend Endicott College to anyone looking for education in a private institution. We have a very tight-knit community where mostly everyone is friendly. Everyone is looking out for you and trying to help. Our campus is beautiful, and there's always something to do. This is a truly unique place which provides you with all the opportunities you need to succeed."
Senior,5,"Endicott offers so many unique and rewarding opportunities to its students, with the internship program and study abroad program being particularly integral in making my experience at EC so incredible. The small class sizes and beautiful campus are great, too!"
Niche User,5,"My first visit to Endicott College was on an open house tour, and it was a very pleasant experience. I thought the campus was very beautiful and well kept. I also thought all of the people I met were very welcoming and that the food services had a wide variety of choices, which is nice as I am a person with food restrictions. I also thought the dorms were very nice and bright, and didn't feel dark and old. I was also really pleased to find out that there are constantly activities going on for the students."
Junior,5,Endicott has a beautiful campus filled with wonderful people.  We are a close knit community and really helps when learning.  The internship program is unbelievable and all my summer jobs have come out of my winter internships.  The professors are great and it is really a great place to learn.
Freshman,5,"Since I'm a freshman, I don't have years of experience, but so far, Endicott has been great. I really like my classes and the faculty is very concerned with helping students be successful. The campus is beautiful. How many other colleges have their own private beaches? I'm excited about the intern programs and the study abroad options."
Niche User,5,"The college tour was wonderful.  My tour guide was very friendly, helpful, and informative.  The campus is beyond beautiful and I can see myself going there."
College Freshman,5,Great campus and everyone is extremely friendly
College Junior,5,I've had a great time at endicott. I couldn't be happier with the school that I chose.
College Junior,5,"Very safe campus. Campus police are always out patrolling, Campus is well lit, and easy to navigate."
College Sophomore,5,I love the class size and the professors are always available
College Sophomore,5,The internship program is one of the main reasons why I chose to attend Endicott. It gives students a real boost into the real world and allows for hands on experience
College Sophomore,5,This school is amazing. Overall the best professors and programs. Wouldn't want to go anywhere else.
College Sophomore,5,We have great sport teams and most teams get a good turnout.
College Sophomore,5,"love the school and the atmosphere, wouldn't want to go anywhere else."
College Junior,5,It's been great so far!
College Sophomore,5,"I LOVE ENDICOTT, EVERYONE HELPS"
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on this campus. We always have campus police driving/walking around campus. They are always visible and very friendly so if you need help they will always help you. We also have poles around campus where you can contact the campus police and they know exactly where you are and can help you.
College Freshman,5,"This college main focus is Internships, therefore they have made it a part of the curriculum. Every year you have to have a 120-hour internship. Thanks to this, we are more prepared after we graduate and it will be easier for us to get a job."
College Freshman,5,"I like the courses I have been taking so far. They are interesting and I feel like I am learning something new every day. I can thank the professors for that. So far, the professors I have had have been passionate about what they are teaching and they want us to success in everything we do. The class sizes are not more than 15-25 people which I like because then I feel closer to the teacher and they can also help a larger group of people which results in better teaching and learning."
College Freshman,5,"The campus is so beautiful. With three private beaches, leaves that changes colors and breathtaking views, this college is hard to not love att all seasons. For me as an international student, you have a lot of help if you need with studies such as tutoring centers, writing centers and teacher's office hours. The students attending Endicott are really nice and for me coming from another country it is easy to fit in and make friends. What makes me school unique is that internship is required as an course which makes is easy for me after graduating to get a job. My overall experience attending Endicott for my first year has been overwhelming. I have met so many new people and developed as a person and that only after one year, imagine what would happen the next three.

The only thing bad about my school is that it does not provide financial support to international students. Therefore, it is hard for me to afford going here and the reason I am taking this survey."
College Sophomore,5,"I live in a suite with three girls, but share a room with only one. I love being in a suite because everyone has their own space but we can still hangout together and not have to walk across campus to see each other."
College Sophomore,5,"Athletics is a big part of our school, but it is not for everyone and I understand that. The coaches and athletic trainers have changed my life for the better after a season ending injury and are helping me to get back on the field. The fans and support we have from the student body is incredible. I feel like a pro when I step on the field and have a fan section cheering the team and I on."
College Freshman,5,Campus security is great and come July they will be armed.
College Freshman,5,The internship process helps a ton!
College Freshman,5,"Sports are a huge part of Endicott College. Perhaps it is because I am an athlete that I feel like most people I meet are athletes but, to me the college feels like a large portion of the student population are athletes. I am proud to say I am an Endicott College Gull."
College Freshman,5,"I love school so far. Despite the overall adjustment of being away from home for the first time, everyone at Endicott makes the effort to make sure my academics are a priority. In addition, I am on the Men's Lacrosse team so, the immediate effect of having forty-five best friends has made my life and transition a lot easier."
College Freshman,5,"I think that the work load for every student is very manageable. I sometimes feel like the academic aspect is too easy...? But that may just be because there are a lot of elite students at the college and being around them makes it a little harder to pick out the students having a hard time. The registration process is a bit difficult for first time users, and I think that there could be a better option than randomization."
College Freshman,5,"Students are very focused on achieving their degree to get them into a career that they enjoy. The internships almost always provide students with a job right out of college, which is something unique about the school. Internships are required all four years of school, allowing students the chance to make many connections so that when they apply for a job after school they will know people in that area. I often see recruiters on campus and there are forums held for anyone interested in certain fields. I think that the career center in very helpful and there are always advisers available to help a student on the path they wish to go on."
College Freshman,5,"I genuinely feel as though every professor on this campus wants their students to succeed. They care for each student individually and they do their best to make their students the best they can be. I think the wide variety of classes offered is awesome, there are so many different courses. If a course you want to take isn't available one semester then just wait until the next one to see if you can get into it. Class sizes are perfect, around 15-25 students in each. I think that the course sign up process could be done a little bit better than randomization because a lot of students couldn't get into the classes they wanted to very easily."
College Junior,5,"It is an amazing school with an incredible internship program, challenging courses, countless opportunities and the best view ever."
College Freshman,5,Choosing Endicott College has been the best decision I have ever made. I am having so much fun making new friends and challenging my self in my academics. I can't wait to see what the future has for me.
College Freshman,5,Scholarships are the only reason I go to this school. They're very generous and will give you more money if you ask for it.
College Freshman,5,You're on a gated campus
College Freshman,5,I've gotten great professors so far
College Freshman,5,"It's very easy, you just declare it."
Sophomore,4,Endicott is a great place to be with a very welcoming community. The campus is so beautiful and the beaches are so much fun. The people definitely created a positive atmosphere.
Junior,4,"Endicott is a great nursing school. I love the professors and our clinical experiences are amazing! I live in Maine, so being away from home was hard at the beginning. However, the community and campus was so welcoming and it really made my transition into college much better than it would have been anywhere else."
Alum,4,I liked how helpful my professors at Endicott College was. I also loved the campus life and made life-long friendships!
Freshman,4,A beautiful campus with good professors that care.  A lot of people drop out because they do not realize the expense. Others transfer due to lack of party scene. Students are very nice and helpful. The housing is kind of limited but the dorms are really cool architecturally and location wise. The food it Sedexo which is common for most schools (its just not good anywhere).
Freshman,4,"Endicott is a beautiful campus and welcoming environment. The staff and professors are open to helping students with anything they need. There is a great support system available as well. They offer many resources for academic help, internships, and career paths."
Junior,4,"I had a rough start to college, thinking that I didn't belong anywhere or that it wasn't the right fit for me. However, I became an orientation leader and that helped me fall in love with the school all over again. Now, I can't imagine myself anywhere else. I found my group of people and they have contributed to my trending upward positive experience. I would like to see athletes treated the same way as the rest of the students. They are currently treated as if they are invincible and can do no wrong. I would like to see more emphasis on our other programs at my school, not just athletics."
Freshman,4,"Overall, in my first semester here at Endicott I would say that the institution truly cares about its students and their success. The atmosphere is almost like one big family, everyone is really nice and it is a fun environment to be in. It offers the small campus feel but is also very close to Boston and some really fun vacations stops meaning there is a lot to do and explore. I really like it here and am looking forward to the next three years."
Niche User,4,"Absolutely Beautiful campus in the hills.  I did my study abroad, but the main campus is great and small."
Junior,4,Teachers are great. The Dean of my major was extremely helpful.  Internship program is the perfect way to gain hands on experience in the business field.
Freshman,4,"The school has a very tight knit community and a contained campus. The diversity is highly lacking with 80% + being white but that's just how it goes. The campus feels very safe with blue lights scattered throughout. The food is okay with one of the food places staying open until 2am, but the main dining hall is mediocre unless they are trying to impress people. There are a lot of parties. The beach (3 beaches actually) is right across the street and visible from the windows of some dorms. Class sizes are small (max of 30 people unless for internship class) and most of the professors are there to help you. It is required to take 3 internships over the four years so there is a high chance of having a job when you graduate."
Junior,4,"At Endicott College, you will find that all of your professors, dean's, and other faculty will be on a first-name basis within the first week or two of knowing them. You are exposed to the beautiful ocean, state parks, and other outdoor hiking and sightseeing opportunities. At Endicott College, you are guaranteed to find your life-long friends and be in a place where you feel as if you fit in perfectly."
Freshman,4,"Great student community.  The Business Deans are extremely helpful in all aspects. Some of the professor's lack knowledge of their subject. Endicott has many connections in the Boston Area and a good amount in CT, but if you are looking anywhere else it is extremely difficult. There are many opportunities through clubs."
Senior,4,"Endicott College is a beautiful school that has great academics and a wonderful internship program. I, however, have not been a fan of the social life here on campus. I have found a large majority of the people to be judgmental and separate themselves into individual groups. I wish that this school had a better social life but besides that, I have had a great time at the school."
Sophomore,4,"Endicott is a beautiful campus with the water fountains but some students are careless and trash the campus. There are not much fun non drinking activities to doon weekends but student life does their best.  Professors are great but inconsistencies with professor attendance in my general education.  As much as some people like a day off, it putts the class behind and the professor rushes to cram as much as possible veggie the final which is a unnecessary stressor.  I understand if the professor is sick but toy tend to catch on it the professor is making excuses not to show up to class.  I'm paying a pretty penny to go to this school Ann's I feel it's a little unfair.  The largest highlight of this school is it's internships because experience before the real world tells you if you like what you do or you switch majors. It also helps get jobs out of college which other college students have trouble with."
Junior,4,"I love the environment and facilities, and I have met some of my best friends here. The biggest complaint I have is how dang expensive the school is, and the fact that they do not adequately compensate their resident assistants. Also, the mathematics department has a tendency to grade towards an average of a C - lower than the minimum GPA required in order to maintain the scholarships they grant."
Freshman,4,I loved the campus. It made me really want to be there. So beautiful. I really like talking with students and teachers.
Freshman,4,"The small community allows personal learning experience and a lot of one on one time with professors. Fostering education and having an exciting experience for students is number one on the professors list. Every week a newsletter is sent out with the plethora of activities, events, and other occasions that students can participate in or attend. Even tho it is growing exponentially in size, the community is still tight knit and close, with the campus fostering this relationship between students and faculty."
Sophomore,4,"It may not seem important, but the beautiful scenery of the campus makes Endicott really special.  Endicott doesn't feel like a college campus; it feels like a home.  Nature is all around is truly celebrated by the students and faculty, and it is crucial that college students feel comfortable in the environment in which they'll be living for four years.  Also, no other college prepares students for career experiences like Endicott. Internships are mandatory and part of the course curriculum and the internship experiences I have gained throughout my time at Endicott have not only shaped my career path but have also allowed me to learn more about myself and what I want in my future."
Freshman,4,Endicott College is a beautiful campus with beaches right across the street. There are many majors and incredible classes to take. The teachers are amazing and always willing to help their students. The internship program is great and a very helpful tool to have. Endicott College pushes students into the future and provides the assistance they need.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy being here because of the program I am in and the friends I have made through it. The weekends and night life aren't great. Dorms could be better, but definitely are better than some from other schools. Staff are all very nice, some are unorganized/ not very interested, but most enjoy their jobs and it shows. Food it pretty good most of the time, lots of options and some consistent options of you do not like the changing meals. Einsteins bagels is a life saver."
Niche User,4,I loved Endicott. It has such a beautiful campus and everyone there was just so nice. You can tell that the students are enjoying their time there. My tour guide was somewhat rude and uninformative and the school itself is less diverse than other ones that I have seen
Freshman,4,"I love how close the community is. The staff here is always trying to put on community events, such as barbecues and karaoke nights. Not many colleges do that."
Senior,4,The best aspect of Endicott College is the beautiful campus. It is located right across the street from three beaches.
College Junior,4,"I'm a finance major, and I couldn't be happier with the finance department at the Gerrish School of Business. Great professors, and great resources."
College Junior,4,The housing selection process is very flawed. It's very confusing and hard to navigate.
College Junior,4,"Its a d3 school, but sports are a huge part of the school. The atmosphere at games is more like a  D1AA atmosphere"
College Junior,4,"A very inviting atmosphere, that makes you feel right at home."
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on this campus
College Sophomore,4,The majority of the housing is very good
College Sophomore,4,"Teachers are professional and knowledgeable, no problems"
College Sophomore,4,School works very hard on helping others find jobs and internships
College Sophomore,4,"our campus is safe, if there is a problem i do not know about it"
College Sophomore,4,"over eighty percent of students live on campus, living is good"
College Sophomore,4,There are many blue lights on campus. You can always call campus safety if you feel unsafe while walking at night and they can come pick you up and give you a ride to your residence hall.
College Freshman,4,I love this school but sometimes it can be boring. You have to go out and find things to do they aren't just going to come to you. You have to go look for them.
College Freshman,4,"The class size is one of the best aspects of the academics at Endicott College. Classes are generally very interactive, engaging the students and making sure they are understanding the material."
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman I have not had many experiences with career prospects, but I am fully confident that the connections with the school and the career center will prove to be strong."
College Freshman,4,The housing options here are better than what I have seen at other colleges.  Happy to live here for each residence hall is different and unique in its own way.
College Freshman,4,School spirit is a major aspect on this campus. Students are very much involved in athletics and if they aren't playing they are attending the events.  Athletics at Endicott are strongly supported and most students are athletes.  The teams generally perform at the top of their conference.
College Freshman,4,Overall I have had a great first year experience at Endicott College. All of the professors have been knowledgeable and friendly. Residence life is a great support system.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't heard of any incidents of abuse or assault on campus, which means the students respect each other while the campus police are very good looking out for students"
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are reasonable and the teachers are very approachable with work that needs to be done. Many times I have finished projects or papers early and the teacher would help me fix what needed to be fixed in order to get a better grade.
College Freshman,4,Thus far while looking for internships many employers have brought up the fact that I go to Endicott and say that everyone that they get from there is a great worker. There are also many alums that are in high positions in companies
College Freshman,4,The athletic teams have large amounts of success at Endicott. A large part of it has to do with being a tight knit family and attending each other's games. The only down side is the size of the varsity gym is tiny and tough to get a full team in there to lift.
College Freshman,4,So far this school is a great choice for myself with the mix of athletics and schooling. Being able to go to a school with such a prolific internship program was a big reason why I picked Endicott and why I would pick it again. Along with the experience at the beaches after classes on warm days aren't a bad reason to pick Endicott either.
College Sophomore,4,MOST PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO KNOW ABOUT ENDICOTT
College Sophomore,4,SELECTING HOUSING IS NOT EASY. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH BEDS FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ACCEPT TO THE SCHOOL. AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE SO OLDER PEOPLE LIVE IN DORMS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO LIVE.
College Sophomore,4,I'M ON THE EQUESTRIAN TEAM AND THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US
Recent Alumnus,4,i loved everything about Endicott College.
Recent Alumnus,4,i never fee unsafe on campus
Recent Alumnus,4,I love the location and the education I received. Would like more helping finding future jobs
College Junior,4,"overall the campus is safe. There are various emergency locations and the campus safety officers are constantly circulating the campus. The gates are locked at night, but it would  be easy for someone to walk on campus at night that did not belong. I would like to see more outdoor surveillance cameras."
College Junior,4,"The food is horrible, For the $4,000 a year the quality is absolutely horrible. Otherwise the classes offered are diverse, but are sometimes difficult to get into if it is not specific to your major. The class size is ever growing, which is a downfall because the college is suppose to have an 18:1 ratio in class size."
College Junior,4,As a nursing major I have not found the campus to be supporting of student careers.
College Junior,4,Endicott College has provided me with amazing opportunities for my nursing career. The facility if focused on directing you towards your goals.
College Freshman,4,There are many services and people here for students to reach out to if need be.
College Freshman,4,We have great dorms here (private bathrooms etc.) but the housing selection process gets complicated.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of athletes at this school, and almost all of the students seem to be involved with the sports here, even if it is just attending the games to show support."
College Sophomore,4,Nobody is very prejudice towards anyone who has different views then they do.
College Sophomore,4,"Endicott uses alcohol just as much as any other college, maybe even less. Drugs are not very preset and I haven't encountered any peer pressure."
Junior,2,"Online nursing school was difficult and definitely not preferred. However, it was manageable and I feel that I still learned things."
Junior,2,"The nursing program is kind of a mess.  Though the professors know what they're doing and other administration is very kind, the program is always trying new things with my class. It's usually very disorganized and confusing.  For the cost of this college, I wouldn't say it's worth the money, especially with the constant damage due to parties and rich entitled students.  The only decent part is clinicals starting sophomore year."
Recent Alumnus,2,I knew several classmates who had been assaulted. I'm not sure what was done about it - but it was kept very quiet.
Recent Alumnus,2,Housing can be hit or miss. Some students live in trailers!
Recent Alumnus,2,The classes were not good enough to help me get a job - and yet - everyone got an A. Internships were the only place I learned and made connections for the job hunt. Teachers really didn't care and were never around.
College Freshman,2,"The internship program is superb, but I do not think that the degree is worth what we pay for it. This is why I am attempting to transfer."
College Sophomore,2,"The food at the Callahan is poor quality, and if you want to buy food elsewhere on campus you only have the option of the Lodge, Einstein's, or the Courtyard Cafe, all of which serve subpar coffee and extremely expensive salads and sandwiches."
College Freshman,2,Party scene is dismal at Endicott. Campo is super strict and that causes people to get trashed in their rooms before they go out. Most fun parties are incredibly exclusive and guarded by door bitches that will ask you who you know there. Even if you know someone they probably still won't let you in. A lot of people are from really close by and leave every weekend. Definitely not what I was expecting when I came to college. You might still have fun if you're fine with pre gaming a ton with like 3 people then wandering around drunk all night.
College Freshman,2,Food in the Callahan is absolutely terrible. It often isn't even safe to eat. They frequently undercook chicken and serve it completely raw. It is also run by Sodexo who are known for underpaying and mistreating their workers. They serve almost no healthy options. If you can eat mediocre pizza and pasta every day of your life then Endicott's expensive meal plans are for you! They don't let students opt out for food sensitivities and they force you to stay at 14 meals a week even if you will never eat that many.
College Junior,2,It's not necessarily a difficult process but the amount of aid they actually give out is very limited.
College Freshman,2,Only the lacrosse team does well.
College Freshman,2,Ive had some great professors and some bad. Actually Ive had all adjuncts that also work at the community colleges around the Boston area. This is only a little bit frustrating because i feel like i can be going to community college and getting the same education. This only proves that the sky high price tag for Endicott is for the campus and new buildings. Endicott is not investing in education and technology. They are investing in aesthetics and material things that do not impact your education in any way.
College Freshman,2,"As an average middle class student here at Endicott I received NOTHING for financial aid. Well I actually received a academic scholarship for 5,000 then received a mere 2,000 for financial aid. I wont lie, going to this school is a financial burden that I have now realized is not worth it. I will be looking for cheaper options for next fall."
College Freshman,2,"Not really much diversity in terms of anything here.. Everyone is pretty well off, almost everyone here is white unless on the football or basketball teams, there are a handful of international students but they are also white.. Seems like a lot of liberal people here, many liberal professors as well. Everyone seems to be a non-practicing something or another in terms of religion. Only have met one LBGT person here."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone here wears vineyard vines/Uggs/north faces/Lululemons. Very few people here who actually wear unique/fashionable clothing. Everyone judges them when they do as well. Lots of rich kids here who have never worked a day in there life, but there are some really awesome people it just takes some looking. Once you find your group though you are all set. But you will run into a handful of snobby people."
College Freshman,2,They don't give much financial aid. I applied for extra aid twice because I was in a bad hardship/unexpected situation and did not receive anything more like $500. Finally I was offered an invitation to be in the honors program ($4000/year) and applied for another loan.
College Freshman,2,"Haven't had much experience with off-campus housing, but I have tried to find some for next year and there really isn't much available. Endicott offers some off-campus housing through the school but there is still a lack."
College Sophomore,2,"The main dining hall food is pretty bad most days, and retail dining is only slightly better but extremely expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"When there are parties thrown at the Townhouses or Hawthorne, they are exclusive. Many times you will experience a stuck up girl or guy at the door saying ""who do you know here?"" If you're not attractive, you're not let in."
College Sophomore,2,Most people I've met at this school are preppy and stuck up.
College Freshman,2,Having a car as a freshman would be much easier.
College Freshman,2,"The Callahan is pretty bad, go to the Lodge"
College Freshman,2,"The wifi here sucks, plain and simple."
College Junior,2,"There is not a lot of diversity on campus. There are international students, but overall there are mostly caucasian students."
College Junior,2,"The nightlife is not very fun at Endicott. There is usually not a lot to do, and it is hard to have fun on the weekends most of the time."
College Junior,2,"There are a lot of people that drink on campus. There is a healthy living dorm that is offered to students. There are students who choose to live here, which is great, but they are still looked at in a different light than other students who choose to party. It is just a terrible situation because you should not be judged by whether or not you party on the weekends, but usually you are judged on this."
College Freshman,2,Same thing over and over again.
College Sophomore,2,"The best way to get around is if you have your own car. You can get around in other types, but it's more time-consuming and expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"Endicott has very strict regulations on partying in the dorms and alcohol, even if you're 21."
College Sophomore,2,Nursing is hard to get into regardless of the school
College Freshman,2,"This school is incredibly expensive. I got what was supposed to be the most aid that they give anyone, and it is still not really affordable as a middle class family."
College Freshman,2,"Very few options. Athletes party together, for everyone else there are just the townhouses. A lot of people pregame and end up just coming back to their dorms and sitting around."
College Freshman,2,"Mainly upper middle class white people, and not the ""classy"" kind either. Think stereotypical abercrombie/Northface types."
College Freshman,2,"Its a D3 school. A lot of people watch football, etc but we very rarely fill the stadium and its not big."
College Freshman,2,"I often feel like I am in high school classes as far as difficulty. I very rarely have those moments where you think ""wow i just learned something!"""
College Student,2,"There isn't much going on off Endicott's campus, let alone on the campus itself. The school does not do a good job of putting on events and it gets pretty empty on the weekends sometimes cause almost everyone is from mass."
College Student,2,"If you are loping for a school with a good party scene, DON'T COME HERE. There are the townhouses and that's about it if you don't play a sport. If you play a sport you're set because the teams live, eat and do everything together. Really not fun on the weekends and I often find myself bored. You can go into Boston but that gets expensive its $14 round trip just to get there and then you end up spending a ton of money in Boston itself so you really can't make the trip that frequently. Also Beverly is not a college town. It does not have much going on for college students so look farther if you're looking for a school with a fun town to hangout in."
College Student,2,You do not need a car on campus here at Endicott but you do need one off campus. There is nothing within tolerable walking distance.
College Sophomore,2,"Endicott does not give out to much financial aid, especially if your a commuter. Best bet is to look elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,"Endicott is a small school with very limited convenient parking. There is a new solar lot which is a great effort to be environmentally friendly, but it is not very near to dorm or class buildings.  "
College Sophomore,2,"Many times I have waited for the campus shuttle and it was MIA. There was no communication between the campus and the shuttle which is inconvenient and dangerous. It was quite frustrating; luckily I didn't have to be anywhere important, like a job or an appointment, but if I had I would not have made it. The shuttle does not cost anything, but is not very convenient. The night drivers are though. A smaller shuttle goes around campus at night for any girls who need a ride, even if it is to an on-campus party. This is very kind and thoughtful for Campus Safety to do. "
College Junior,2,I actually do not know anything about Greek life at Endicott.
College Sophomore,2,"Being on the coast of New England, we see the best and worst of it all. Snow storms, rain, thunder and lightning, 70 degrees in October... you name it. I personally enjoy it though, although it does get pretty cold come December-March."
College Junior,2,"The parking is limited. It is hard to find a spot in my assigned parking lot. I am not very close to my dorm. It is also strictly enforced. Sometimes I need to park in another parking lot for a short amount of time while in class, and it would be nice if I could not get a ticket for doing so. I pay a lot to attend this school, as well as a decent amount for a parking pass. I think I should be able to park where I need to as long as it's not a restricted spot, handicap spot, or fire lane."
College Sophomore,2,Endicott has absolutely no diversity.  The only reason people of different ethnicities come to Endicott is for athletics.
College Freshman,2,"Like many colleges freshmen are not allowed to have cars on campus however even upperclassmen struggle to find parking spots and often have to park far away from their destination. Tickets are given out too frequently for parking in the wrong lots, also cars are sometimes towed unnecessarily."
College Freshman,2,Parking on campus is very pricey and hard to come by.
College Freshman,2,"When your a freshman it sucks because you can't have a car, or it is very hard to get a parking pass. Some of the parking can be far and shitty spots if you are going to class. Be prepared."
College Junior,2,"Although somewhat unfair, campus strictness depends on who you are dealing with.  If you get in trouble for drinking or being at a party, how you handle the situation can play a large role in your punishment.  Most Residence Directors appreciate people who don't give the RA's or campus safety a hard time, and simply break up the party.  If it is your first offense, you often can get off with a warning.  If it is a more serious offense, like playing drinking games or having hard alcohol, you may have to call and tell your parents, which is extremely childish at a college level, or attend a Choices meeting, which deals with drug and alcohol use.  If you continue to get in trouble, you may be placed on probation, kicked off of your sports team, or even be required to leave campus every weekend and not be able to participate in extra activities."
College Junior,2,The shuttle is always late and sometimes never shows up.
College Junior,2,"There isn't enough parking on campus. Everything else is fine, except that the people that want or need their car on campus cannot because there is not enough room for them."
College Senior,2,"Some good parties, but the school is way too strict for underage s***. If you're 21, they tend to leave you alone on campus until around 130, but off campus you're left to deal with neighbors and cops."
College Senior,2,"Some good restaurants and convenient to get into Boston, but outside of Beverly Farms--where the school is located--there are a lot of massholes. Its a run down town to an extent....not many smiling faces on the streets lets just say"
College Freshman,2,"If your a freshman, don't get your hopes up. The freshman nighlife amounts to boozing and doing other ""activities"" in your dorm or on the more secluded parts of campus. Upperclassmen parties are generally only accessible to girls who meet the upperclassmen's standards of attractiveness on that given evening. Although, if you have good roommates/friends you can all pile into a dorm room and have some good college fun"
College Freshman,2,"If you've been on a campus tour and heard the way that they try to peddle the Callahan as ""good"", don't believe a word. A colleague of my dads daughter went to endicott and said the only bad thing was the food, she wasn't lying. Rarely is it good and more often than not you will find yourself at the salad bar. True they have variety, but is it variety if it's all bad? Those with weak stomachs will want to have a budget for off campus meals. And just for reference I've been to the dining halls at Keene State and UNH visiting my friends and those state dining halls put Endicotts to shame."
College Sophomore,2,Many Caucasian Students – Many people are alike at Endicott. Most people are white and have similar backgrounds. A lot of the people come from wealthy families but many people have different political beliefs.
College Sophomore,2,"It seems that there are not very many off-campus housing options due to the location of the college. It is in a beach town, which has many houses and cottages, but not many apartments that are available for students to take advantage of. However, the college offers exceptionally nice upperclassmen housing options."
College Freshman,2,Town of Beverly – The town is desolate and incredibly boring. There is little involvement between the college and the town its resides in.
College Sophomore,2,"The food in general is TERRIBLE, but the ONE dining hall is only open from 4:45 to 6:45 during the week for dinner, and 5-6:15 on weekends. Horrible food, horrible hours. The only good food on campus is from The Lodge, but the Pizza Hut in there is disgusting and all food is overpriced."
College Freshman,2,"The bathrooms at Brindle are pretty gross. However, it's because of the idiots that leave their filth everywhere. Then, the poor janitor has to clean up their mess."
Senior,1,They think they're doing such a good job during COVID and they're putting on this face to the public but it is a horrible mess. Don't let them fool you
Senior,1,"Stay away from this school.  New administration could care less about its student body.  Once enrolled parents and student should expect to have zero support from Adminstration.

We enrolled our child 3 years ago because of all the benefits of a small student body and availability of adminstration and staff with that student body,  Since President Wiley passed away this school has spiraled down hill to nothing more than a very expensive tech training school.  Faculity is miserable, administration incredibly beaurocratic.  You will get better service at a 20,000+ student university.  Finally the clique's are 2x any high school.  Student body does not social outside of each clique.

No stars is the appropriate rating fo Endicott"
Freshman,1,"Where do I begin? The food is below average, the food on weekends is a waste of time with little to no real food options, the party scene is basically nonexistent, during the winter when it snows they are completely unprepared and terrible at dealing with the conditions. The wifi constantly crashes and has weak signals. The professors are mainly average some seem under-qualified but others are solid. There is absolutely nothing to do off campus, with limited access to the beaches because of the New England weather. Constantly poor weather and below average housing. Each night consists of going back and forth between busted parties until you finally end up at the lodge with a ton of drunk college students with nothing else to do. The only things to look forward to if you enjoy real parties are opportunities to go to other friend's colleges or going home for breaks or long weekends."
Freshman,1,"Endicott College is great if you are used to a country club atmosphere.  It is a complete culture shock if you are not though.  The surrounding areas do not offer much to do and if you do not drink there is not a lot to do on the weekends.  The internship classes are basically a waste of time, the longest I have stayed in the class before the professor dismissed us was 20 minutes (out of the 50 min class).  One could find an internship on their own easier than using the school."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life at Endicott so there is nothing to say about it
College Sophomore,1,"Campus food to say the least is mediocre. The food quality is poor and unhealthy. It's the same thing over and over again and it gets old pretty quick. Don't bother coming in on the weekends especially on a Sunday. There's barely any food. During breakfast it's empty and desolate. But during lunch and dinner It's always packed in there and sometimes you can't find a table to sit. Your best bet would be to arrive right when they're open or 30 minutes before they close. The other alternatives would be the Courtyard Cafe, Einstein's Bagels, and the Lodge. But it could be a bit pricey when you use up all of your on-campus flex dollars."
College Sophomore,1,"Endicott rarely has any parties, and if there is a large party it gets broken up within the hour by campus safety, and there are significant consequences."
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing. Prides deli, Dominoes, a Sub shop and maybe one other place that delivers. Other than that you need a car to get off campus to eat."
College Freshman,1,"not many job opportunities for freshmen, who don't have cars to get off campus"
College Freshman,1,There are not enough parking spots for the cars they allow on campus.
College Freshman,1,There is not much diversity at all here at Endicott.
College Junior,1,"The weather is very cold, and rainy. It is not the best situation."
College Junior,1,"The housing situation is absolutely terrible. It is way too frustrating and aggravating to try and get what residence hall you will be happiest in. The system is so confusing, and even with multiple back up plans, you typically end up getting stuck somewhere that you don't like. There are often times when you are placed with people that you don't know. This happens every year, not just freshman year. It makes sense for this to happen freshman year, but not your junior or senior year. It is also annoying because a lot of the residence halls need to be updated. For instance, one of the halls that I lived in last year had a refrigerator in the kitchen that had rust all over it. This was really gross. The kitchen was also in the basement, which is not pleasant either."
College Freshman,1,"If you want to go anywhere you basically need to take an expensive taxi to get there. The only transportation given is the bus which is absolutely terrible or a van that you never see! If you want to get anywhere, you're better off walking."
College Sophomore,1,"No greek life, but I think we should have it."
College Freshman,1,"It is literally the exact same thing every weekend. Go to townhouses, then to the mods, then to farmhouse, the home."
College Student,1,There is no Greek life here.
College Sophomore,1,"Food is not very good at all. The times are very inconvenient as well, especially for athletes who have practice around dinner time"
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is not allowed at our school, Endicott College. However, I think that it is actually a good thing because then no one is competing with each other and there are no worries with hazing or anything like that that would have to do with pledging. On the downside to not having greek life is the parties are not as good, crazy and fun but that just means we have more time to focus on school work"
College Freshman,1,Not eligible for Financial Aid
College Junior,1,Unsure if there is even transportation available. 
College Junior,1,"The food is terrible. The dining hall is too small. I went to dinner one night, and my roommates and I could not find a table. We were not being picky. There literally was no spot for us to sit. It was awful. I was hungry, and we had to leave the dining hall and miss out on dinner."
College Freshman,1,"The Callahan is not what they make it out to be at accepted students day and what not, one of the only down falls in the school. The lodge is awesome though!"
College Junior,1,"Parking on Endicott's campus is not well orchestrated at all.  The traffic office does not monitor how many spots are available and how many permits they issue at the beginning of the year, leaving many more cars on campus than there are places to park.  They also designate permits based on where you live, but more often than not you cannot find a space in your assigned lot.  Then, if you park in a different lot that does not match your permit, they issue you a $35-$50 ticket.  After already paying $300 per year to have a car on campus, on top of our $45,000 tuition, getting parking tickets when you try to park somewhere that is at least a 5-10 minute walk from your dorm is incredibly frustrating."
College Freshman,1,"This school is typical white middle class new england student body. There is not much diversity on campus. There is only a handful of black students and a few asians. There are a few mexican students as well because of their international program. It is a small school and most people don't know about it, which may be a major reason for the lack of diversity. The school is trying to grow a bring in a broader range of students, including location, sexuality, and race."
College Freshman,1,"School sucks. Dont waste 42,000 to come to school here"
College Senior,1,"Endicott is a mainly white school; I think i've four black students in all of the classes I've taken here. There are international students, but they seem to only stick together. There are Mexican international students that are more outgoing however."
College Freshman,1,I gave it a D+ because there is some diversity that comes from the athletic teams. I came from a highschool that had less than 30 people who weren't white (out of 800) and this is pretty much the landscape of Endicott. Save for the international students that they trumpet as their ethnic diversity.
College Sophomore,1,Drugs Don't Happen – The most popular scene that happens at endicott is alcohol. Iv'e only heard of kids doing cocaine and heroine only once. These kids don't do hard core drugs. The only drugs that happen on campus really is alcohol and weed. the visibility on campus of this is virtually invisible. however in the dorms on the weekends you can see some partying animals and some  walks of shame.
College Freshman,1,Though I do not have a car from what I hear hard to find close reasonable parking for the amount paid each year.
College Freshman,1,"Bayview Hall – I am currently living in Bayview Hall. Even though bayview hall is considered to be the ""nicest"" dorm for freshman, i would not reccomend it to anyone who likes to party. ive been written up five times during the first semester for the most absurd reasons. if the RA or RDs suspect that you like to have a little fun on the weekends, your screwed. last weekend i was written up because me and 4 of my friends were playing beer pong in my dorm. my door to my room was shut and the music was on a very low volume.however, The RA claimed that he could ""hear drinking games being played"" from the hall and wrote everyone up that was in my room. Ive never heard of a college where RA's are listening outside doors for the ""sounds of drinking games"". I was under the impression that i was going to a college not a high school. The RA's at bayview look for trouble and love writing kids up."
College Freshman,1,"Even though the school is constantly attempting to bring in more international students, most people in Endicott are white. As an international student, it doesn't really matter since everybody has been more than accepting of my nationality/customs."
College Freshman,1,"Time Warp – I live in one of the older buildings that look like high schools from the 60s.  Too hot in the winter as that you cannot control the heat; must sleep with windows open; otherwise, it's a sweat-pit.  At least the roof don't leek."
College Freshman,1,"Winter Sucks – Cold, cold, cold -especially being close to the water."
College Freshman,1,"Van Shuttle – Okay for getting around, but otherwise if yu want to go to ""big city"" Beverly, prepare for lots of dorm time."
College Freshman,1,"No Car – I don't have a car, but friends who do are constantly getting parking tickets"
College Freshman,1,Not too much diversity. A lot of people are of the same dynamic. Can make it hard to fit in if you don't fit the mold. Mostly white.
College Freshman,1,Old School – The camputer labs at Endicott College are very small and outdated.
College Freshman,1,"No Fun Here – The RA's here at super strict. Campus police is always on the lookout, and partys don't have a chance to get going."

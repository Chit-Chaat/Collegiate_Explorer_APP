Freshman,5,"I love going to a wonderful school, and the fact that my classes are both online and some in person at this time.  I also love meeting new friends from all over the country who've chosen Clemson for their education."
Graduate Student,5,"Even though I have graduated, my wife is studying in Clemson now. I feel the online study is going good, professors are taking use of various technology to establish the courses and communications. It is easy to follow and organize everything."
Graduate Student,5,"I was involved into the Master of Architecture program. It was great to study architecture in Clemson. The courses provides enhance my knowledge from both of practice and theory perspectives. You can also choose different directions based on your interests, such as CommunityBUILD, Healthcare, Digital Design, Integrated Design, etc.

Besides, It is easy to gain the practical experience due to the Career Fair (maybe 100 firms attend each year) and mentorship program in Charlestion campus. It help me find a job easily after graduation."
Sophomore,5,"Clemson is a beautiful place! It has the best people, school, and sports. They are always willing to help students regarding any situation. Attending Clemson University was one of the best choices!"
Sophomore,5,"I took my spring semester online and it went very smoothly! Of course, I did come pas complications but they were very helpful."
Niche User,5,Online learning at Clemson has not been mandated because people are doing their parts in the pandemic by wearing masks.
Niche User,5,I personally have two relatives that graduated from Clemson University and they ended up finding a good job after school
Freshman,5,"While online courses are not always preferred, Clemson University's online courses were spectacular. The professors made it almost like an in-person class and I even learned what my best study habits are."
Freshman,5,"Clemson University is a school where you have nothing but opportunities. From the start, they offer you all the academic help you can get. They also have all the majors you could ask for and plenty of electives that cover every interest and hobby. A great athletic school with great student life. 10/10 college"
Junior,5,Enrolling back into Clemson was an easy process and it was apparent that the staff and faculty truly care about their students.
Junior,5,So far my online learning experience at Clemson has been so easy and accessible. My professors are making my courses so easy to manage and they are available for any questions or concerns that I have had.
Alum,5,"overall, I loved Clemson. The town and environment were exactly what I was looking for leaving high school. Its the perfect mix of a small town and the excitement of a populated college. I wouldn't change a moment of my four years here."
Senior,5,"I love it here at Clemson, it's like one big family and friendly community. The professors and the courses can be challenging, but we are provided all resources and office hours necessary to help us all succeed, that is what I love about Clemson. Besides the academics, the leisures, amenities, and the get-togethers including football provided on campus, gives us all an opportunity to come together after days and weeks of studying to socialize and meet new people all around campus! Not only is the campus beautifully well-kept, but there are always positive vibes going around with plenty of places to sit down, study, and relax at like the Bowman field, amphitheater, and the President's park. It's hard to believe that this upcoming year is my last year here and I honestly am not ready to leave."
Senior,5,"I have taken a few courses online at Clemson throughout my semesters there, as well as recently this summer. I would have to say the courses are very well planned out. The professors are always available for any questions or help we may need throughout the course through emails, phone calls, or zoom meetings; some professors may even have office hours for you to come by in person. The courses i've taken at Clemson online have all been well organized and easy to maneuver on our own with little help. The professors will assign assignments and exams and post them on the Canvas calendar, as well as send out constant reminders as to what and when each assignment is due. The only thing I would suggest improving for some of the online courses would be holding a zoom meeting once a week to discuss as a class about what to expect each week and a summary of the lectures to focus on. Sometimes I find the pre-recorded lectures can be time-consuming and lost of interest."
Junior,5,"Clemson University quickly became my home away from home the minute I started my Freshman year. Becoming a member of the Clemson Family is something that has forever changed my life for the better. Being a Clemson student has taught me how to be a leader, how to be strong, and how to be confident both in my abilities in the classroom and outside! I believe Clemson is an outstanding school with amazing students!"
Sophomore,5,I love the sheer amount of school spirit that is prominent all around our beautiful campus. It's great to see everyone on their own path to success with great professors who are passionate about what they teach.

Senior,5,"I’ve always been told that college will be the hardest, yet best years of your life. This statement has held nothing but true for my years here at Clemson. I truly have been blessed through every experience and every person I have met, including professors, counselors, doctors, coaches and students. I have learned more about myself and life in the past three years than I ever have. I would not change a single thing about my experience as it has led me to where I am now, loving my life and looking forward to my senior year."
Senior,5,"My learning at Clemson experience is one that all students wish to have! I have had the most supportive, understanding professors who are constantly pushing me to better myself and learn beyond my limits."
Sophomore,5,The online transition due to the COVID  virus was smooth and straightforward. The teachers and staff were great at teaching and working with students. The classes were well-paced and allowed for students to access all materials when needed and were available with a multitude of tutoring sessions.
Sophomore,5,"Clemson captivated my heart the first time I walked on campus. The campus is spread out and has plenty of spaces for studying, playing catch with friends, and playing in the snow on the occasional snow day. The students and staff are always helpful and respectful. When looking for a college, I found Clemson excelled in both academics and is ranked 1st in student satisfaction. Since attending Clemson, all my academic needs have been met, and I have enjoyed every second in my two years there."
Junior,5,The professors are very willing to work with you and are more than willing to work with your schedule.
Junior,5,"Work hard, play hard is one of many mottos here. You will get a great education and have so many opportunities for involvement. You will also have the best time of your life partying and going to sporting events!"
Junior,5,Online learning is not difficult but Clemson offers courses both online and in person whatever you’re looking for.

Freshman,5,"Clemson is like a home away from home. very nice faculty and staff, game days will also probably be the best time of your life. There are also lots of activities you can partake in which makes it very hard for you to be bored"
Sophomore,5,Overall a very cool campus and very easy to get around to classes. Everyone is dressed in orange and the whole town is orange and lined with tiger paws in the street
Sophomore,5,Town is devoted to every sporting team and it is a really cool environment. This is definitely a place to call home for the next four years and meet people who come from all over. Game days are awesome and it’s like no other place in the country on Saturday
Senior,5,Clemson overs a variety of experiences through their education program and the organizations they off to each student. The campus is also beautiful and has the most amazing sunsets.
Sophomore,5,"The best college in a more remote area of South Carolina, but it is beautiful and tight knit! I would highly recommend at least visiting Clemson when you are thinking about colleges because the campus and the people here are amazing!!"
Graduate Student,5,I have had great experiences with my instructors at Clemson and have enjoyed the student and instructor dynamic of the community of learners at Clemson University.
Graduate Student,5,Clemson university has provided a major that is aligned with my plans for advancing my career. The instructors are well-versed in their disciplines and supportive of students along the way.
Sophomore,5,"with covid, classes had to be managed online but the professors were really understanding and helped to make the switch rly smooth."
Sophomore,5,"love the people, the campus, and the academics. its a school centered around tradition and rly feels like home. (plus the ice cream is to die for)."
Sophomore,5,Clemson University is a safe and comforting environment that allows its students to live and learn in safety. The thing I liked the most about Clemson University was its school spirit. I loved seeing all of the students come together and share an amazing experience with each other. The community is very close to each other. I couldn't think of one thing that I would change about Clemson University. It is the most perfect school in my eyes.
Sophomore,5,"Great school. I'm an engineering major. It's a tight-knit group of people. Overall the teachers care about their students and are willing to help them succeed. There are tons of study groups, tutors, and opportunities for help. Football games are a blast. It's an amazing nation to be a part of."
Niche User,5,"It was good, the campus was nice and their academicas are amazing. I highly recomend this university to anyone who has true intersts in school. I wouldnt vhange anything about the school. It is perfect"
Freshman,5,I love how friendly the students and staff are at Clemson University! It would be nice to see more minorities on campus.
Sophomore,5,"I have had a wonderful experience at Clemson University. While walking around campus, going into local restaurants and businesses and attending class, I can truly feel that everyone is looking out for each other. The entire town is focused around Clemson and everyone living and working in the area are diehard fans. There is great sense of  school spirit shown by the students. Attending a Clemson University athletic event is an experience I cannot even put into words. My experience in the classroom has also been very positive. Even though some of my freshman, introductory lectures were very large, the professors still cared about their students. I would go to my chemistry teachers office hours every week and I believe he is the reason that I earned such a high grade in chemistry. He never just gave me the answer, he always made me talk it out and use my knowledge to solve the problem which I believe will help me out in the long run."
Junior,5,Great professors in the Civil Engineering department. They really want to help you succeed and grow as a student.
Niche User,5,"Clemson is the place to be!! When I was younger, my family would drive through town. Everything was amazing. Now I am off in high school. I am happy to say they do have a nursing program for me. I really look forward to filling out my college application!!!"
Sophomore,5,Clemson provides great education and has a great atmosphere. Everyone at Clemson is so friendly and welcoming. There are plenty of clubs and opportunities to get involved on campus and make new friends.
Freshman,5,"Love Clemson. Great atmosphere and sense of community overall. Academics are the right amount of challenging, and they offer a wide variety of majors."
Freshman,5,Clemson has a fun and supportive atmosphere. The professors are always willing to help and the school is constantly looking for new ways to keep their students comfortable while they study. They offer ton of options for food and even will have you speak with a dietary consultant if you so need it. They are always welcoming and the campus just feels like home. They also strive to give their students access to watch sports games and attend for a lower prices. The school is so concerned for their students that it honestly makes you feel so good. It is a very good university to attend if you are looking for a comfy place to study and make friends. They have living learning communities which help everyone stay on track with studies and have access to help if needed. It is very much home.
Alum,5,"Beautiful campus, strong sense of community in public and student areas; academics are also strong, and football program is now nationally ranked and has earned 2 championships in the last 5 years."
Freshman,5,"In just 7 months at Clemson (cut short by the pandemic sadly), this school became my absolute favorite place on earth and I'm counting down the days to go back.
The energy/atmosphere there is unmatched. There really is a sense of family and connection among the student body. Multiple people came to visit me this year and left wishing they had chosen Clemson, as the positivity and ""good vibes"", the amazing people, as well as the ""perfect"" campus, made all of them feel at home.
I'm from New York, and I can tell any out-of-state students to not worry about meeting people from different, there are tons of Northerners especially.
It's so easy to find people of all interests, academic motivation levels, and lifestyles. My advice would be to always keep an open mind and embrace and appreciate every day you are there. If you go to Clemson, there's a good chance you will have the time of your life"
Freshman,5,"I love Clemson. The environment is so welcoming and happy. The campus is absolutely gorgeous and makes for great activities with friends. Nothing beats going to a Clemson football game and spending this unique time with friends! You will definitely come out of this school with tons of friends, memories and really great experiences."

I love the campus and everything inside it. I am excited to take classes at Clemson and see what else it has to offer. I cannot wait to attend the many sporting events offered and enjoy everything at Clemson."
Alum,5,"As a third-generation legacy, Clemson surpassed all my expectations. The professors genuinely care about their students, the courses are interesting, and there are so many ways to get involved."
Freshman,5,I liked the friendliness of the staff and faculty there. It felt like a family there. Good variety of classes and great professors. Go Tigers!
Niche User,5,I visited the campus and learned much about it. Everything was great and very exciting! Would like to go again.
Alum,5,"I automatically felt like I found a home. The atmosphere is like no other and I knew that when I first stepped on campus my junior year of high school. There really is something in those hills. I lived with some incredible people my freshman year that I can still call my best friends today, post-grad. If I could go back and change anything, I would only go back and participate in intramural sports. I also always felt safe on campus, even when walking alone at night from the library. I'm so fortunate to have been there during some of the best football years Clemson has seen, appearing in the CFP 4 times and winning 2 National Championships. Football weekends will forever be among my fondest memories while I was a student."
Niche User,5,The campus is very beautiful and the surrounding area provides many fun activities to do in the down time.
Freshman,5,"I am absolutely in love with Clemson and love being a Clemson student. The classes are really challenging but in a way to really help you learn and further your education. Also, lots of stuff to do on campus sports wise on the weekends!"

Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore at Clemson University and have had a great experience so far. The academics are outstanding and I am challenged everyday by the professors. They also offer amazing abroad opportunities, for nurses too! The football games are a highlight to my experience here and make the Fall semester the best part of the year."
Niche User,5,The campus life was beautiful. So many people are active and involved in many curricular activities. I wish there was more encouraging professors and educators but they are overall good.
Niche User,5,"I absolutely loved Clemson when I toured campus this past summer! It was a school that welcomed me with open arms and I felt most at home there. I love the people, the town, and the environment. I especially love all of the resources and opportunities for me to grow in my education and the supportive atmosphere there. I can't wait to get involved in so many activities like Greek life, service organizations, study abroad, undergraduate research and so much more. Go Tigers!!!"
Freshman,4,"My online experience is a lot more difficult than my high school experience.  The classes in person are an hour or so; however, online work is more like 3-5 hours for one in person class.  It's valuable to have the option of online education during the pandemic but I'd much rather learn in person."
Sophomore,4,"Great campus and education. That being said, they are not fond of releasing information to the student body about their plans each year."
Junior,4,"Overall, Clemson is a good University. There are many programs and academic tracts to take. The campus is beautiful and very walkable."
Junior,4,"When classes went online, my professors were very helpful and did their absolute best to make sure that we were getting the best education they could give us. It was frustrating to be online because that is not how I learn, personally, but my professors did a really good job doing all they could."
Junior,4,"Professors have customized the online resources such that they will imitate in-class discussions with discussion board posts, as well as in-class questions with a chat/participation feature during online lectures. The professors have adapted quickly to online teaching, allowing the students to excel as a result!"
Freshman,4,"Everything is good, except for stressing over the tuition price and catching on scholarship money to catch up to it."
Freshman,4,"Everything is good, except for stressing over the tuition price and catching on scholarship money to catch up to it."
Sophomore,4,"It has been a little difficult not having a teacher there, or to no longer have study groups. I know professors are not always checking emails, so when there is a question I can not get an answer right away like I could in the classroom. It was a little difficult to learn as well. Posting videos was confusing for me, and I felt like I did not learn much."
Niche User,4,Clemson University is a very open and nice school. They help to make everyone feel appreciated and welcome.
Niche User,4,"During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the professors were extremely understanding and helpful teaching online classes. It was a little difficult but the professors helped to make it enjoyable."
Junior,4,I love how beautiful the campus is and that there is history in the halls. Clemson has its pride so almost every student can tell you where to go and why a building is there. I would love to see more diversity.
Alum,4,I had one online class and it was difficult without a lot of in classroom discussion. If I had more experience with online classes I would have more information to offer.
Sophomore,4,"I love Clemson and am so lucky to have found the perfect college for me. I will be eternally grateful for the kindness, lessons and memories I gained from going here, and hope that you will join me as one of the thousands of Clemson alumni around the globe."
Sophomore,4,"The transition to online classes made every college student around the country uneasy. However, Clemson professors took this challenge in stride and were able to rise to the occasion and successfully finish the semester strong with their students."
Freshman,4,"some may prefer online Classes, I'm not really an online type of guy but either way the online classes are flexible and easy to go through. The professors do a good job communicating through them"
Alum,4,"I only took a few classes online with Clemson until Covid19 happened. Overall, it was fine. I prefer in-person lectures but enjoyed the flexibility that online classes offered."
Alum,4,"I committed to Clemson without ever stepping on campus. While most people consider that ballsy, I trusted my gut and it proved me right. Clemson talks a lot about ""family"" and leaving a small town to go to school 500 miles away - I needed that. Not only did it hold up its end - it allowed me to constantly test myself and grow from all my experiences. Clemson will forever have a special place in my heart and is the perfect spot for someone looking for a big college having a small college feel."
Sophomore,4,Although I did not get to finish out my first year of college it was still unforgettable! It is a beautiful campus and if you visit they talk about the Clemson Family which is true. The people around you become a family and I love my school!!
Freshman,4,"I didn’t take any classes online this year,  but I have heard really great things from friends who did."
Freshman,4,"Clemson is a great university! It is beautiful, fun, and full of life! The academics are interesting and challenging, and the professors do care about their students. My one complaint is the overall lack of accessibility. As a student with a chronic pain condition that makes walking difficult, Clemson is hard to navigate at times because it is very hilly, and doesn’t provide a lot of accommodations to the landscape. But besides that, it’s such a wonderful place! I truly love it!"
Freshman,4,The atmosphere is welcoming and engaging. All the students are so nice and really care about their academics. Walking around campus is lovely as it is a beautiful campus. Most of the professors will help you and want to see you succeed. The football is also unbeatable!
Sophomore,4,Clemson is an amazing school with teachers that truly know what they are doing. My only wish is that the application process and financial aid process were less confusing.
Freshman,4,Since becoming a student at Clemson University I have met a pleather of people who are genuinely nice and very helpful. Clemson has this type of energy on campus where you just can't help but to smile when walking through campus. One thing I would like Clemson to work on is the diversity of the students that attend the University.
Alum,4,Clemson provided me with an overall good experience. Some of my courses were challenging but interesting and the university provides several resources to help students succeed. My favorite part of Clemson was attending the football games and the overall Game Day atmosphere. Clemson could work on including more diversity onto it's campus but for the most part it was a pretty enriching experience and I would recommend it to other students.
Senior,4,"Clemson is a really special place and has lots of opportunities for students to get involved. It does seem at times that Clemson is overly concerned with money, as can be seen with the aggressiveness of parking services. However, this school is somewhere that feels like home after your four years. I wouldn't trade my Clemson experience for anything!"
Freshman,4,I love Clemson because of the family atmosphere and support at every corner. The academics are tough but there are plenty programs to help with tutoring. The accepting mature at Clemson ensures that no one feels marginalized or stepped on and it encourages success inside and outside of the classroom. The only complaint I have is in relation to on campus housing and food. The housing and meal plans are overpriced and pushed on students before they are aware of the options around them.
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere of this school! It's very homey, the professors really want to see you do well, and the campus is beautiful. I've had mostly positive experiences with people, besides the racial microaggressions(I'm a black female in STEM go figure). The dining halls are probably my least favorite part. They close at 9 during the week and 8 on fridays. Only 1 is open on the weekends. On top of that the food isn't really good. But Clemson makes up for it in other ways so I let it slide. I also like that workout classes are free! I go to a lot every week such as zumba, barre, and HIIT."
Freshman,4,"I love being a student at Clemson University. The campus is beautiful; it has a small-town feel, but don't worry it's not claustrophobic at all. There are trees all over campus and the aggressive squirrels always make me smile. The core classes I have taken do have a lot of students, so there is not very much face time with the professors(depending on who you have)."
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere at this school is amazing. It is like having a second home, where you walk in and feel welcome. The only complaint is that some professors are hired for research and do not care about teaching, so the students suffer."
Junior,4,"I would like more support for liberal arts majors and people other than the football team, but the overall vibe is good, and the professors are qualified."
Sophomore,4,"I like the atmosphere and academics. It is a tough program for science majors, but it is worth it. The library is nice and other students are generally nice."
Freshman,4,I like the overall feel of the university. When you are here you feel like you are at home. Another great aspect of the university is the teachers. Most of them have great office hours and are willing to help you whether that be going over your test or anything else. Clemson University sets you up for success.
Junior,4,"I love the campus. I don't like the food, and most activities revolve around greek life and football."
Freshman,4,The professors are all very interested in helping you learn and get your degree and the atmosphere is very friendly.
Sophomore,4,"Clemson is a beautiful university with a very great sense of community. At Clemson it really does feel like you have found a family. Clemson always has a ton of ways to get active in the community, there are always little events going on all around campus and tons of clubs to join to help make friends. Theres never an excuse to be sitting in your dorm doing nothing, the university provides plenty of entertainment thats not football related haha."
Junior,4,"Clemson is a good school academically in the State. However, it needs to better serve the needs of minorities and women on campus."
Sophomore,4,Clemson's campus is beautiful and the atmosphere here is so great. Everyone is friendly and respectful.
Niche User,4,It is a really cool school!  I would really suggest Clemson to anyone who thinks about going there.   It is expensive but it is totally worth it!
Niche User,4,Clemson is very open-hearted shows much diligence and hard work towards all students on and off-campus. Clemson is a much stable environment which it also compared similarly to Clark Atlanta University.
Junior,4,"I enjoy the campus and have had amazing professors so far. They helped me when I was looking to change my major and I am incredibly happy in my new major. I also enjoy working on the newspaper, although I would love if the student media had more funding."
Freshman,4,"My teachers are very good and there are a lot of resources to help you succeed here; however, the culture can be very overwhelming at times."
Junior,4,"My first semester at Clemson University has been so great! I have really enjoyed the classes and the people are extremely friendly. It is sometimes hard to get around campus, but you can either take the bus, walk, or bike pretty much anywhere. Of course, football is a big deal so the games are extremely fun and its always great to get into the school spirit throughout the week. My advisor has been really helpful and there's so many resources like tutoring, career workshops and organizational clubs to help you be as successful as you can be.I love Clemson so much!"
Junior,4,"The facilities, especially in the newer buildings, is on-par or better than some ivy league schools that I've toured. The school has a strong engineering/applied research base, and a good showing of basic research, too. The campus itself is beautiful, for the most part. And the weather is nice."
Junior,4,"Clemson is a great school! I am a Wildlife and Fisheries Biology major, and the program is incredible. The professors actually care about their students and take time to help you succeed!"
Freshman,4,I love Clemson! The only thing that I would change is that it is really expensive and the financial aid office does not help very much!
Alum,4,it was very nice and engaging tour. great football games and other sports. great amenities for students
Junior,4,"Clemson is a school that will challenge you academically and will help you develop a new state of mind. You will accomplish more than what you expect from yourself because of the high standards they hold you to. The only thing that they need are some mist fans around campus, because there is no escape from the heat."
Junior,4,I love the small feel of the university and the faculty are very helpful when a student needs extra help in understanding a certain part of the material.
Alum,4,My education was very rewarding and allowed me to further my career in my field. The classes were very interesting and the professors were very accommodating and friendly. The financial aid department was very willing to answer any questions I had and helped me navigate through my options. Clemson was definitely the best choice for me.
Senior,4,"Clemson has a family atmosphere that makes the transition from high school easy. The campus is beautiful and the professors are generally really caring. Local CatBus makes getting to and from campus really easy. The library has lots of study space, and I always feel safe on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Transfer was easy. If living off campus, local catbus is useful. Library has quiet levels which is nice."
Sophomore,4,"It's a lovely university! You'll instantly feel at home at Clemson, there's so many wonderful people all around for you to meet! The classes are engaging, the on-campus food is delicious, and of course the athletics here are absolutely amazing!"
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the overall atmosphere at Clemson University. The community is generally very kind and helpful. The campus is secluded from the rest of town, which makes the large university feel more intimate. I would like to see some practical elements of the college change, such as the limited parking situation."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Clemson University has been a valuable one. I am constantly challenged by my classes while learning so much at the same time. While the student body lacks diversity, the students of Clemson are vey involved. Clemson provides its students with countless resources which is an important feature in a University. Finally, the education and degree that I am working towards is unmatched."
Freshman,4,"Clemson University offers a great college experience with free tutoring centers, on-campus activities, various eateries on and off campus, and a close-knit family environment. All classes are 5-15 minutes apart and the professors really care about their students academic success. With a Clemson degree, I believe I'll be ready for the career I picked as well as the real world."
Junior,4,The value of a Clemson degree is really on the rise. There is no better time to be a Tiger. I just wish there were more inclusive initiatives for all underrepresented groups.
Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed the openness of Clemson and how kind the people are. As a transfer student I was terrified and felt that I'd just be that odd kid, but the professors and student body have made me feel safe and welcome and have pushed me to succeed"
Junior,4,"I liked all the different experiences I was able to receive from here. The academics pushed me to be a better student. They say ""There's something in these hills"" and that thing is the feeling of being in a"
Alum,4,Clemson University was a convenient place to go to school since it was close to home! The teachers seem to care about their students success and the Michelin Career center was often a helpful resource.
Sophomore,4,"Clemson University has many great programs, is research oriented, has a wonderful atmosphere, and many opportunities for academic and personal success. However, the school could be more inclusive and focus more on student feedback, especially at the lower levels of the individual colleges and major coordinators."
Junior,2,It's new so not many classes ar understood online. A lot of professors do not understand the system used for classes in general so turning it online made everything harder.
Senior,2,"I took many classes online during COVID-19. I would say that the university did its best to provide for the students, however, it really depended on the teachers and how they utilized zoom and their class schedule. Many teachers did not account for the time difference, and if they did, they did not really care."
Sophomore,2,"Clemson is extremely hit or miss. Unfortunately, I was a miss. The student body is entirely southern, which is something that's unavoidable. That doesn't mean if you're from anywhere else you can't enjoy it, but I didn't. Academically, there are a lot of great helpful resources to assist your learning. The professors, however, are a whole different story. I have only spent one year at Clemson, so I've only had about 10 professors, but I could only really rely on MAYBE 2 of them for help. Most of the professors do not want to help their students. Contrastingly, the advising staff is excellent. As for the party scene: it's terrible. I did not have fun at a single frat party, and as a freshman my standards were remarkably low. The only fun you'll have is at football games. That is genuinely the only thing Clemson has going for it- and it's not worth 40k in tuition (tickets not included, obviously)."
Freshman,2,"It's not an arts school, so I didn't really expect much from it honestly. I love the gardens and some of the people I've met here, but otherwise it feels like the track I'd like to be on is secondary to the football team."
Sophomore,2,"Im currently a sophomore at Clemson and am trying to transfer. This school doesn't live up to the hype at all. The football team is excellent but the atmosphere isn't that great because students leave at halftime for almost every game and often show up late to the start. Academics are incredible boring as most of your classes will be with 40+ students usually in a lecture hall. As for the social life if you aren't in a fraternity or sorority you won't have one. I wish I had decided to go to USC or Wofford instead, but made a stupid decision. As for the facilities the 3 dining halls on campus are awful and serve the same food every day. There is also almost no diversity here and racism is strong. The downtown is more of a street than an actual town and besides the university there is nothing. The dorms are also awful, but a good point is that Clemson is a very safe area."
Sophomore,2,"If you have a food allergy, don’t attend Clemson University. After 20 years, I was hospitalized for the first time due to improper labelling of food in the dining hall and almost died. For months the staff at Clemson has been attempting to isolate me and I was told today that my only option was to withdraw from my meal plan. There is one dining hall section that is ""allergy free"" but it is located far away and there is rarely food there. Clemson has and will continue to isolate students from their friends."
Freshman,2,"I was extremely disappointed by Clemson. The school focus is extremely centered on football, the dorms are atrocious, the food is mediocre at best, and the area around the campus is extremely boring. I expected so much more because of all the hype Clemson gets, but really I don't think it's worth it. I've hated being here since I got here."
Niche User,2,"They are very focused on their engineering students, greek life, and their football program. I felt forgotten as an education major, and lost in the sea of students in my classes."
Sophomore,2,"I'm only giving it two stars because I had some really wonderful classes. The English professors are fantastic. But there's nothing to do in town and campus life is constantly overrun by Christian fundies advertising themselves and their organizations, including a loud street preacher called Brother Micah whom the administration allows on campus every single year. (His specialty is seeing how many groups he can come up with who are going to burn in hell, and how many people in the area he can call deviant rapists.) It's hard to exist here as someone who doesn't fit the mold of a heterosexual, conservative Christian, and you need to be ready to be excluded, called names, and outright abused by people who disagree with you."
College Junior,2,"It needs to be reformed, but Clemson has ben working on it."
College Sophomore,2,You have to be very homogeneous to fit in here.
College Sophomore,2,Engineers get good accommodations. Guys in John stone are out of luck.
College Sophomore,2,"The words I have heard most often here are NO and you CAN'T. This school is a machine and actively looks to disrupt Greek Life, just wants to profit, and cares little for their freshmen. I wouldn't choose Clemson again, I urge any reading this, do not be convinced by family and friends that it is amazing. It probably was back in the 90s and 80s but its new administration has made alot of changes alumni are unfamiliar with. My mom was on the Parent Advisory Council and was also very discouraged with one of their statements, ""Students are not our customers"". And we are who they are providing the service too yet they have the audacity to believe that our experience and feedback is unimportant. This all concerns the Business College not Engineering though just to be clear."
College Junior,2,Diversity is a big issue that Clemson has had to deal with in recent years.
College Sophomore,2,My school is not how i pictured it to be. it isn't as much as a family as it was portrayed to be and the cost on top of the culture just is not what I thought it would be.
College Freshman,2,"Not much diversity, this past school year faced many issues concerning racism against blacks"
College Freshman,2,Im from the north and would need a higher degree to get a job.
College Freshman,2,Most people do not live on campus. There is not party life on campus. You are far from everythin g
College Sophomore,2,"Either I or my friends have been victims of sexual assault, rape, or sexual harassment on several occasions."
College Sophomore,2,"It's very exclusive from students not participating in Greek life, and it seems as if they only really care about their individual organization and less about doing good for the community and being inclusive of other organizations, etc."
Recent Alumnus,2,Greek life in the south is too cliquey.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't hold a high opinion of the school overall. 

This campus is often called ""beautiful."" Between all the construction and ugly looking vegetation, I don't see it. Some of the buildings are up-to-date and are quite nice. Others predate the existence of my grandparents and look out of place, the three main offenders being the Tillman clock tower, Hardin Hall and Johnstone Hall. The former two were part of the original campus and their architecture reflects this. They aren't ugly, but their age is showing. Johnstone is woefully outdated and simply should have been demolished along with its other sections. The same can apply to Clemson House, but to a lesser extent minus demolition. The only thing the freshmen dorms really have going for them are their convenience, which is obligatory. Housing for upperclassmen is there, but it largely is on the outskirts of campus.

The meal plans offered are quite expensive and are mandatory if you are a freshman. Otherwise, you don't have to have one, and I'd advise you don't buy one. The dining halls serve what I would describe as ""upgraded K-12 slop, but with lazily-thought out ethnic twists."" The only benefit are the PawPoints, which allow you to buy food from the various vendors on campus and only on campus.

Courses at this school are as difficult as you make them, with only a few being notoriously difficult (Calc II and Stats & Dynamics come to mind). If you need help, instructors have office hours set aside to assist you. Moderately challenging courses also have Supplemental Instruction, or SI. SI leaders are students who have taken a relevant course and passed with an A. Like instructors, they have periods of time in which they will help you, typically 80 minutes twice a week. The Academic Success Center offers free tutoring. Need of these resources will vary with the difficulty of the course, the instructor you have, and the student (though be warned that the math department as a whole is abysmal).

TBC..."
College Sophomore,2,"Diversity isn't all that great here. Its in the country in south carolina so you can't really expect much! If your a minority you won't be treated the same as a white person here. Unless of course your a student athlete. Student athletes are treated like royalty no matter what race, religion, ethnic background etc."
College Sophomore,2,"Housing on campus isn't the best. The rooms tend to be kind of dirty. The loft beds are hard to loft sometimes and the rooms are small. Lots of fixtures and other things are broken in the rooms or apartments. Services are good about coming out to fix things when you call though. The social atmosphere is also great. The cost for housing is also over priced and parking for Clemson students who live on campus isn't close to the housing, usually having to walk to a car that's probably 10-15 minute walk. But location on campus to classrooms is better than off campus housing."
College Sophomore,2,The Greeks are very stuck up and they only hang out with one another
College Junior,2,There are way too many girls in sororities.
Recent Alumnus,2,"For health conscious eaters/ those who have restricted diets, the dining halls don't work that much in your favor to give you a variety of options.  You have the choice of cereal, yogurt bar, sandwiches, and omlettes. That's about it."
College Freshman,2,There are not that many available options for financial aid for out-of- state students. Many of the students are in debt.
College Freshman,2,"With the palmetto scholarships, in state students really don't need to be considered for Clemson scholarships. Because of my out of state residency and status, I didn't get any money from the university. Also, take into consideration the size of HS a student is coming from for class rank, and the type of courses they take for $$$"
College Freshman,2,stick with the basics. don't get crazy
College Freshman,2,I'm constantly in fear of not having enough money/aid to pay for college.
College Freshman,2,"Punishment rarely occurs, even when there is blatant evidence of contraband."
College Sophomore,2,They need more options especially for upperclassmen
College Sophomore,2,It's not a major city so the nightlife is meh
College Freshman,2,To me it doesn't seem like any financial help is given unless you apply to meet a financial adviser weeks in advance. And even then there's no guarantee you'll even gain anything from the meeting.
College Sophomore,2,The best dining options on campus are those that are not affiliated with the school. The dining halls food is not enjoyable and there isn't a great variety day to day. They tend to have the same stuff over and over again with the exception of one or two stations per day.
College Freshman,2,"Really not much variety at all.  The meal plan is expensive and the food is not healthy or good tasting at all.  As for other options where you have to pay, they really aren't all that great either.  You're almost better off going to the grocery store and cooking on your own."
College Freshman,2,Clemson on campus housing really isn't too good.  The highrises are small and fairly gross but have the benefit of being somewhat more social due to the large amount of freshmen.  Living in the shoeboxes has the benefit of being close to harcombe but no almost nothing social goes on over here.  Honestly take Johnstone over those two because of the pro social nature.  By far the best is Clemson House which has co-ed floors and great community between them.
College Freshman,2,"Finding where to apply for scholarships, and actually getting scholarships, from the school are very difficult. I feel as if I deserve more scholarships than I am receiving because of my outstanding performance academically at Clemson so far."
College Freshman,2,the dining halls are rough
College Freshman,2,"other than partying at night there is absolutely nothing to do in clemson, the ""downtown"" area is a tiny strip of shops (mostly restaurants) and then thats it for places to go or things to do, outside of campus its kinda gross"
College Junior,2,"I don't personally care for Greek life and I don't participate in it, but the fraternities have a worse reputation than the sororities."
Recent Alumnus,2,The security officers are power hungry.  They love to issue citations for anything and everything.  They tend to go out of their way to look for things to write students up for.
College Senior,2,"Greeks only hang out with Greeks. Period. They are loud stereotypes unless its a private business fraternity of a specific major. They get their own 4 dorms called ""the Quad"" which is apart from the rest of campus and nearest to the sports fields. There are also chapter houses littered around the area surrounding campus."
College Senior,2,Campus housing is almost exclusively for freshman. Upperclassmen MUST live off-campus and because of this rents tend to be expensive for being 40 minutes away from the nearest city.
College Senior,2,Sc laws make them close early
College Junior,2,Athletics are a waste of time and money.
College Freshman,2,I'm still broke. My family earns to much for assistance but its hard to afford classes here.
College Freshman,2,"Being from the north, it is very hard to get home. I have to arrange rides because Clemson offers limited services. It is always a big ordeal and so I can only go home a few times a year--another reason why I am transferring."
College Freshman,2,There is little to no diversity on Clemson's campus. Most students are white except for the athletes who do not really interact with the rest of the student body.
College Freshman,2,"The students at Clemson do not all apply themselves as much as they should. The university offers numerous resources for success  but because a majority of the students are from South Carolina, a state struggling with academic achievement, they do not understand the concept of trying in school. It is frustrating to work alongside some of the very unmotivated students here and that is one of the main reasons I have chosen to transfer."
College Freshman,2,"As a biological sciences major I have many things to say about Clemson's academic systems. I did not have to go through an extra application process to get into Biological Sciences because I was accepted directly into the major. One of the biggest challenges I have faced is communication with my academic advisor. The advisors are assigned so many kids that they do not even know your name when you walk into their office. They are not at all accessible, you can really only meet with them 2 times a year right before registration for classes because the university requires them to meet with students at this time. They offer limited help when picking classes and students are really on their own for navigating their way through their majors. It is no surprise that many students at Clemson end up graduating late because their advisor failed to inform them of general education classes that they are required to take. Other than the advising situation, however, Clemson's biological department is strong and the students really tend to apply themselves. I cannot really offer any tips for admission because of the fact that this program does not require a special application process separate from a normal application."
College Freshman,2,"Clemson itself is a town revolving around the University. The few people that choose to reside in the town are not very well off and so it is rare for students to interact with the locals. The ""downtown"" portion of Clemson is really just a singular street lined  with subpar restaurants and a few expensive clothing stores. Outside of Clemson's campus, there is very little to do. There are few recreational activities and the campus is located decently far from the beach as well as the mountains making these typically advertised aspects of the university less than appealing. There are really no cultural events around the campus due to the fact that the student body really lacks a culture. Most of the students are of white ethnicity and a majority are from South Carolina. These students tend to have prejudices from being raised in a southern home and therefore the Clemson population is not very accepting of people who stay from ""the norm"". The one thing Clemson does choose to focus its attention on is football. The town, and most of the state of South Carolina in fact, revolves around the sport. In my opinion, this is not enough to keep the university thriving. Students and alumni should be focusing more on  academic aspects of the university and less on the rank of the football team. Coming from the north, I expected Clemson to fit the southern mold I had dreamed about for so long. It turns out, the lifestyle is much different and I did not enjoy it as much as I anticipated. I will be transferring out next semester."
College Senior,2,"Tiger Transit is an excellent service to get around on campus after dark without having to worry, but saying that campus is ""safe"" seems kind of laughable when someone was recently sexually assaulted on it. There is not a very healthy environment for that here, but I don't hear about it happening a lot."
College Student,2,No very diverse at all. Very prejudice against Northerners and different religions
College Sophomore,2,Very rainy and gloomy most of school year
College Sophomore,2,"Almost everyone is upper-class, southern, white, and republican. There are a lot of hardcore Christians, but maybe I just think that way because I'm from New York which is kind of the complete opposite. You won't be looked down upon for your beliefs whatsoever, but it's hard not to notice the conformity just by looking around. All of the guys wear Ralph Lauren, Vineyard Vines, Southern Tide, etc. All of the girls wear bright Norts to class with big t shirts (I don't mind it)."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus PD isn't there to protect and serve the students, they're there to find kids drinking underage on campus and give them MIPs. That's it."
College Sophomore,2,"It's a small college town, so there's a very limited number of nightlife spots and they're all very similar. Most fall into the ""sports bar"" genre. There's one hole in the wall beer garden where you can get something other than crap American drafts and one sushi place that turns into this nightclub-esque place later at night. "
College Sophomore,2,"While Clemson University is not openly racist, bigotted or the like. It is very homogeneous.. The student population is predominantly southern, white, affluent and Christian.  "
Junior,1,"I have yet to take online classes with Clemson, for this is my first semester enrolled at the school."
Junior,1,"If you are a veteran, this is probably a bad choice. The VA certifying team is horrible to deal with, and trying to get anything done had been a complete nightmare. In addition, the engineering advising staff has been not so nice either. The lack of communication and response time for questions is what is concerning as well. My experience was bad from the beginning. The orientation was led by students who obviously didn’t want to be there and was extremely disorganized. As a civil engineering student, the labs I took were filled with broken equipment worth thousands of dollars, and a good amount of the computers available to students were in non working order. It’s surprising to see a school that seems to be so well funded fall to the wayside. But one thing is for sure, the money Clemson spent on the new stadium has surely came from the expense of the students education."
Junior,1,"Not enough classes offered online. Plus, you are still required to go onto campus to take tests. Also, they do not offer hardly any online degrees."
Junior,1,"Clemson University is a school centered around parties and athletics. The fans are not very nice and trying to get a ticket to any sports game without paying for it is impossible. The school was once prestigious for its academics in South Carolina, but that time has passed. The people in charge are looking to make the quick buck by accepting more people and having less standards. The one upside is if you like a your schools football team to be good, but all other sports to suffer for it then this is the place to go."
Freshman,1,The school is sleazy and terrible. The school's IPTAY program which was made to improve the school academically for athletes spent 55 million dollars of scholarship money on a building for 30 highly powered people to watch movies and eat food. Terrible school. I hate it here.
College Sophomore,1,It was cold. The RA's did not enforce the rules evenly (i.e. my neighbors played music and Grand Theft Auto all night long and I could never sleep. The workers of the building smoked in front of the air vents that circulated through the entire building even though the campus was tobacco free.) Everyone was rude. The bathrooms were nasty. No one ever cleaned the kitchen area. You could only have Micro-fridges which shorted out all of the time. Save yourself and don't live on campus.
College Sophomore,1,Barely any diversity whatsoever. The athletes are the extent of diverse students
College Sophomore,1,Dorms and on campus apartments are costly and not worth the price at all. Move off campus as soon as you can if you want to save money
College Freshman,1,Greek life is life on campus
College Freshman,1,This school makes it very difficult to have a social life.
College Sophomore,1,All of the ones I have met are snobbish and feel superior to their peers.
Recent Alumnus,1,"RAs are cool, so campus housing is great. Campus police lives to give out MIPs like candy. Parking services are children of satan."
College Junior,1,Do not come here for the food. Don't judge the school on it's food either.
College Sophomore,1,"I transfered and was basically treated like I was worthless to Clemson. Mind you I had a 3.9 GPA transferring in from another University so I was definitely an asset to Clemson. They don't ""allow"" transfer students to receive any scholarships and once I completed a semester and had a 3.8 GPA, I wasn't eligible for anything because my GPA was too low. One B and suddenly I'm not worthy of a scholarship. Also out of state and don't qualify for financial aid even though I can't afford 40,000 a year. Because I'm not dirt poor I'm supposed to be able to come up with that much money without any help."
College Freshman,1,"When applying for Clemson University, they chose to not give me any money. I had several peers that received financial aid from Clemson, however I received none. I was unsure why and would appreciate a little help over here."
College Freshman,1,"Dining halls do not cook food that is appealing to students. They make no effort to cook contemporary meals, therefore resulting in eggplant casserole. The dining halls repeatedly cook food that is weird and unsuitable for the appetite of a college student. I highly recommend that students eat in the dining hall as little as possible."
College Freshman,1,Police officers are jerks and bust people all the time for Minor in Possession.  RA's can be ok depending on where you live but some are also very strict.  Parking enforcement is the worst and you will get at least three tickets during your time here.  Clemson tries really hard to create a safe and politically correct environment and because of this they are very strict on alcohol and drug possession/use.
College Freshman,1,"The people here must all have a stick up their butt or something because the girls are catty and rude and so are the guys. People of both sexes are rude and don't encompass the idea of the ""clemson family"" at all."
College Freshman,1,"greek life is everything at clemson and those involved in greek life tend to only associate with other people in greek life, as someone who isn't in a frat or sorority (to the greeks Im called a GDI, and called so with a horribly negative tone) I don't really have an inside perspective but to those who choose not to participate we are NOTHING. All drunken parties, lots of hookups and cliquey, snobbish behavior."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life on campus creates a very negative atmosphere. Frat guys are typically pampered rich kids who have had everything handed to them in life, and consequentially believe they are superior to others. They typically walk around campus in a very self-important fashion, usually clad in pastel colors, boating shoes, and croakies, usually looking borderline homosexual - hilarious considering their rampant homophobia."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The Greek society is what holds back Clemson as far as diversity is concerned.  Clemson invests and allows investment from fraternity and sororities of money and allows a lot of amenities specifically to those in the Greek society.  It would be fine if every group (LGBT, Race, Socioeconomic background, etc.) were given the same amenities or given the same chance to be a part of the Greek system, but that is not the case.  Most Greeks hail to tradition accepting only white, protestant, American, males and females.  Alternate groups are encouraged to make their own fraternity or sorority chapter, but not included in the current ones.  

I believe that there needs to be less emphasis on sororities and fraternities and more attention to curriculum and campus activities."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I never lived in the dorms, I lived in the apartments which was my last pick for the lottery.  I think that because I got my last pick for the lottery system I think it did not have a very good logarithm for selecting housing for students.  The apartment was a 10 minute walk to my classes.  There was not a social atmosphere in the apartment as everyone kept to themselves.  The cost I came to find out was higher for on campus where I was living compared to many other places off campus.  I would recommend off campus living to Clemson Students."
College Freshman,1,The parking lots are so far for students and the parking services give tickets for everything. The prices are way too high just for parking. More parking should be available to students and not just teachers.
College Freshman,1,Clemson has about 4 off campus dining options. They are all overpriced and provide mediocre foods. There are no healthy options and a majority of the students just end up at chipotle every time they go downtown.
College Sophomore,1,"no clubs or anything, just frat parties"
College Sophomore,1,"I hate the greeks, EVERYONE is in a greek function"
College Sophomore,1,I hate frats and sororities on campus
College Freshman,1,"Parking is the one thing that sucks, they are constantly giving out tickets and towing cars for football other than that no complaints
"
College Freshman,1,guys on campus only care about partying and only like girls who party
College Freshman,1,I did not receive any aid
College Freshman,1,"Parking is miserable here, and there is a confusing system in place on where you can and can't park. The school makes you move on game weekends and people are getting ticketed and towed all the time. "
College Junior,1,Hugely disappointed with Clemson's parking services. The parking employees stand on duty and write tickets for hundreds of dollars and often have no sympathy for students. Faculty parking is everywhere and student parking is a 20-30 minute walk from classes. Doesn't really help for getting to class on time!
College Sophomore,1,No one cares about anything but football.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I did not recieve any financal aid from Clemson because I missed one state scholarship by 0.12 GPA. I would have not only recieved extra from the state, but also nearly $10,000 from Clemson. It is seriously ridiculous!"
College Sophomore,1,"Clemson is not a diverse campus and people can be extremely intolerant of others views. Clemson has a very conservative and very Christian student body. It is also predominantly Caucasian and straight, and people who do not fit this mold may unfortunately face some difficulties. Clemson really needs to work on becoming not only more diverse, but more accepting of those who are different."
College Junior,1,"Not about race, but how it is viewed by the white republican trash. They think they're country, they ain't. Terrible college experience. Stick out like a sore thumb if you want to."
College Junior,1,"Nightlife is GRUESOME. Truthfully, if you are not in a frat you may find yourself drinking alone in Johnstone"
College Senior,1,"The biggest issue affecting academia at Clemson right now is the parking in my opinion.  Of course, only a certain number of students can live on campus.  That leaves a tremendous amount of other students that are forced to live off campus.  If you are one of the many that must drive to campus, be prepared to arrive about 30-40 minutes (or more) early to campus.  It is a war zone trying to find parking on campus, and it's not getting any better!  Clemson is expanding it's horizon by building beautiful, new facilities, but with that the parking situation is increasingly worse.  Parking situations MUST be addressed by Clemson University, or else the students will continue to suffer a constant, everyday parking battle."
College Junior,1,"Financial aid at Clemson is a nightmare. The financial aid office always seems to be overloaded with calls, emails, and people. The representatives always seem rushed and their time estimations for certain things always seem to be less than actual and are already estimated to take months. However, the ladies are friendly. My suggestion would be to apply early, appeal early and have patience."
College Senior,1,Parking is extremely stressful if you are running late to avoid this all together I come to park just before the previous class lets out and normally there are a few random spots available at this time.  During rainy days always take advantage of the CAT bus! IT'S FREE!
College Junior,1,Parking is a nightmare here. Almost guaranteed to get ticketed at least once during your stay.
College Sophomore,1,"I was a transfer, so I am not eligible for any next semester"
College Freshman,1,The parking on campus sucks. They give tickets for every little thing and if you live on campus you can't even park in front of your building not even on the weekend.
College Freshman,1,Much of the financial aid at Clemson is spent on athletes which is frustrating at times.
College Freshman,1,What Nightlife? Downtown Clemson has three bars all of which are extremely crowded on weekends. These bars are also strictly 21 and up. The under 21 scene is mainly Frat parties which are difficult to attend if you do not participate on Greek life.
College Junior,1,"Parking is horrid. If you arrive to campus after 9 AM, plan to search for parking for 30+ minutes. Clemson is not friendly toward Graduate Assistants either. As university employees, one would hope for employee perks--not the case at Clemson. Come prepared to search for a spot and then follow up your search with a hike to your building... the parking lots are far from convenient. For the price of $120/year, it might be better to check out the bus system or invest in a bicycle."
College Freshman,1,"If you don't drink, you are not accepted. Period. If you don't drink and then on top of that don't smoke, the outcasts that don't drink but smoke will not accept you. If you don't drink, there is literally nothing else to do and you will have absolutely no fun and no friends."
College Junior,1,"Parking sucks around Clemson. The parking people are the worst, they will try and get you for every little thing, no matter what. If you do not have a sticker on your car, you will get a ticket, if it is not where it should be located on your car, you will get a ticket, if you are not allowed to park in a green or orange spot with no sticker showing you can park there, you will get a ticket; it goes on and on...trying to find a parking spot can be pretty bad as well depending on what time your classes are, especially for students living off campus, which is why most students take the bus so they do not have to worry about trying to find a spot."
College Sophomore,1,"Unfortunately, there are no rainbow passes for parking, so you have to purchase the appropriate decal and park in the correct lot, unless you don't mind the whopping tickets, ranging from $15-$115. They let you appeal your cases, but I firmly believe that they are trying to squeeze money out of us. They are very quick at catching mistakes if you make them. My cousin got ticketed for no definite reason, even though he followed the rules. It's too inconvenient to park in parking lots that are nowhere close to your classes."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Where do I begin.... I'll just say after two months of two stepping and partying it up in San Antonio, TX... Clemson is completely lame in comparison.  I'm afraid these people don't know how to have a serious good time unless your idea of a good time is standing around at bars that are all the same talking about nothing and drinking.  NO ONE DANCES :( and if you want to get to any apartment complexes they are all so far away."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking would be one of the biggest downfalls, if not the only downfall of Clemson University. You have to park so far away and take the area transit, which may take 15-20 min. It just makes getting to class a lot harder and having to allow at least 30 min of travel time."
College Junior,1,"The Worst in the World – parking on campus is horrible! the proximity of the parking lots to central campus aren't great and the decals can be very expensive. also parking services is notorious for distributing tickets rain, sleet, or snow. everyone hates parking services"
College Junior,1,The Worst – Clemson parking is the worse and parking services are real jerks when it comes to parking on campus. Parking also requires freshmen to move their cars for game day to the outskirts of campus. Clemsons is parking is the worst I've seen
College Junior,1,All Bars – Pretty much clemson is just a bunch of bars at night time especially on weekends
College Sophomore,1,The dorms are awful. After class I want to feel like I'm actually leaving school rather than going to a freezing hole in the wall.
College Freshman,1,Little to None – Financial aid seems to be impossible to come across and over the past few years Clemson has virtually eliminated ways to get in touch with aid. If you don't beg and plead beyond comprehension then scholarships are your only hope in paying for you education.
College Junior,1,"Another rough year ahead – I predict that athletics are not going to make any great strides in the coming years.  You can just feel the difference, no one really cares much about the games.  Thats not to say they don't attend, but losing gets old and everyone bails pretty quick.  I spent more time at other schools and it made realize I needed a change"
College Sophomore,1,"Bars and Fast Food – The only thing Clemson has is bars and fast food.  There are no unique, one of a kind restaurants that cities have. Its very boring and you know you're in a college town because of it."
College Sophomore,1,"Visit often and understand what your getting into. Before you come here really visit and ask questions. This is just my opinion, but this place gets very monotonous. I stuck it out for 2 years and am transferring. I wish I had transferred last year but I wanted to be really sure. The people are great but there is nothing to do other then frat parties.  There are a lot more northerners and that's great for diversity but not what I was looking for in a southern school. Really think about what you want in a school before you make such a long term decision."
College Freshman,1,"The food on campus is terrible. If you go to the dining hall don't expect anything great. There are places like the Canteen, Fernow Street Cafe, and Hendrix Student Center that have places to eat where you can't use meal plans to eat that are ok. But if you're on a meal plan then, tough for you."

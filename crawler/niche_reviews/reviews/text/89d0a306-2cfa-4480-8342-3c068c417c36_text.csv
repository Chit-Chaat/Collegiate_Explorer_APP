Freshman,5,"They are very quick to adapt to online learning! It is very easy to work through courses, and still an enjoyable experience!"
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here. I am a freshman and I could not be more pleased! The campus is gorgeous, close to ocean city, and super friendly! The classes are educational but not overbearing. It's a perfect size, not too small. Please look at SU, it has something for everyone :)"
Graduate Student,5,The online experience is just as awesome as being on campus. The professors make it really interactive through social media and the response time is phenomenal.
Graduate Student,5,"The overall experience is awesome. The professors, advisors and the entire staff population goes above and beyond to assist. I chose Salisbury because of my program in Social Work and their ratings on the program as one of the best in the country."
Sophomore,5,"Salisbury University has been great online considering the quick transition due to the coronavirus. The university helped the students through all hardships we experienced from having the dramatic change. From previous experience, I do enjoy online classes. The professors make it very clear of the instructions and expectations for the class. No wiggle room for online! (From my experience)"
Sophomore,5,"Salisbury University has been amazing for me. The environment is great with faculty and students. Everyone is welcomed and SU makes that known the very first day of orientation! Speaking of the environment, games and other SU activities are so much fun. Salisbury University is a place to have fun and be family away from home! (Or another family at home for locals!) Salisbury University is the perfect place to grow. I am on my second year at SU and have been through so much with students and faculty behind my back to support me. There are so many resources so any student will never not have someone."
Alum,5,I had a great experience here. Everyone was committed to my success and helped me as much as possible. I gained a lot of skills that I used in the real world.
Alum,5,Online learning is wonderful. The courses were paced well and the professors were always responsive to my needs.
Alum,5,My experiences were at a satellite campus. Our site coordinator and professors were excellent. The only thing I would have liked to have seen improved was the communication and involvement with the main campus.
Alum,5,Professors communicated well making online courses easy to navigate. I had no complaints about the online courses I took.
Junior,5,I love how everyone is welcoming and makes it feel like you’re at a home away from home. People will respect you if you respect yourself and others. The environment is relaxed and humbling.
Junior,5,"I love Salisbury University. The professors really care about their students learning and overall well-being. I believe the administration handled COVID-19 related information very well. I would highly suggest attending this university. The campus is a great size and is quite beautiful. The people are friendly, and for the most part inclusive of everyone. There have been trying times recently even before the COVID-19 outbreak, but instead of dividing the campus, everyone came together to support one another. I am very proud to call my self a Gull. In addition to strong academic opportunities, there are a variety of extracurricular opportunities available on campus. Salisbury truly is an amazing school, and I've met some of my closet friends at Salisbury. I miss campus very dearly and hope to be there this upcoming fall."
Freshman,5,"Love the school. Great campus, food, and activities! The staff is all very helpful with registration as well. Especially during this pandemic."
Junior,5,"I am a junior at Salisbury University. I had recently transferred from Umbc to Salisbury due to the fact it wasn’t good for me. Everyone maryland university student knows umbc has peer pressure on drugs/ parties and bad influence to many of its students and every teacher tries to fail you somehow. Salisbury has given me the opportunity I need to succeed. The teachers try to help you in every way possible, there are many new programs for medicine,law,business etc. It’s a quiet nice environment to be in and all the students are friendly. My grades is getting better from all the resources the teachers provide me rather than the umbc ones trying to fail me! Thank you Salisbury!"
Freshman,5,"Salisbury is an excellent school with great academics and facilities. It's awesome because you don't need amazing grades to get in and can still get a high-class education. They have an accredited business school and there are not many business schools that have that. The school is the perfect size, it is not too big that you will get lost but not so small that it feels like high school. The population is around 8-10,000 students. We have excellent sports to go watch whenever you can. There are many clubs and organizations to join, there's always something to do. We are 30-40 minutes away from the beach so when it gets warm outside you can take a trip with your friends to the beach. The teachers are so nice and willing to help you outside of class. There are so many resources to help you if you are struggling with a class. We have many tutors that can help with a variety of subjects. We have a separate ""math emporium"", a writing center, and my favorite Supplemental instruction."
Niche User,5,"I went on a tour during their Juniors Day last spring. The guides and the administration were very nice, eager to assist you and make you feel comfortable on the campus."
Niche User,5,"I live in Salisbury, and have attended several events at the Salisbury University campus. The campus is always clean, and feels safe & secure. I never worry about walking to my car when I am there, or feel any concern for my well-being."
Senior,5,"My time at Salisbury University is definitely one to remember.  Transferring here going into my sophomore year was initially for field hockey, but every aspect of the school has exceeded my expectations.  The professors will make sure that they can assist as best as you can with flexible office hours and quick email responses.  Like any other college campus, students can be at risk walking around areas alone late at night.  Salisbury ensures student safety with numerous safety stands where you can call an officer to help you if you are in trouble and will even escort you to your destination.  The large variety of different food services around campus gives students plenty of options in almost every building to grab a quick snack or drink in between classes if they do not have time to go home or sit down at the dining hall."
Niche User,5,"When I first came to visit Salisbury University, I was like ""Wow, okay. I did not expect to have this feeling of being home."" I felt super comfortable and the students and staff are so incredibly nice. It is truly a wonderful atmosphere to be in. When I got my acceptance letter from SU, I was so excited that I literally had no words. It was my first acceptance letter and on top of that, it was from the school that I had always wanted to go to! I was so happy and I will forever remember that moment. SU is also close to Ocean City, which is perfect because I love the beach and Ocean City, itself. Salisbury University is my dream school and they made my dream come true. :)"
Niche User,5,I visited the campus once and I love it. The tour guides were really cool and nice too. Love the food and also love the activities going around the campus.
Freshman,5,"Salisbury University in my view so far, is a great college that’s not so big which eliminates the stress about getting lost almost instantly. The professors there are very generous, always available if needed, and try to make the class enjoyable."
Junior,5,I love the atmosphere at Salisbury. The housing is a steal for the price your paying. The social life is great as well as the diversity. There’s always something to do at Salisbury!
Works Here,5,I liked doing a internship at the school. I also enjoyed the pace and instructors for several courses I studied there. I would like to see them change their structure for on campus studies and offer distance learning.
Niche User,5,"The campus was extremely lively all hours of the day. Everyone is really sociable, there is tons to do in the area and it is relatively easy to get to."
Niche User,5,"It felt like home..... I was comfortable during my  visit and loved the campus. Change nothing.Thats how I felt when I arrived on campus...Home.. The feel you get when you step on Campus is incredible, its inviting is so many ways from the landscape to the people on campus welcoming you. The surrounding area feels safe as does the campus. Im very excited about a opportunity to attend this college and starting another exciting chapter in my life to further my education and grow as a person and walk away from the university with a education and a future to educate others."
Junior,5,"Small town with character. When it rains, there is never a puddle. The university has great professors and amazing resources for students to use at any time."
Sophomore,5,I liked the size of the campus it is big enough to have my own space but small enough to recognize and be comfortable around other students.
Senior,5,Salisbury University is very great! I have made a lot of friends here and I work various different jobs on campus. I have a great connection with all of my bosses and even with some of my professors. It has a beautiful campus that  anyone would immediately fall in love with.
Senior,5,"Salisbury University is an excellent university for all students. It is a medium sized school, not too overwhelming for freshmen but also not too small for a transfer student. Student housing is available for everyone but there are also great apartments all over the city. The beach is a huge seller for Salisbury students, with ocean city being only 30 minutes away! It's a small time vibe mixed with city living, the perfect duo!"
Freshman,5,Great school.  Great location.  Professors and coaches  very hands on.  Reach out on a regular basis to help with my transition from HS
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my freshman year at this university. I love everything about the school. The professors are always willing to help in class and at their office hours; most professors also have student aides who have hours throughout the week. The campus is beautiful by itself and very clean. Everyone is welcoming with open arms, especially the staff. The people who help with FAFSA and GULLNET on campus are so caring and understanding. We have a newer library which is beyond beautiful. Salisbury overall is a great school to attend. Go Gulls!"
Freshman,5,"Better food and better teachers in certain areas. There are some teachers who do not want to help at all and do not care about your education. Food gets old and there are not many choices, and when there are good food options, they tend to butcher it and make it taste bad. There are also not many healthy choices"
Freshman,5,I believe that the teachers really care about the students and are truly dedicated  to giving them a bright future. The staff at SU are very friendly and strive to make the students lives the best they can.
Freshman,5,"My experience with Salisbury was amazing. The people and staff are the nicest people I met, becoming an incoming freshman it was really important to get this connection with everyone and feel at home, which is actually how I felt. I am super excited to attend this school in the fall!"
Niche User,5,"I am a transfer student at Salisbury University.  The campus is very easy to follow. The people who go there are super nice and will go out of there way to make your day great. The transfer admissions were very helpful in making my transition to Salisbury as smooth as possible. The athletics department helps you decide if you want to continue your sports career and to know if its a great fit for you. The campus overall is a great campus, the dorms are very nice, the food is good, and there are many places to go off campus as well."
Sophomore,5,"I have had some of the most amazing professors here at Salisbury University. Overall, my time here has been amazing and I've loved every minute of it."
Freshman,5,"As my first year at Salisbury, I am pleased with the accommodations and campus life we have here. The dorms could use some work but they are livable. Just minor issues, like too hot in rooms or old, moldy bathrooms that get clogged or flooded easily. The food in Commons is okay, roughly all the same food everyday minus occasional ""special"" meals they have in the Bistro. The campus is very pretty in the summer and spring months which make walking to classes pleasant and the buildings are all pretty close so you never have to walk more than 10 minutes to a specific building. Professors are kind and know a lot of valuable information relating to life and the specific class. The area around Salisbury is also very nice, including lots of places to eat off campus and things to do. Greek Life is not that popular but frats tend to have all the parties, some sports team will have parties but they get busted easily."
Alum,5,"Salisbury University offers a quality education in a medium sized college town. Aside from a wide range of academic options- organizations, clubs, and sports teams are a huge emphasis for every student."
Sophomore,5,"Very nice school. Everyone pretty friendly. Only complaint, dorm has mold and they wouldn't do anything about it except run humidifiers."
Niche User,5,"Salisbury University is an amazing four-year university located in Salisbury, Maryland. They offer many majors and minors, clubs for anything you can think of, athletics, and so much more. Their admissions recruiters for Worcester County are so, so amazing! Very helpful and kind when they visited our high school. Awesome school to attend!"
Freshman,5,"Love this place. Best college you can choose, amazing price for an amazing school. Perfect size and everyone here is so nice and welcoming. Parties are also very fun😉"
Alum,5,SU is a wonderful school for students that want to take on leader positions in clubs and on campus organizations to build a resume before they graduate. The campus is beautiful and dorms have all been revamped. The food is also outstanding.
Sophomore,5,"Great value for the price of tuition. Small class sizes and many caring professors and faculty. The Library is amazing, one of the nicest I've seen at a college."
Niche User,5,"As a parent of two Salisbury graduates I can tell you that we truly loved my daughter's success there, and sent our son three yrs. later.
The communication was incredible which I thank Salisbury for that. we knew what was going on through the newsletters and websites.

My son has been a successful graduate as well. Not a fun drive at all but overall I can't say enough great things."
Alum,5,Salisbury University is a growing university. My experience was positive. The new facilities really helped my education.
Senior,5,"Diverse students, clubs&organizations, activities and classes. A well balanced school between fun and challenging. Greatly recommended if your looking for affordable universities in Maryland"
Junior,5,Salisbury is Great!! It’s the perfect size and the campus is beautiful. Class sizes are just right. I’ve had the opportunity to create close relationships with my professors and other classmates.
Freshman,5,Salisbury is a great university I love the way the classes size because you get to know your professor and mates. I don’t think I’ll change anything else but the cost of the university
Sophomore,5,"Personally, I absolutely love Salisbury University. The campus is not only beautiful, but it's full of events and friendly students that help you stay entertained in between difficult and challenging courses! The professors are incredibly helpful, most if not all always available by email to answer questions even if you have probably left that particular assignment just a bit too late."
Junior,5,"I love Salisbury! The classroom sizes are usually small and since the school is rather small you see a lot of the same people around campus. All of my professors have been friendly and very open to helping students one-on-one. The dining commons has great food and even has vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. Some dorms are better than others but they are actively renovating the worst one with the rest to follow soon."
Sophomore,5,"Salisbury is one of the best decisions I have ever made. The campus is beautiful, the professors work with you for your benefit, and the people are great."
Junior,5,"I transferred to Salisbury after a horrific experience at another college.  I love this college.  It is close to local beaches.  I had an instance on the campus of a stranger approaching me to ask for change.  I ignored him and called my parents, who immediately called security, within seconds they phoned me and asked where I was at, was I safe, and where and what the person who approached me was wearing.  They have cameras all around the college and immediately sent someone to the are and viewed cameras and footage to look for suspect.  The Physical Education program so far has been great.  The professors are down to earth and classes are enjoyable."
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student and I could not have chosen a better school. I have enjoyed all of my classes, my professors have been great so far, and I greatly enjoy the extracurricular clubs and activities Salisbury University offers."
Freshman,5,This college definitely values their students and provides great opportunities for everyone and anyone who attends this University.
Junior,5,Love the school and I have had nothing but amazing teacher that love their jobs. Even when you have huge classes if you make an effort to talk to your teachers they will know you and help. I love my major and I am practically guarantied a job after I graduate. I love this school
Niche User,5,Great school! good food and friendly people. nice area with lots to do around town. i recommend for other upcoming freshmen.
Sophomore,5,"Salisbury University offers a wide variety of programs, academic assistance, and opportunities for all students. The professors are all very helpful and are there for any last minute needs or questions. This campus offers so many helpful resources if a student is having a difficult class at any time, and offers free tutoring and outside class sessions almost 24/7. Although i have only been here a short time, i couldn't imagine myself at any other university, and couldn't imagine not having all of these beneficial resources at the tip of my fingers."
Freshman,5,Salisbury is a great school through visits and on going research on my future school. The night life is great and also the university is near ocean city with a great environment of people around you. Not very far from home and in a nice rural area where students can stay safe and have fun. I'm very excited about my future there.
Freshman,5,Salisbury University is located right in the center of Salisbury Maryland. It has a bunch of job opportunities and restaurants to explore. There is a mall is only about 10 minutes away so whenever you need a break from school.
Alum,5,I love Salisbury! It was the perfect distance away from my hometown and provided me with a lot of opportunities that helped me enter the workforce immediately after graduation. Some of my best friends are those I met while at SU!
Freshman,4,"Salisbury University is a good school. Campus is gorgeous and the weather is still beautiful in October. They have student activities every few days such as Movie Under the Stars on Saturday nights. They try to help students be as active in the community as possible which is very helpful in quarantine. Teachers grade very particularly and I got screwed on so many assignments because I didn't read the fine print. There's a Chickfila on campus so it's a common food place to frequent. Overall, I'm very very glad that I went here."
Freshman,4,"I’m a current freshman at Salisbury University. I’m very happy with the campus and how they have been following Covid guidelines while still making this an enjoyable experience for on-campus students. They have provided many opportunities to connect with other students and be involved in the community. Although, there are often times where all there is to do is sit around in your dorm. The food has been very disappointing this year, especially for students with food allergies. The options are extremely limited for more picky eaters, but if you’re the type to just eat anything then it’s not a huge nuisance. It’s hard to judge the athletics and party scene this year with Covid, but past stories and distanced events I’ve seen have seemed promising. I generally find the main campus to be very safe and I feel comfortable walking by myself (female) alone, however off-main campus at night is a different story. In all, I’ve had a good time and plan on staying the next four years."
Freshman,4,"Online learning has been mostly successful; the professors have a very good handle on how they are approaching teaching virtually. Although, this means a majority of the learning is the duty of the student. If you’re not the type to learn something on your own time, then virtual learning will not work. It’s difficult since the professors can only provide the means for a student to learn but in return they have to put in equal effort to see results. Currently I feel like the workload isn’t unbearable (stem major), and oftentimes have free time. However time management is key with online classes, and it’s better to get ahead early. Luckily however, a lot of the professors have been switching to inclusive access or e-textbooks, which are free or much cheaper versions of the print copies that would be required for in-person classes."
Senior,4,"I took all my Spring 2020 semester classes online. The university was quick to aid students and professors in the transition and provided continued support throughout the process. The MyClasses platform and Zoom platform was well maintained and professors rose to the challenge quite well. It does not replace in-person learning, but it could have been worse."
Senior,4,"My experience at Salisbury has been enjoyable. There are lots of opportunities to get involved, academics are challenging and (mostly) well funded, and there's a good faculty to student ratio. The administration does have a bad habit of ignoring student voices, and the COVID-19 pandemic caused confusion. However I feel that Salisbury University met my expectations and is helping me succeed academically and personally."
Junior,4,It is an awesome campus. The professors make almost every class enjoyable and you get to meet so many people who you can just click with right away.
Freshman,4,"My first semester was an adjustment but there was always something to do and it was easy to meet people.  By the second semester I had a great group of new friends, and was doing ok academically."
Freshman,4,"My classes for my second semester ended up all being online due to covid19. It was an adjustment for sure, but my professors were overall available and helpful when I had questions and needed help."
Sophomore,4,"I had a good first year, most professors I encountered were very nice and helpful. There was some racial graffiti on campus but most students and faculty stood in solidarity to show that these views are not tolerated at Salisbury."
Sophomore,4,I have not taken any online classes through Salisbury yet but I am sure I will this coming fall due to certain circumstances.
Sophomore,4,The campus is great and everyone is very friendly. The pandemic has impacted how the college will run this year but everyone is doing a great job trying to keep it as normal as possible.
Junior,4,"Overall a great small school, that one can see there future vault from! The campus is small and easy to navigate but also calm and welcoming. Haven't met many teachers I don't love, and who don't respect me or my time!"
Junior,4,My teachers adapted as much as they possibly could. Our online classes with zoom went decently well overall. I prefer in class meetings to motivate myself to pay attention more but Salisbury university did a great job adjusting to change.
Junior,4,"My professors did a good job transitioning to online learning. Some of my professors are not tech-savvy and they did a great job with the transition. Although learning course material online was difficult due to the content, I believe my professors tried their best to make assignments easier to complete. Overall, my experience with online learning was fairly good, but I am praying that we are going back to campus for the fall 2020 semester."
Freshman,4,"I have overall had a great experience at Salisbury -- while it does have a reputation as a party school among Marylanders, I feel that your experience just depends on what you want and who you surround yourself with. It's possible to find a balance between having fun and still being very invested in academics, which I really like as a pre-nursing major. I've had great experiences in my science, history, and Spanish classes and am also a student athlete. I really enjoy participating in D-3 athletics. My only major complaints are that I had one bad experience with a professor in the Honor's college, and am planning on dropping out of that eventually, and from my point of view as a white person, definitely notice that the school is not as diverse as it could be. Other than that I love it at Salisbury and can't wait to come back."
Sophomore,4,"Salisbury University has a beautiful campus!! There's a decent amount of professors who actually care about our success, but also a good amount who just show up for a paycheck and don't care whether we pass or fail. We had faced a few racial issues this year on campus from an outside individual and our campus really came together and supported those impacted by the situation. We are an extremely different type of people when it comes to partying, but usually safe and have tons of fun."
Graduate Student,4,I started off with the hybrid program before studying at the main campus. The academic community is not bad and the library is really good and the technology. A bit pricey but scholarship favors undergraduate students than graduate students.  Predominantly caucasian but embracing diversity.
Sophomore,4,"The overall dynamic and atmosphere at Salisbury University is very welcoming and friendly. Although on the smaller side, it allows for deeper and more meaningful relationships with professors and other students."
Junior,4,I would like the financial aid office to be more personable and help more with questions and answers.
Niche User,4,I like how all of the building are close and clean. It’s easy to get from one building to another. The commons is amazing and I love the free events they have.
Niche User,4,Salisbury University has a beautiful campus with seemingly unlimited resources. I took a Statistics course there this past semester and the teacher was clear and helpful in her lectures/notes.
Freshman,4,I am a freshman so I can't really say too much about my experience here but so far it has been well. All my current professors are great and teach very well. They ensure that their students understand what they are teaching to the class. Other staff members are very friendly and willing to help you if you're confused.
Niche User,4,Salisbury University is an excellent and is a medium size. Its not too big nor too small.  Student housing is available for everyone and Ocean City is only 30 minutes away! It's a small time vibe mixed with city living!
Senior,4,"I transferred to Salisbury during the spring semester of sophomore year. Immediately I felt included and involved as I began to make friends in the classroom and within the different organizations I joined. The campus is beautiful and walkable which makes getting from class to class an ease. The facilities and services offered on campus are great. My professors have also taught me a lot, some of which I have carried with me outside of the classroom. There is something for everyone at SU which makes it the perfect school."
Niche User,4,I am a transfer student. I have been away from college for quite some years. The staff and faculty at Salisbury University have helped to make my transition back into higher education as stress free as they possibly could. I have appreciated all the assistance I have received. I look forward to attending Fall 2019 semester at SU.
Sophomore,4,I am a nursing student which means difficult classes but the professors are very helpful. Dorm life is very enjoyable and I have been able to form great friendships through the school
Sophomore,4,"The people at salisbury university made me feel very welcome. They encouraged me to join clubs and meet new people. The atmosphere is very welcoming, the advisors I met were also very encouraging. Most of the professors are very passionate about what they do and they make it clear that they are there for the students."
Alum,4,"Small college but felt like a big college. The professors are amazing. I lived in Seagull Square which is an apartment style dorm on campus which was great. 

The food is pretty good but not a lot of variety, I ended up buying a lot of frozen dinners and foods to eat in my dorm. There are a lot of fast food places and restaurants around which I went to frequently. The immediate town area is a little sketchy too."
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far at Salisbury University has been positive. The school has a good culture and good STEM programs and courses. It is known as a ""party school"" so there are always things going on. The surrounding city isn't too active sometimes though."
Junior,4,"The campus is just the right size, and the community is very friendly. There are tons of organizations to be involved in, and to dedicate your time to."
Senior,4,"I'm nearing my last semester at SU and for the most part i have enjoyed my time here. i've learned a lot and built great relationships along the way. with all that said there are some areas of improvement the university can make. 
for starts parking is a hug issue on campus. there is never enough space yet everyone trying to park has a pass. there are off campus lots yes but it is always a battle to find a spot. another issue is the actual price of he parking passes themselves. i am a Salisbury resident but if i want to park directly on campus i have to pay $150 per year to park 10 minuets away from my house. More students should be encouraged to bike to campus and there should be a shuttle bus for commuters. if that was an option i would take the shuttle everyday rather than paying a large amount of money only to have to fight for a parking spot."
Niche User,4,I took a tour here and I really enjoyed the safe atmosphere and the student activities posted everywhere. The people were very nice and they seemed to make education a priority as well as supporting the arts. I enjoyed seeing the representation of school spirit posted on the walls with posters of movie nights and other sponsored activities.
Freshman,4,"Salisbury is an AMAZING University, there are a few areas that could use improvement. Yet, the one thing I do genuinely appreciate is how every single staff member is dedicated to helping the students."
Alum,4,I majored in Environmental Studies and all of the faculty in my department was amazing.  Most of the people on campus are from Maryland or New York and are pretty friendly.
Sophomore,4,"As a student attending Salisbury University, I have enjoyed my time spent here. I have made new friends and many new connections. While I am now a Fine Arts Major, the immense amount of support and help that I received from the Universities staff was incredible. I will say that the parking situation on Campus is terrible. All parking passes are outrageously expensive and I feel as though they do not take it into account how much we are already paying for our education. As a student who is not on campus all of the time, when you are on campus there is plenty to do and keep you occupied. Greek life is growing on our campus as we have many people involved. Overall, I love my school and I am excited to continue my education here."
Niche User,4,It was a great experience to learn the development of new buildings coming through. People there are more likely active. Safety on campus are on point because they have a emergency system where students are able to connect with.
Freshman,4,"Salisbury is a very nice school for education. The campus is small, but very well kept and pretty. The campus itself has art displays all over. Food here is very good,  I like how they try to have food events."
Freshman,4,This college has a very friendly environment. All the students are so nice and outgoing. The campus is very pretty. There’s no way you won’t have some new friends by the end of the first semester.
Freshman,4,"I enrolled in Salisbury because I wanted a fresh clean slate. People around town will ask me if I miss the city with it's ""guns and knives"". I chuckle. I've always enjoyed the small town environment. The campus area is very walkable, beautiful, and drama free as long as don't partake in the party scene elsewhere like me. Many of my professors have been very helpful in addition to the 24hr section of the gorgeous library. The food is great and the financial aid office works wonders for students in financial binds."
Sophomore,4,I'm about to start my sophomore year and I'm really nervous but excited. The last two semesters I've had at Salisbury have been stressful but fun. I've made life long friends and explored new concepts. I'm currently majoring in the field of creative writing. There's never a dull moment even when silence falls something interesting is always happening on campus. It has encouraged me to break out of my shell and I even joined a club. I could not be more enthused with my overall experience.
Niche User,4,I liked how diverse the school is and also how everyone is very welcoming. The food is also really nice and I recommend you to try it! There is no problems that I have faced with this school and I encourage everyone to give them a chance.
Alum,4,"Great education, great atheletics with the best facilities! Salisbury is continuing to grow and expand and with it grows it's students! You have a city feel, without the hustle and bustle!"
Junior,4,"I love Salisbury's campus, especially in the spring. The professors are usually always available to help and want you to come to office hours to help you succeed."
Junior,4,"My first year at Salisbury University was a great experience. I admit that when I first settled at Salisbury I was an introvert and barely attended any activities. Later in the year I started attending more events and becoming more sociable because of the diversity and versatility of the school. As this last semester just ended I looked up and had twice as many friends and associates than I had at the beginning of the semester. It’s safe to say that it is really easy to get involved in a lot of clubs and programs at Salisbury because of the variety. Not only is the variety outstanding but there are clubs, programs and activities that relate to the many ethnic backgrounds at Salisbury so every student has a chance to get involved."
Sophomore,4,"Salisbury is a small school so there are tons of opportunities to partake in research! The class sizes are generally small so you are able to build a better relationship with your professors. The food is just so-so, but that is to expected of a college campus."
Alum,4,Solid mid-major school with a great mascot.  Get a lot of bang for your buck at this mid-sized school.  You feel like a big fish in a small pond.  Short drive to the beach doesn't hurt either.
Junior,4,"Salisbury University is a great school if one is looking to be a face in the crowd. Campus is fairly small and educational building are in a relative walking distance. Class sizes range from about 20-30 students. I've had nothing but great teachers since I've transferred from my community college. The adjust was nice and simple. Never had the chance to live on campus due to being a transfer, but there is a good selection of off campus housing that fluctuate in price. In addition there is a wide food selection, and we are close to bigger shopping centers. Only downside is that it's a little noisy at times and the cafeteria food is average, and could be better. They do have additional food locations on campus that are very tasty."
Junior,4,"Salisbury University is situated in a large town, with a 30 minutes drive to the nearest beach. It's largely underestimated thanks to it sharing a school system with UMD and Johns Hopkins, but nevertheless, the school is humble. With great programs (esp. for teaching and med majors) with a great price tag, Salisbury University is a school that invests in success."
Freshman,4,"Being in Salisbury has been a blast. Its a fairly small school which makes things a lot easier. You don't have to walk far to go to class or to grab something to eat. The classroom sizes are fairly small which means you're able to interact with your teacher just like you would in high school. The school does a lot so that students can achieve, and my first semester has been one that I won't forget."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Salisbury University has been a lot better than I initially anticipated, especially concerning the education level and classroom experience. When entering the school, students can not only expect friendly encounters, but a lively social scene."
Senior,4,"They have a fair amount of options for majors and a good selection of opportunities for the future, at least from the perspective of a STEM major. The activities are sub-par, however, and revolve mainly around a more party atmosphere than anything else. There are many great professors here, but there are also some that are not so great, but that will be anywhere. The campus itself is beautiful and not that large, plus the tuition is less than other places."
Freshman,4,"So far, I have had a relatively good experience at Salisbury University. There are very few areas in which I have experienced problems. For the first time in my life, I do not dread going to class every day. My teachers make my classes interesting and teach the material in a way that everyone in the class can understand. The academics are my favorite part of Salisbury University. Although Salisbury itself is not the most beautiful college town, the campus is appealing and very well kept. I have found most of the people that I have met to be very friendly and inclusive. I look forward to what the next 3 years at Salisbury University will bring!"
Freshman,4,"I didn't expect to like it here so much, because I thought I was going to transfer ASAP to try for my reach school again. But now that I've been here all freshman year, transferring is the furthest thing from my mind."
Senior,4,"The professors are very willing to help students with anything they need, such as additional resources for learning or for any campus knowledge."
Junior,4,"This campus is located on the beautiful eastern shore of Maryland. Salisbury in itself is like a little city, big town atmosphere. Sometimes I feel that the campus needs more ways to interact with the community of salisbury md. This is a progressive university with many diverse ways of teaching and the professors value feedback as well as comments during lectures and classes."
Junior,4,"I attended Salisbury University for 2 years and in those 2 years I enjoyed my time at Salisbury University. I liked the appearance and ambiance of the campus. They have a great business program, there are others but I was strictly involved with their business program. There are a lot of school organizations which cater to almost every kind of person. There are also, a lot of opportunities to learn new skills and talents. The change I would like to see made would be more places to park."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful! Especially when the seasons start to change from Summer to Fall because of the leaves that change color. Sometimes I think the on- campus housing is a little over priced however it's better than other schools and depending where you live, the rooms are very nice. I do wish that there were more businesses downtown because it lacks some flare."
Sophomore,4,Lots of cool people and good friends to be made. Anyone can find someone with similar interests. its a school full of diversity but seems a little separated by ethnicity.
Sophomore,4,Salisbury University is a very diverse and active community to be apart of. There is always something happening and new people to meet. They are always renovating building and creating bigger and better facilities to enhance the learning experience of students.
Sophomore,4,School is a very good school. Most teachers care about your success. They need to work on the other teachers who notice kids failing their class but do not do anything to change it. Campus is really pretty. Need better food at Commons. The new library is very nice.
Freshman,2,"Growing up in Montgomery County and coming here is a big culture shock. It is a small town and there is only so much you can do. They try to sell this school as being diverse, but it's the opposite. In most classes there are only a 2-3 poc. As a freshman, you're required to get the most expensive meal plan, but the majority of the freshman eat out since the food is so bad. There is also a lack of diverse food options, only ""american"" fast food."
Freshman,2,The online learning experience here is virtually just teaching yourself and having an hour class where the professor just asks if there is questions and assigns more work.
Junior,2,"Administration is an absolute joke, on campus housing is terrible. Housing department is very dishonest."
Junior,2,"Online classes were absolutely awful, very poorly managed. Professors made it very difficult and were not easy to work with. Very disorganized"
Sophomore,2,"At first many students, myself included, are blinded by the freedom of college and do not take in the consideration of most of the important facts. It is a lovely feeling to get that freedom for many students, but Salisbury gives you a rude awakening of the life around you. The food is the same every two weeks and it is rare to find food that you like at the one dining place that you are offered. It is not often that you are able to find professors that you can really connect with which makes your stay at Salisbury that much more difficult. The advisors are very friendly to your face, but they all have different answers when asked the same question which could lead you down the wrong path.  The also do not give you the information you need when furthering your education with a major. The surrounding area is continuing to get much worse and has become very unsafe for the students. Many students living off-campus choose to stay inside instead of going out purely for their safety."
Junior,2,"As a minority raised in Montgomery county on the west side of Maryland, I 
 think Salisbury does not live up to the standards that this website claims. It is not diverse and the majority of students are white, racist, and ignorant about many things. After attending 2 years, I decided to transfer because I can't take the rural life anymore. People doing drug partying, wearing backwards caps at business meetings, only fast food restaurants, and everyone asking if I work at that asian restaurant! The most famous conversation around here is how much people hate this city. Overall the College has great academics and the professors really care about their students......in the business field. I had taken biology, history, and arts and its depressing af. Every professor other than Business feels like they have sleep issues."
Alum,2,"Salisbury is an ok place to go if your goal is just to finish up with school. The party scene is over the top because it’s a very immature and disgusting binge drinking culture. I found it difficult to make friends if you didn’t start as a freshman or aren’t part of Greek life. There’s nothing to do in the area, and the campus never had anything going on. I did however enjoy the academics of it- which is what we’re paying for. The library is an incredible resource, and the teachers are caring and take the time to help you learn. The food on campus is ok too. I think my biggest issue with Salisbury is the parking, and lack of public transportation. The bus system they have set up is horrible and will make you late to class. Honesty getting my degree and being done feels good, I’ll miss my professors but I don’t recommend this school."
Sophomore,2,"Salisbury University has a beautiful campus in the fall. It has begun to become a bigger school. The town is definitely center around SU and its many events. There is plenty to get involved with hear and good sports. I believe they could develop better support programs for the students. They say you will get the small town feel and individualized help. But, that has not been the case for me and many other students. There seems to be a disconnect between many of the departments and what they can do for a student can be very limited. Most of the time it seems like a wild goose chase between offices like disability support services and advising for me at least. "
College Junior,2,The Greek community doesn't do much for the school in any way other than allowing students to find friends in a social group setting.
College Senior,2,It's very prevelant on campus however there is a lot of drama associated with alot of the organizations on campus that can sometimes discourage non Greeks from joining.
College Freshman,2,"For me, I got the best freshman dorm on campus. Next year I'll be in an average dorm. The difference between the best and worst dorms is pretty significant."
College Junior,2,"I think that actually being on campus is pretty safe, but places like university park and new/old zoo are not safe to live in. Students places get broken into all the time because the Salisbury area is a little dangerous. There should be more security guards, not necessarily cops."
College Sophomore,2,Most people don't like the students in greek life
College Sophomore,2,"My mother is a single parent and has been since I was 5 years of age. The Financial aid says that my mother makes too much to receive any aid however, she struggles to help pay for my schooling."
College Freshman,2,"Upon applying to SU I was offered a merit-based scholarship. I'm now in the middle of my freshman year and have decided I would like to change my major, but since my major is in a different school my scholarship will be revoked."
College Freshman,2,"The city is really small and has many bad neighborhoods around the college. Things to do off campus is always driving, but usually only 15 or 30 mins away. Also, the only things close by is a mall, outlets, and Ocean City which I'm not complaining about that. Since there's not much to do, most people go home on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,I don't really know much about all the parties because I only went to a couple. Some of the parties you have to pay to get in or some of the people who hosts parties are racist so they don't let colored people in which is ridiculous cause are school is so diversed. Nobody really goes to the sports team parties cause a couple of the teams roofied girls.
College Freshman,2,"As an out of state student, you do not receive much financial aid."
College Freshman,2,a lot of fast food eateries
College Freshman,2,RAs are pain in the pASS.
College Freshman,2,sketchy neighborhood. no really a college campus.
College Freshman,2,The area surrounding the university is full of theft and murder and just pure sketchiness.
College Junior,2,"NOT SAFE!! Salisbury is a very dangerous area, and honestly it is cheaper to live off campus but the options are limited unless you want to be in the middle of a bad neighborhood with chances of being robbed or mugged every night."
College Junior,2,"Greeks are not a very big deal here at SU because we are a smaller school, and they do not have as much of a presence. They also do not have sorority and fraternity houses or chapter houses. Also, because the houses are all off campus here at Salisbury, and no roads run through campus with houses on them, all the parties are pretty far away and have to be driven to and drinking and driving do not mix. The parties are therefore not a big deal. The one annoying thing is that although greek life is not a big deal here, the greeks still act like it is especially Phi Mu and Sig Tau."
College Sophomore,2,They are small. Maintenance never came to fix things such as shower. 10 girls had to share one shower for over a month. Bathroom only got cleaned 1 time a week. And no social atmosphere
College Sophomore,2,It's all fast food. No student discounts at all
College Junior,2,"The local atmosphere that surround Salisbury University involves a lot of crime and violence. The class of people living in the area is significantly lower than many other areas I have seen and the locals are not the fondest of the college students. Although there are some pretty cool places to go such as Riverside, Brew, or the Salisbury Zoo there is not much to do once leaving campus. One very big positive however is the food. There are tons of places to eat within walking distance of the university!"
College Sophomore,2,"As an incoming Freshman, you are automatically applied for scholarships at the school which is fantastic. The problem is, if that scholarship no longer applies to you for any reason, you cannot reapply for other scholarships. I applied to the school as an Early Childhood Education major because, honestly, I had no idea what I was doing. As soon as I was accepted, I switched to an Undecided major, but they already matched me with a scholarship specifically for Education majors. They gave it to me for my freshman year, but now I am a psychology major and they have to take away the scholarship. I am an excellent student with a 4.0 gpa  but there's no way to reapply for scholarships. I intend to call the financial aid office to see if there's anything they can do for me but I'm not expecting fantastic results."
College Sophomore,2,"Salisbury is really known for its house parties because that is all there really is.  It is actually kind of sad because the weekends have a set sequence as to where everybody over 21 is.  For example Thursday night is Brew River, Friday night is Monkey Barrel, and Saturday night is house parties.  The aforementioned places, Brew and Barrel are really the only bar/club scene.  The underage nightlife revolves around house parties which get busted a lot because the cops in the area seem they have nothing better to do.  Transportation on the other hand is great.  It is called Safe Ride and it does not matter your age, they will come pick up and take you home with no questions asked."
College Junior,2,"It's too strict. I can understand the need to protect the students but it's so strict, the parties on campus are non-existent and if you want to party you're stuck between venturing off campus into a sketchy area."
College Senior,2,"I wish it wasn't like this, but unless you are someone who plays a varsity sport, or you're dating someone who plays a varsity sport, no one really goes to games or pays any attention to them. Intramural sports people can get into sometimes, but usually only because they are with a group of friends, usually greek life. School spirit is lacking."
College Freshman,2,While the health center is great I don't always feel safe on campus. There are gangs outside of campus and criminal activity. Almost every night I can hear sirens going up and down the street. I also don't like how the campus is open. I would feel safer if there was more security getting into buildings or feeling more enclosed from the outside world.
College Freshman,2,I don't feel safe walking around the city outside my campus. There are many issues and the people are not friendly. There are not many places to go and the places that students do go are not very exciting. The mall is small and has little shops to go to. The town is not modern whatsoever. Many buildings are dilapidated and boarded up. The food is decent but there are hardly any interesting attractions that people would want to visit.
College Freshman,2,I did not recieve any scholarships or work study. The scholarships are very specific and cater to small number of students. Work study is scarce and had to recieve.
College Freshman,2,"I'm transferring to Towson or UMD, everyone here seems to be going nowhere particularly special."
College Freshman,2,We live in the middle of a high crime city. Never walk by yourself at night.
College Freshman,2,If you don't have a car its hard to go anywhere during the day
College Freshman,2,Our Football team sucks and no one really pays attention to anything else except for lacrosse. Some years our lacrosse team is good other years it is not. I would highly recommend doing intramural sports they're really fun and people actually go to see them.
College Freshman,2,"There's only fast food places that are close to campus. If you want to get something decent to eat you have to have a car and even the decent places aren't really that good, it's mostly sport bars."
Recent Alumnus,2,"crowded labs, slow connection, wireless is crap"
Recent Alumnus,2,Lived with parents but know most housing expensive
College Freshman,2,There should be more opportunities for students
College Freshman,2,There aren't many things for students to take part in or do locally
College Senior,2,My specific major is ok but not one I would recommend.  Most of the students enrolled in it are graduating late because of scheduling issues within the program.  They're are little to no opportunities offered to the students in the programs including internships or extracurricular clubs.
College Senior,2,The local community is very negative towards the college students and the community is dangerous for the students to be in and around
College Senior,2,Not enough parking spots to accommodate the number of students who currently attend
College Senior,2,I am very disappointed in my school and do not enjoy it at all.  
College Senior,2,Students are attacked at least once a week
College Freshman,2,Not much of a greek life.
College Sophomore,2,It seems so hard to get scholarships these days. I received no scholarships from school. Most of my financial aid came from grants and loans.
College Sophomore,2,"There really isn't too much diversity here, to be honest. There don't seem to be many international students, students of varying ethnic background, or students of religious backgrounds that differ from Christianity. And it's very obvious that the campus is predominately white. But everyone seems relatively accepting of others."
College Junior,2,"I definitely made a mistake coming here.
I need diversity and you're not going to find that here. The academics are great but that's such a small part of your college experience. If you're from the city or a suburb close to a city, I wouldn't recommend coming here. It's culture shock."
College Junior,2,"Im not involved or interested in Greek life for personal reasons but in my opinion it is over priced and over rated, no houses either making it difficult to have parties"
College Freshman,2,"I applied for the FAFSA and did not get any financial aid or scholarships through Salisbury, even though I was a great student in high school"
College Junior,2,There's a huge variety of fast food restaurants if you're into that...
College Sophomore,2,Living on campus is fun as a freshmen because you meet a lot of new people and you experience the college life. After your freshmen year you want more privacy but upperclassmen housing is expensive. It would be cheaper to live off campus after your first year.
College Sophomore,2,"Our Greek life isn't a big part of our campus. They hold events but they aren't seen as the ""popular"" people."
College Sophomore,2,There is a heavy workload if you take on any science major but it is not impossible to do well and there are some teachers that make the subject interesting and make your life easier with less workload. 
College Sophomore,2,The food here is a lot better than at other universities and there are many options. The food taste a little bland sometimes. 
College Sophomore,2,"There are usually parties every weekend but if you are from a fun and urban city like I am, you might find the parties here to be boring. "
Alum,1,"Made me hate my research field and my view on ""education"". Teachers don't care about you or your learning experience. Students are ignorant and racist.  The area is sketchy and unsafe."
Freshman,1,"Salisbury sucks.  The people are bitchy, there is never anything going on on campus, clubs are hard to find and join, the commons has the worst dining hours possible (read: closes as early as 7:30pm, and doesn’t open for breakfast until 9:30 on the weekends), the campus is dead on the weekends. If you don’t Ike to party there is nothing to do here. If you don’t have a car, you’re screwed because there is no public transportation out here. The only redeeming quality is the teachers are alright."
Senior,1,"If you trying to get a Computer Science degree. My advise, go find another school because mostly all the professors are ridiculous. They honestly don't know how to teach, and they are extremely hard. Most of them have bad reviews on ratemyprof.com. Funny thing that they let people cheat during a exams, and professor don't care about it even the Dean of the apartment don't care. There are people graduated with a Computer Science degree by cheating there way through. I was a student in Salisbury University. I had one year to graduate, and I realized most every Computer Science classes people cheat in class by looking up the answers on their phone during a exam, and people giving out codes to other people. If you report them. The professors don't care.  People who on the dean-list cheat their way through on that list. Some of the tutors don't know how to code.  So, I don't need to been a school filled with cheaters. Sorry, that is the ugly truth."
College Junior,1,For university park it was my only option. it was too expensive and i was bullied out of my own appertment to the point where i moved out.
College Senior,1,"Salisbury university tries to cover this up but the amount of violence near campus is actually scary. There are emails week after week about armed robberies, bomb threats, assaults on campus, etc. You really have to be careful about where you choose to live when moving off campus and where you are after dark. SU police does a crappy job of letting you know when something immediately dangerous is happening near campus."
College Freshman,1,Nightlife here sucks. The house parties here are the same as back at home. There are only two bars. Getting to and from the parties that are far away is such a hassle that sometimes it's not even worth going out
College Junior,1,"I grew up in Montgomery County. Coming from that area, you're used to having a lot to do. DC is ten minutes away from where I live and I'm never bored.
This is definitely a small town."
College Senior,1,Financial Aid is the worst there
College Senior,1,Finding a parking spot is nearly impossible
College Freshman,1,"I am not aware of any ""Greek"" life at my school, so I really don't know how to rate it."
College Sophomore,1,"Public transportation is so unreliable. The university fails to realize that there are students that come from urban cities that have organized forms of public transportation. Buses come late, transportation to the mall is only on Saturdays and bus times are unpredictable. The university shuttle is a little more reliable but it only goes around the campus. We only have one shuttle bus and one public bus. "
College Sophomore,1,Salisbury is a poor city and there are robberies that occur near campus. The campus doesn't seem to take these robberies very seriously because students only receive plain emails about them with little detail. There are never any lock downs on campus when something dangerous (like a shooting) occurs nearby and that is a serious issue here.
College Freshman,1,The financial aid office isn't very helpful. I called trying to get options for other funding and they didn't have a lot of choices.
College Sophomore,1,I always asked Professors and no one knew how to even apply for scholarships
College Sophomore,1,"I receive no financial aid, and there doesn't seem to be many opportunities to obtain it especially for out of state students."
Recent Alumnus,1,Its been a while since I graduated and parking what always a source of contention with students.  I've heard its much better now.
College Freshman,1,"It can be very difficult to attend classes when your professors do not check attendance, and this can easily reflect on your grades. The course load is fair, it is finding the motivation to do them."
College Senior,1,Do not rely on public transportation at Salisbury University because it will constantly fail to meet your needs. Most students I know have a car because it's just hard to get around there without a car especially if you have to work off-campus. I had to go get my car too after my first semester there.
College Freshman,1,"The Frat and Sorority involvement here is straight up junior varsity. There are technically no frat houses aloud, but this doesn't stop the Greek students here to lease s****y houses and call them a Frat house."
College Senior,1,"Drug Usage – A lot of student's make use of drugs in this university, especially alcohol beverages and cigarettes. I don't know if it's caused because of school stress or so but beware of this before going."

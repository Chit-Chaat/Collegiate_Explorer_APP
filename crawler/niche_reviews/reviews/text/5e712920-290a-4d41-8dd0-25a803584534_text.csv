Sophomore,5,They help you with your classes & financial aid if you having the biggest trouble with each of those things.
Sophomore,5,All the professors are really doing their best to get us on the right track of learning through thee bad times we're having & it's been a good help for us because it's showing us that we can still get our degree behind a computer.
Junior,5,"i'm currently enrolled in Dental Hygiene program at West Los Angeles College. All I can say is that even through the pandemic, the faculty members and all the professor are very professional, helpful and understanding. They guide us every step of the way. I couldn't be more excited."
Junior,5,"I'm not a big fan of online schooling, but all of the professor make it so much easier to understand and follow up with assignments. I think I slowly start to enjoy it."
Sophomore,5,The atmosphere at West La college was amazing. Everyone truly cares about you and it is amazing. They have a full on learning center there and everyone had been so helpful. All you need to do is show that you care and you want to be  apart of your learning.
Sophomore,5,The online learning experience was amazing. I learned a lot in these online courses. More than I thought I would. I took a total of five online courses within the two years I was at West Los Angeles College.
Sophomore,5,"my online experience has been wonderful, the classes are well organized on canvas and everything is there when I need specific material. West la has been nothing but great to me, especially being a full time student athlete. Chase you dreams and never stop!"
Sophomore,5,"I like how everyone is friendly, the professors talk and make an effort to bond with students in my opinion and overall good vibes."
Freshman,5,"Online classes where my downfall really, but history online? SUPER FUN. It was always a great class. English exams kicked my but teachers were still very helpful"
Freshman,5,"The school as a whole is so beautiful, the teachers truly want you to succeed. It definitely was hard but use your resources! My favorite experience was my Chemistry class. Which was from 5-9:50 and he let us go everyday 50 minutes early, he answered emails on weekends, my english teacher helped me through a lot as well! Overall west la is a great school with very helpful staffing!"
Alum,5,"Personally, I really enjoy online classes. In general, i find online classes helpful, as i usually work and need a more flexible class schedule. West LA used Canvas for their online classes, a very user-friendly and clean-looking system. For most of the classes I took, the professors were easy to get a hold of and communicate with. 10/10 Highly recommend!"
Freshman,5,"Even though I have yet to begin my online classes in August, their communication towards all my questions has been great and very helpful!"
Freshman,5,I am about to begin my first semester at West Los Angeles College and am very excited to continue my education an work hard towards my Bachelors Degree!
Alum,5,"While attending WLAC, most of the courses I took were online because I worked full time and didn’t have the availability to attend college on campus while working. The teachers online were very resourceful, they would offer tutoring during certain hours, most were punctual on returning emails, and you could always have a discussion with your other fellow peers if you weren’t picking up material or just needed help. Online was just awesome for me. One thing that could be useful is have one on one zoom meetings for mathematics and YouTube links attached to modules in case a student still doesn’t understand the context."
Alum,5,What I liked most about this school was the amount of diversity that we were able to experience. That we could learn about different cultures along with obtaining our education. The sportsmanship was like no other because it always felt family orientated. One thing I’d like to we could change is having cal state/ university colleges come to campus to educate kids on programs they offer.
Junior,5,Being at west la I found out that being antisocial is not good we must communicate at all times .They do help you out to find your classes for your major.All careers that you are trying to pursue you have to have English and math.I learned to utilize the professors office hours and do not wait until the last minute to study . Create study groups and take good notes .Study everyday and then do a reflection paper or something it will help. It is a nice area to go to school in .Obtain at least a C average .
Sophomore,5,I loved being involved with the Student Organization and planning events on campus. I also joined the honors program which made it easier to get into all the UC schools.
Sophomore,5,Great experience! Got into UCLA by transferring from here. I was able to take all my generals  and join the honors program which helped me get into all the UC’s. So thankful for West and all the awesome counselors and professors.
Senior,5,I am student in West Los Angeles College since 2015 and I was working there as a work study.I had really great experience. Campus  is such a safe and great environment and professors are the best of the best in county.
Senior,5,"Online courses is so organized and easy understanding for students. Instructors really care about their student and whenever a student needs help, they are there for her/him. I have nothing to complain about online courses that I have been taking in West Los Angeles College, and if I could take the time back, I would still take my courses there. Of one my classes was in campus and due to the Covid_19 it turned to online, and I could not be more happier with that. I was thinking that I cannot understand the concepts since it was a math class, but interaction between the professor and students and students together were even more than we were at the class. Students and professor are keep in touch through the email and I am feeling lime whenever I need help, somebody is there to help me, it could be either instructor or my classmates. I could not take a course for fall semester due to the amount that I had to pay but they allowed me to take it and gave me more time to pay and I impressed"
Graduate Student,5,Professors make online courses simple and straightforward. They are very understanding and helpful with any concerns or questions.
Graduate Student,5,"I loved WLAC! It was the by far the best experience. I’ve taken courses at other local colleges but they don’t compare to WLA. The professors and councelers are organized, attentive, and exceed expectations. The campus is quiet and students are friendly."
Sophomore,5,"I've been to three other campuses within the LACCD, and this has got to be my favorite. Not only is it clean and the ambiance is amazing, but the people who work here. I've yet to run into a professor I didn't like or who wasn't helpful. And their are so many programs on campus that want to help you succeed. And it seems like they all will go above and beyond just to make sure you have all that need and get all that you need."
Sophomore,5,"I am doing online school and it is very flexible, I get to work and study at the same time. And also the school has been giving me scholarships to help me achieve my goals!"
Niche User,5,"The school is small, but should not be underestimated. It offers scholarships, activities, and affordable classes. School staff is friendly, and can help you find what you need.  Although food and dorming is limited within, the surrounding area can compensate. It is filled with job opportunities, tutoring services, school events and apartments ready to be filled. The school is small, and it is easy to make friends there if one is willing to open themselves to the campus. The staff members and administrators understand the struggles of the students, not to be put lightly mind you, and will do anything they can to help. For students who came out of college or adults trying to get back into education, this school is willing to help with whatever obstacles you have."
Sophomore,5,My favorite part of West La college is how easy it is for students to enroll in classes. I have no trouble finding my classes and enrolling in them before they got too full. My friends in other colleges always have trouble getting their classes and I always reccomend that they come to WLAC to get it. The professors that I took were all amazing. They truly cared about their students success and it showed.
Senior,5,West Los Angeles college has a very nice campus and a lot of services for students. I love that they offer a Bachelor Degree in Dental Hygiene.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy attending WLAC.  It is a beautiful campus and most of the professors are nice and helpful. If you apply and can become a member of TRIO SSS you will have access to one-on=one tutoring, computers/ printers, and academic counseling.  It the best program at West!"
Sophomore,5,West is a great school. The only thing I would recommend is getting an ADN program for student. I am a nursing major and I wish I could stay at this campus because I absolutely love it here.
Alum,5,WEST LA IS A GREAT CAMPUS TO BE ON AND A EVEN BETTER STUDENT AND FACULTY. COMMUTING THERE IS EASY BECAUSE OF THE MANY BUS ROUTES. THE CURRICULUM IS EXCEPTIONAL AND LEAVES YOU WELL PREPARED. FACILITIES ARE JUST AS GREAT AND THERE IS STILL MORE TO BE MADE SO ITS STILL GETTING BETTER.
Sophomore,5,Modern buildings and friendly staff.  The campus has a lot of diversity within the students attending and a strong sense of community is felt. Ive had some great and average professors. Most are very knowledgeable in their field but it doesn't always translate into their teaching.
Freshman,5,"I am a High School graduate I decided to choose West Los Angeles College because of their Aviation Associates in Science. I decided to attend this College because it is close to my home and I heard that this college can open up so much opportunities for me. I have not, yet taken a class, but I have heard a lot of good things about this college. My goal is to transfer to CSULA or CSULB either or is fine with me. I believe that this college can be the start of something new."

Most of my classes were very interesting where I actually enjoyed taking them and I met a lot of great people. It was a great choice for me to save money from being hit with high tuition going straight to a four year university first. I am very pleased with my experience at West LA."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently finishing up my second year at West Los Angeles College. It has been a great experience for me. This school has allowed me to adjust more smoothly to college life and has provided me with a fulfilling learning experience. I've had some really good and knowledgeable instructors, I've had very accommodating schedules even still while taking full-time courses, and I am appreciative at the opportunity to have attended a good community college to prepare me for my transition to a four year university."
Sophomore,5,The over all atmosphere of West Los Angeles College is welcoming and friendly! The staff and counselors do everything in their power to make sure they help the students achieve their goals the best they possibly can.
Sophomore,5,West Los Angeles college is a great school if your looking for a community college to attend . Private campus helpful students and staff
Junior,5,"I like how the school is well taken care of and the staff members at admissions, bookstore, and business department are really friendly."
Alum,5,"When looking for whatever classes I need to take, I always check to see if it is available at WLAC first because it is conveniently located with consistently reliable parking and excellent instructors. All the other students that I have talked to at West agree that WLAC is an excellent school. Every teacher that I have had here has been outstanding in the variety of subjects from sociology, chemistry, psychology, biology, math, statistics, and throughout the dental hygiene program. I have found that they truly want to help the students to succeed and move forward in their lives on toward their educational goals for their overall life enhancement. The campus police are friendly and professional. Go West, Go Far!"

The professors are very competent and passionate about the field they teach. The library of the college is highly open for students seeking for help with their homeworks, and those who need tutors at no cost. Additionally, plenty of books and computers are available to facilitate the learning process. The overall college has a nice environment. I highly recommend those seeking for a great quality of education to study at WLAC."
Freshman,5,I like that its small campus that cheap and offers alot of programs. They also have a programs one for instance is called yearup.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE this college! I started taking classes here while I was in high school and I immediately knew that I would like it. Then I got out of high school and became a full time student at West and I was a little nervous because I thought it wouldn't be the same but I really love the vibe here, the professors, the students, just everything!"
Junior,5,"My experience at West Los Angeles College has been phenomenal. Since my start at West in 2015, it has been a tremendous journey. First of all, I was fearful during my first few days because I did not know how different or difficult the transition from high school to college would be. However, what has made my experience a whole lot better and what has allowed me to gain confidence is my older brother. Overall, my experience at West Los Angeles College has been great and will continue to be awesome"
Sophomore,5,"West La college is a great school. the professors are all great one of my professors taught me that college is hard but just because it is; don't simply give up, just slow down. Many people struggle through college and then ends up breaking down because it's too much. Not everybody can handle that kind of stress and it's ok if you take longer than others, simply slow down and adjust."
Niche User,5,"Diversity and cultural differences, motivating educators,motivating career councelors, spacious rooms and a beautiful scenery!"
Sophomore,5,West Los Angeles is a great school. The staff is very helpful if you're in need. They do their best to make sure you have a smooth school year and provide great programs for those who are in need! I recommend West LA to those who are seeking a community college that will make sure you get to the next level. 
College Senior,5,The online courses are very manageable. They allow for people who have busy schedules to complete their degrees faster. The variety of courses offered online is great.
College Freshman,5,Online classes are very good for busy people that can't always make it to the school for class like myself because I am a mother.
College Freshman,5,"So far so good, but since moving to CA from TX my fees for school are super high."
College Freshman,5,"Learning new things in the world for me to start my career and my passion, you get to learn more to help the children in the future."
College Freshman,5,I didn't know much about how to sign up for school and just really how to go about. But I had a awesome counselor that sat with me for as long as I needed to explain everything to me and get me started with school.
College Junior,5,Online classes have been very helpful. It is a lot of workload but its manageable. I was able to gain some time management skills taking online classes. I have learned to be more efficient on my school work because of these online classes that I have took. It is hard to really build a relationship with your teacher because its just online but they are there to answer any questions you need. Peer-to-peer interaction is easy it allow you too communicate with one another in a chat section.
College Junior,5,The counseling office is a great place to go to get further information. They are vary helpful in directing students the right way.
Alum,4,"West Los Angeles was a great undergraduate college. The campus was close to my house and there was not a lot of traffic. We had a great variety of classes and teachers, so each student could find a class that was a good fit for them. We had options for campus, hybrid, and online classes which was helpful for anyone working or anyone needing a flexible schedule. The campus and buildings were updated and clean and we had plenty of parking space. Additionally, the student population was very diverse and inclusive. West LA is a fantastic school and I highly recommend it!"
Junior,4,Online courses can be difficult because you will have to be online a lot and some people can have poor WiFi connection. My first two years there it was good it was a little hard. I am currently going to take online classes I’m retaking some classes so yes online it’s okay .
Junior,4,"Online has been difficult, especially with math classes, but for the most part other online classes are easy and fun to take."
Sophomore,4,"Just alright, some professors really don't know what they're doing with canvas and need to be educated."
Freshman,4,"West Los Angeles College has a very welcoming and helpful environment.  All professors that I've met have been happy to assist me in any way I need to get through the course with a passing grade.  I also love that they have online classes, so I don't have to spend all my time driving to and from campus.  I had a few problems with the financial aid department, but all the problems got figured out and I have my scholarship!"
Freshman,4,Overall the college is good but it has disadvantages like some of the teachers I don't feel enjoy their job. I've only been at the school for a year but my experience still has been enough to know what to expect. The pathways are great at West la college and I believe that they can potentially lead to great futures.
Niche User,4,"West Los Angeles College has given me the opportunity as a high school student to take classes for free, an opportunity that I really have appreciated."
Freshman,4,"West Los Angeles Collega Have A Nice, Helful Staff That Are Willing To Help You On Campus And Are Able To Get Stuff Done When You Need Help."
Sophomore,4,"My experience in west la college is pretty good. Classes are really easy all you need to do is focus. They should keep halal chicken sandwiches for muslim students and help students create a men soccer team, give some funds to student so they can build a good men soccer team. these are the only thing I want them to change."
Sophomore,4,I really feel safe around campus and the classrooms are very assessable. The class sizes are reasonable and the professors are knowledgeable and approachable.
Sophomore,4,"The professors so far have been awesome. Mostly thanks to the site “ratemyprofessor.com” which helps to either WARN me not to take a class with a certain professor or PREPARE me for an awesome semester with a certain professor! My freshman year was definitely awesome! Hopefully, sophomore year is just as great or better!"
Sophomore,4,My experience with West was fine but it has to improve on subjects and more tutors to help students.
Freshman,4,West Los Angeles Community college is a great school for passing through. You can attend while working part-time but it's difficult to have a full on college experience here. It's just not that type of school. It really just depends on what you’re looking for. This school is great for catching a quick class or when Santa Monica college is all full. I would recommend going to Santa Monica College for a fuller college experience if that’s what you’re looking for. I’m attending this winter and look forward to the clubs and other college extra curricular activities that west lacks.
Sophomore,4,At West Los Angeles College you will get a ton of support from staff and counselors. Since it is a smaller school I feel like there is more one-on-one attention. I sincerely feel like WLAC cares about me and my success.
Sophomore,4,West LA had a pretty nice campus and the professors do a great job teaching students the right way and helping them understand. I would recommend that the student stores lower prices on food and snacks there.
Freshman,4,"I like West Los Angeles College because of the range of classes that they offer.  However, I wish that they could put more money into the Arts program, specifically the music program.  We have average equipment and I would like to see us have higher quality and more equipment for us to use, for example, in the school recording studio."
Sophomore,4,"Great place to start your college education.  Classes are fairly easy to get, campus is clean and quiet."
Sophomore,4,"WLAC has been an incredibly helpful school, the classes are rarely full and tuition is affordable. The school's location makes it a safe place and it's been a pleasure to attend."
Freshman,4,I joined the Athletics Program as a Freshman in the soccer team. I like how there is a counselor specifically for the athletic department and the school provides various programs for students with various backgrounds. The school is welcoming and my first quarter semester as a freshman was a good experience.
Freshman,4,"I like the campuses it set up very nicely ,it is easy to get around even for students with handicap, many parking structure, class room new and clean and driving on hill side make you feel you are going for hike, campuses police usually driving around campuses and make you feel safe."
Sophomore,4,West Los Angeles is a great community college. The professors and staff are very nice and the campus is always very clean and inviting .

Freshman,4,My experience with West Los Angeles College has been a good one. The staff is always willing to help when ever you have questions or concerns. I really enjoy my time on campus because there are people from different backgrounds that you get to meet and connect with
Sophomore,4,my experience with west la college was decent wasn't bad but then again it was as good as i would expect it to but it was nothing that i wouldn't be able to deal with.
Junior,4,The professors are extremely helpful and experienced. They teach in a way that is extremely informative and will help you retain the information instead of just memorizing and forgetting the material in the next couple of days. This is an awesome school to transfer from and will not regret attending West Los Angeles College. The only con is not providing an nursing and program.
Sophomore,4,I like the earthie and modern combination West LA has. Also how the counselors that really want to help are very helpful and try to keep you on the right path. This past year has really helped me in deciding my major and getting ahead.
College Sophomore,4,I do not talk much with other students. they seem nice
College Sophomore,4,I like the variety of different classes.
College Sophomore,4,It is easy to get started. I see lots of fun and different classes to try.
College Sophomore,4,It was easy to apply and fast to get started. The school is also flexible and I can still work if I need to.
College Senior,4,There are many courses available at different times which provide a flexible schedule.
College Senior,4,Online courses are interactive and include class discussions. Online courses are easier and more flexible.
College Senior,4,There are many programs and scholarship opportunities for certain majors.
College Senior,4,Professors are great and engaging. There should be more resources and tutors for higher level classes.
College Senior,4,I have met many caring proffesors. The chair of the science department has been such a help to me. The proffesors really do want to help students out.
College Senior,4,There are many programs available to low income students! I have been awarded several vouchers to help pay for required books.
College Senior,4,I have learned so much while attending this school. The STEM teachers are brilliant.
Recent Alumnus,4,"No problems whatsoever transferring units. The Admissions office faculty are excellent, they were very friendly and answered of my questions."
Recent Alumnus,4,"All the online classes are run through Etudes. This website is used for all access to student's online courses. The website is the easiest website to use, as it provides all the necessary information for a student to succeed in online classes. Also, the discussion center is simple to use, and if you have any questions to professors, then you can send them an email through etudes, which they usually instantaneously receive. Communication is fun using Etudes."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Nothing but the best, for the best! Teachers are excellent. Do your research first, then choose wisely. Math teachers at this institution are awesome, and they're very helpful. Be on top of your work, and you'll earn their respect. 

The class experience is a okay. It really is what you make it. The class sizes aren't bad at all, and they are never full, unless you're taking a math class. Math classes and Science classes are always the ones that have a 'lot of students always at this institution."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The teachers at this school are great, they really want their students to go to the next level. My major is Business Administration with an emphasis in finance, and the teachers at this institution provided me with great experiences for the University level. I remember this one time, my Calculus 1 teacher stayed an extra hour after class just to teach three remaining students the topic in the notes because we had a hard time understanding it. 

No complaints about the workload because it's college, and for this college the workload was very fair compared to other institutions. The faculty and counselors are very. helpful and very caring. If you show them that you're willing work hard for them, they'll also work hard for you."
Recent Alumnus,4,"West Los Angeles college is a hidden gen, honestly. Lot's of people say that Santa Monica Community is the greatest community college in Los Angeles, but I hate to burst their bubbles of opinions, when I care to disagree. WLAC is great for many reasons, and those reasons are: 1) The price and experience you'll receive at this institution is excellent, 

2) Classes and campus are rarely full, and 3) The parking pass is very affordable and there's always parking available at West.  Also, all the teachers at I'd attended at this school were great, especially the math department. They really care about the student, and will provide the help you need if they see you want to progress and have the ambition to proceed to the next level.  Thank you, West. You are truly a hidden gem of the community college in Los Angeles."
College Sophomore,4,M y stay in school has been ok. The classes are flexible and the schedule accommodative.
College Sophomore,4,I have not taken online courses
College Sophomore,4,The career services are nice. They offer interesting options for students.The alumni network is great and help student to network and interact with one another. The job prospect is great. Students form west have a high chance of getting a job when they leave collage.
College Sophomore,4,"My professors have been awesome. They are very helpful and go out of their way to make sure students succeed in their class. The courses are nice and interesting, and offer very interesting topics. Classes are normal, and the class size are not too large to distract, and not too small to be boring."
College Sophomore,4,"I am studying for a Political Science degree, in order to apply for law later. My degree is transferable to either UCLA, or USC. I believe that I am in the right course towards achieving my goal of becoming an attorney. My major will give me a solid foundation and help me to move onto my next field of study without a lot of difficulties."
College Sophomore,4,"It has been interesting for me concerning my measure- Political Science - which is a course I like a lot. This is more so, considering the political atmosphere in the country right now. My instructor is also an expert in his field, so class is always interesting and entertaining--I always look forward to lectures, which is something indeed!"
College Sophomore,4,"It has been an interesting journey for me so far at West Los Angeles Collage. It is a school that I have grown fond off. There are lots of engaging and helpful people at West Collage. They are always warm and friendly, though you will find they can be tough and business like when the situation calls for it. I especially like the counseling department. They have made my stay in school a lot easier, and gone out off their way to make sure I have, and can access all resources that should be of help to me while am at West. My counselor has been exceptionally helpful to me. The only problem I have with my school terms from their lack of scholarship for students."
College Senior,4,"even if there was questions, the teacher is very helpful."
College Senior,4,the teachers are amazing and can point you to the right direction.
College Senior,4,The only problem; like any college or university is the fees and money situations with books and fees for classes or parking passes. especially with out scholarships.
College Senior,4,"The classes have scheduled tutoring and if you don't understand something, the student are extremely helpful also"
College Senior,4,"There will always be help. Even other students are extremely helpful and friendly, the campus is beautiful"
College Student,4,Faulty and administrators are dedicated to students' success.
College Freshman,4,The Career Prospects are great! Mentors are always there to help you and give you advice and head you into the right path.
College Freshman,4,"The class buildings are so easy to find since they have the building name next to it which makes classes easy to find. The cafe is always in and out business which is the only down part, there is a taco truck food there is great I personally loved the asada fries and asada burrito. The library is such a great resource i love the library so much probably my favorite place in the school."
College Senior,4,My experience at West LA is great.
College Senior,4,The teachers do a good job organizing the class.
College Senior,4,West LA has different centers for career and jobs.
Freshman,2,"Someone can tell there is corrupted management by looking at the old computers and broken, dirty chairs everywhere. A lot of things in the facility are either old or damaged. The neighbor, Santa Monica College, is much better in many ways. This place looks like forgotten."
Junior,2,"Majority of my professors have been extremely helpful with my success in their classes, always being available for office hours to answer questions and taking time to clarify any material from lecture has been very beneficial. All of the workshops and presentations I have ever been to on campus were very useful for several areas of life that I can take with me and use for years to come.  However, there has often been a shortage of staff in the student services building, making processing times for important documentation exceedingly long and getting an appointment for general advising nearly impossible. I have had to retake multiple tests as a disabilities student because they were never delivered back to my professor. Nevertheless I have recently joined the Trio SSS program where I look forward to getting plenty of help and advising to be able to transfer next fall. Although my experience in the classroom has been decent, the student support outside the class has not been as great."
College Senior,2,Faculty does not answer their phones or return phone calls. Trying to get an appointment with a college counselor was difficult. Trying to get scholarships are very difficult since their website doesn't work which is the only way to apply.
College Senior,2,"Registration process is pretty straight forward, just add it through the student information system. Some online professors don't seem to care. I tried to add a class within the first week of class and she wouldn't allow me too. If there's an online class that is only half a semester, beware. The workload will be way too much with extremely time consuming assignments. They make you buy the most expensive newest edition book there is every year and rely everything on you reading the entire text book."
College Senior,2,The career center recommends you do job searches through monster.com and indeed.com which is great but the school itself doesn't really offer jobs through their resources. How do we keep in contact with the alumni network?
College Senior,2,"What employer recruiting on campus? Unfortunately, to my knowledge, there isn't any. I also don't even think there is a career center that helps students find jobs. There's not much of a way to be in contact with the alumni network. The degree pretty much is only as good as how you apply yourself. It's also good if you're transferring. This school does have great potential."
College Senior,2,"The Good - 

Affordable tuition, Safe, beautiful campus with plenty of parking, some great teachers, descent, manageable work load.

The Bad

Admin/Faculty/Financial Aid never answers phone calls or returns messages. No scholarship department or even access to scholarships. A lot of staff and policies made only care about their own interests, not the students. Students don't apply themselves here that much. Cafe was shut down numerous times so we only have access to one on campus food truck. Required classes in the same major are scheduled to over lap each other each semester."
Recent Alumnus,2,One shouldn't expect the job market to open up with a degree from this institution. It's more of a stepping stone to something better.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There were many great professors and classes that I missed out on due to the lack of availability of classes for many courses. Many times having a really great professor means taking a daytime class. Whenever I took an evening cla as, the class sucked."
Recent Alumnus,2,I feel like I was rushed through my studies for my psych major. It felt like it was based less on comprehension and more so on memorization and regurgitation.
College Freshman,2,"Class with Mr.F is horrible. He hardly would teach, he wouldn't explain the material step by step, would show his youtube videos instead. Never used the book as he said. He would promote his own book instead. Class was always not interested by the middle of semester people just stopped showing up. It was his way or no way on how to show our answers thats why half the people failed test."
College Senior,2,"I didn't had a good experience with post-grad services. I had the feeling to disturb every person I was talking to, it was always about time, taking another appointment, lunch break, but never about my future and what I really wanted to do. A few were really rude too and I felt really bad after that."
College Junior,2,there's not a lot of options when it comes to picking classes according to schedule. Only one class option for a particular subject per semester
College Sophomore,2,Just having more people to help us out
College Sophomore,2,havent seen any hands on work
Recent Alumnus,2,It is very difficult when you have gone to multiple schools.
College Senior,2,I have to appeal every semester even though I have a 3.9 GPA. Its pretty ridiculous.
Recent Alumnus,2,There are not enough classes offered per semester for my major therefor it takes significantly longer to complete the required courses for my major because I cannot take multiple courses at a time I have to wait until they are offered the following semesters
College Junior,2,"I have to unfortunately quit my job to go back to school. My work schedule is Monday-Friday 8am-5pm. My classes are Monday-Friday 8am-5pm. However, I have to make sacrifices in order to major in my dream career and it will be all worth it in the end."
Recent Alumnus,2,I would never go here again because of the schools atmosphere. Students count and they suck. It never felt like a community. It always seemed I was getting judged for what I was wearing or other things of the such.
Niche User,1,This school lost my Supplemental K-12 form and didn't let me know until the Saturday before classes started. This form must be signed by a school counselor so I had to come in on pupil free day and hope that my counselor was there. Thanks a lot West La!
Sophomore,1,"I was told by the Director of the Transfer Honors Program that when she received application emails, there were so many that she didn't look at any of them and she deleted ALL of them.
I tried to join the STEM Program for 5 months, and the director did not answer any of my emails for months and I wrote a letter and slipped it under his office door. I STILL heard nothing. STEM IS NOT RUNNING RIGHT NOW BTW.
Financial Aid never answers their phones. I wasn't getting my check, because none of my tax info was reviewed FOR TWO MONTHS.
The CNA program didn't prepare you for the State Exam. Most of the time we sat around watching them do tasks incorrectly. The coordinator of the program was so rude, too. About 1/2 the students failed.
There's only 12 clubs. No clubs ever respond to their emails. You have to sign up at club rush or can never join. 
The counselors don't do their job. They will all tell you false information.
THE TEACHERS ARE SO BAD AND I'M IN A HARASSMENT CASE WITH 1 OF THEM."
College Freshman,1,The process at west la was a pain. since i started college back in fall 2011 never received a penny until a week ago.they kept telling i was not eligible for financial aid . i kept going every week and they would ask for a new papers i would take it and they always said i had everything just to wait.i never received any money because they never scanned the IRS forms i took multiple times to them.it took 2 years for me to receive financial aid and i received it after my semester was over.
College Sophomore,1,"The only way to talk to anyone in financial aid was to go to the office and wait for long periods of time for your number to be called. Each time I went with a question, I had to return to ask again at least twice. The younger employees also gave me wrong information. It is unorganized and not helpful at all. The older employees do not seem to care to help in any way. I feel like I am bothering them."
College Sophomore,1,"Budget Cuts – The school is much more eager to spend funding on landscaping rather than putting it to better use by not cutting classes. From all the course-cutting, it's become quite difficult to be able to find classes that conform to my schedule."
College Senior,1,they had me run around collecting forms and signing papers all year long.
College Sophomore,1,"Very Long Process – The Tuition is not that bad but, the financial aid takes very long to be processed and many of the employees in the financial aid office are very rude and make you just not finish the paperwork at times. But they get the job done."
College Senior,1,"Liberal Arts Major – I am a liberal arts major because they did not have a major for film studies. So I had to go to the counselor and they told me to became a liberal arts major and when i transferred then I would be able to switch to a film major. After I nearly completed the workload at West La College which was 3 years later, I went to my counselor to figure out what I needed to graduate and come to find out they were just as lost as I was. I ended up realizing I took classes I didnt need and I couldn't switch my major once I transferred over. Then I went to another counselor they told me that I could.  The classes i took according my film interest were ok but I feel like I wasted 3 years of my life because people came in after me and got out before me. The counseling office and financial aid office are uncoordinated. They claim that I they have lost paper work and its been a mess. As far as the job opportunities I worked there in the Umoja program and everything was fine with that program. I helped alot of people for good pay. The only other thing was that I havn't been payed in months because they claim i havn't turned in any paperwork for my hours when I turned in the paper work myself."
College Sophomore,1,Not Good – I applied for work study and never heard from anyone.
College Sophomore,1,"Child Development Dept. Is Very Poor – The head of the Dept. is a lousy teacher who cannot even write a good syllabus using correct grammar and spelling. She yells at students for asking questions and generally creates an atmosphere not conducive to learning.

Another teacher lets students take open book tests and help each other during the test. This makes for an easy class but does not insure that the students are learning."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much to Offer – This is a very old college with sub-standard classrooms and sub-standard teachers. I'd say what sets it most apart from other colleges is the level of teachers, which are sub-standard.

The teachers can barely spell or write using correct grammar. I found it appalling. 

Another thing that is lousy is the Administration. I know there have been budget cuts, but for the Admissions Office to not answer the phone is unacceptable. I've called numerous times to ask a question and let the phone ring and ring - during normal business hours - and no one answers. Unbelievable!"

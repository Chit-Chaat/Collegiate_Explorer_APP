Junior,5,"I loved my experience with Dickinson College. The faculty is always there for students and the small class sizes means you’re usually able to explore parts of each course in more depth if you want. Opportunities to do research and work alongside professors are common, and the vibe between students and faculty is really positive."
Senior,5,"I love Dickinson. After four years, I truly feel like I have a community of friends, professors and local community members that have helped me to grow into the person that I am today."
Alum,5,"As an alumnus, I look back on my time at Dickinson as one of the very best experiences of my life.  Dickinson set me up for a successful career, allowed me to go abroad, connected me with lifelong friends, exposed me to different cultures and points-of-view, and made me a passionate and engaged student of the world."
Junior,5,"I have had a positive experience at Dickinson College thus far.  I am able to do two majors and a minor and also enjoy other aspects of Dickinson other than solely academia. I am involved in many areas of student life on campus including: sports( cross country and track and field), Greek life, peer tutoring, a job in the Advancement Office, as well as an abroad experience in Italy.  The friends and memories I have made at Dickinson have been truly phenomenal and I am excited to finish out my college experience here."
Sophomore,5,"I’m a sophomore currently and Dickinson is my home away from home. The campus is beautiful and students are friendly and hard working, and for the most part very strong students who care about their studies. I’m super happy I chose Dickinson & the financial aid package was beyond generous."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Dickinson! I got a world-class education, made lifelong friends, and had research and study abroad opportunities I could only dream of. The architecture and campus is absolutely beautiful and the landscaping and outdoor spaces and sports fields are stunning. Some of my professors became friends and all were challenging and brilliant. I really enjoyed my 4 years and am proud to be a Dickinsonian."
Alum,5,"I am a Dickinson alumni and my experience was truly life-changing. I was surrounded with caring, hard-working students and passionate professors who were leaders in their fields. The campus is one of the most beautiful in the country. I was a tennis player and really loved being part of the team. Great memories! Loved my study abroad year as well. Was employed in a great position within 3 months of graduating Magna Cum Laude. Thank you, Dickinson. I feel lucky to have been able to attend and receive great financial aid."
Sophomore,5,"Dickinson has completely changed the way I view education. This school is stellar, and I am honored to be a member of such a wonderful community."
Freshman,5,"Loving it so far - wish they would lower tuition
Lots of fun things to do on campus with friends
Pretty good food but rich people complain
Great clubs and activities
Time for napping"
Alum,5,"Loved my time at Dickinson. The academic curriculum was quite rigorous. I learned to think for myself, and to write well. I discovered in law school that few others had this type of preparation. My professors were amazing teachers, and very much cared about their students."
Sophomore,5,Dickinson is definitely worth a look. Professors are very knowledgeable and passionate.  The student body is very  intelligent.
Alum,5,"I graduated with an English major and studied abroad my juinior year. It was easily the best 4 years of my life- rigorous academics, engaged learners, fun athletics and school spirit, kids who care about the world, the best professors I could ask for.  Fun party scene but be aware of huge alcohol consumption."
Senior,5,"Loved going to school here. To the small classroom sizes to the gorgeous campus scenery all year round, it is the place to be!"
Sophomore,5,"Dickinson has allowed me to make new friends from all over the world. I am able to learn in and out of the classroom about different people and their cultures. When you go to Dickinson you have the chance to make your experience anything you want it to be. Being able to attend classes with people with life experiences that differ than your own help you grow. Growing into who you are is the most important part of college, and Dickinson helps their students you that in many ways."
Sophomore,5,"I'm only a sophomore at Dickinson but my experience has been amazing so far. In speaking to my friends who attend different universities, I can say that the sense of community on the Dickinson campus is absolutely unmatched. Faculty and administration is incredibly accessible, I have already had the pleasure of having dinner with our college president, and have taken a class with our Dean of Students. Classes are intimate, my largest class so far being around 25 students and my smallest only having 5, which facilitates close and positive faculty-student relationships. Opportunities have proven to be almost overwhelming as an underclassmen, with various work and research opportunities both during the semester and over breaks, and the school's commitment to study abroad only works to increase student opportunities on a global scale."
Junior,5,"I've loved Dickinson from the moment I stepped on campus. The landscape is well maintained, however some of the buildings could really use an update. The dorms are typical of any college, and they are adding a nice new dorm this year. There is special interest housing which is worth looking at. The class sizes are small so lots of one-on-one time with professors. The sciences are amazing even though Dickinson doesn't recognize them as much as the large population of business majors. My professors are great advisors for grad school and job options, and Dickinson has many resources for finding internships. Pretty diverse population and the food is awesome. I personally don't think this is a party school, good options for sororities but not so much fraternities. Greek life doesn't interfere with non-greek students. Carlisle is a nice town with lots to do in the surrounding area. Dickinson also provides great financial aid resources."
Niche User,5,Dickinson is a hidden gem in the East!  The classes are excellent and the professors are very knowledgeable.  The campus is small but has a TON to offer students.  It's as strong academically as any of the Little Ivies!!!!
Freshman,5,"I have meet my closest friends here and have found a supportive group of advisors to help me achieve my goals. With the help of the amazing faculty, I have formulated an achievable plan and have set out to realize my plans of traveling the world and using my liberal arts education to accomplish something I can be proud of."
Niche User,5,I loved visiting Dickinson for a diversity program this fall. All the faculty members who I met were invested in their respective disciplines and determined to pass on their enthusiasm to students. The current undergraduates were friendly and willing to talk to me about their college experiences.
Freshman,5,"I am a first year student at Dickinson and I have enjoyed my experience so far. The community is great and this was a concern for me being a person of color. However, the POC community is more than welcoming as well as the nonePOC community. Your experience here is what you make of it, if you go out and attempt to assimilate into the community you will do just fine but if you hide and stay away from people then you will not enjoy your experience. The classes are great the professor take a personal interest in your well being in class, to the point of emailing or calling you if you are absent. There are many clubs and activities to get involved in. Greek life is present but not mandatory to have a great experience at Dickinson. The party scene is great and accommodates all kind of people. From major parties to smaller kickbacks. I recommend Dickinson for anyone, it’s a great school!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Dickinson! My first year here was very satisfying all around as a student-athlete. I found the ability to balance both athletics and academics, which is crucial to all coaches and athletes. My expectations were surpassed especially with regards to campus awareness. This college is very aware of diversity and contemporary issues. Two of the main pillars of a Dickinson education--global citizenship and sustainability--are present in every major's curriculum. I've found that alum have been able to apply their skills to jobs that might not even be related to their major. This skill is more important than ever because in 5-10 years, there will be jobs and industries that do not even exist yet."
Niche User,5,"I am a current high school senior hoping to attend Dickinson in fall 2018. I toured the school twice and I fell in love with it. The professors I talked to were so helpful, all the coaches were so nice and they really cared about their student athletes. The students seemed genuinely happy to be on the campus and to tell the tours about their school."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a student at Dickinson college, which is a small liberal arts college (2500-3000).
If you are seeking close community, constant interactions with professors- this college is for you! The campus is pretty small, and the amount of people attending the college is small, so it is easy to get to know people, you won't feel lost.
The college has pretty good program in Russian, Profs of this department are very nice and are willing to help students, so if anyone wants to pursue Russian, it is a great choice!"
Freshman,5,"I am thriving at Dickinson College. Being a shy person, I now can stand up and debate political issues in my debate class. I can present my research in business class. My professors are top-notch. My first year seminar professor invited the whole freshman class to his home for dinner. I will never forget the delicious chicken, with spaghetti, and salad. My business professor, graduated from Cornell University, took our team of four students to lunch with a Hershey executive. What's lifetime experience."
Freshman,5,"I love it here at Dickinson! It is exactly what you think of when you hear ""small private liberal arts school"". It was definitely the right decision for me."
Niche User,5,"Dickinson College is beautiful and very spacious. The building itself is historical and incredibly beautiful. It's located in a small town, Carlisle, where there are infinite things to do after classes. This college would be a great beginning for anyone's life, especially those who like a simple life in a simple city. Dickinson college has a perfect, calm environment for those who need to study or relax. There are big red chairs located outside, which are perfect for Spring, Summer, and Fall weather just to settle down and unwind. Not only that, but also inside the college it’s a perfect learning environment with friendly people everywhere to helping to guide and lead students toward success. "
Freshman,5,"Dickinson strives to continually improve the student experience by introducing new programs, support systems, and academic resources. The teachers and the staff are extremely dedicated to the students. "
Niche User,5,"Dickinson College is a liberal arts school that provides  a diverse education which prepares its students for the real world in a manner not seen in other institutions. The small faculty to student ratio allows professors to establish personal and meaningful relationships with their students. Dickinson also provides a large variety of on-campus clubs and activities that appeal to any interest a student may have. The local area around Dickinson contains the resources needed for college life. Overall, Dickinson College is a great place to prepare anyone looking to graduate and go into their major with confidence. "
College Freshman,5,Classes are great.  Very interesting except languages but those are required.
College Freshman,5,It's a very safe school.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Dickinson is an exciting place. Everywhere you turn, there's another adventure, a new person to meet, another club to join, another interesting class. The fun never stops here. All you have to do is put yourself out there for people to get to know you and you'll find your niche. It's an accepting community and you'll leave knowing you made the right choice."
Recent Alumnus,5,The career center is really helpful and your professors want you to be successful. Every peer will help in any way they can to set you up for the rest of your life outside of Dickinson.
Recent Alumnus,5,"DPS is only here to help. If they come to a party, they just want to make sure everyone is safe. No one is looking to get you in trouble and if you need someone to walk you home almost anyone is willing to. Dickinson is very much a tight community and we look after one another."
Recent Alumnus,5,"As a freshman, you're lucky to be in Adams or Drayer. They have the nicest rooms and bathrooms by far, but the lower quad dorms aren't bad either just not AS nice. Upperclassman housing is also great."
Recent Alumnus,5,"All or at least most of the parties are thrown by the sports teams, whose games are rarely attended but everyone on the teams has really nice team ethics and are really close. Being on a sports team will definitely give you an advantage here, but its not everything."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I've only been here for a couple of weeks, but so far my classes are engaging, the clubs have been welcoming, and I haven't been bored ye (including our Drinkinson weekends)."
College Freshman,5,Great school. I love it here! Wouldn't change anything.
College Freshman,5,"I love the academics. Class sizes are very small and the professors are amazing. There are many interesting classes and academic facilities are top notch. There is a brand new science center, Rector, which is beautiful. The library is my favorite place on campus and is a great place to study. The language department is amazing. I have formed great relationships with all my professors and I love going to class. The registration process is also very easy and not cutthroat like it is at other schools."
College Freshman,5,"I just finished my first semester at Dickinson and I have no complaints. The class sizes are very small and you form personal relationships with your professors. The professors are the best thing about Dickinson. They are passionate and put a lot of effort into their jobs. The workload is manageable but still rewarding. The campus is really nice and feels integrated with the town. I have never felt unsafe on campus. The town of Carlisle is not very exciting but there are many different restaurants and shops. The bus system in Carlisle is kind of annoying and inconvenient but even though freshmen are not allowed to have cars, it is really easy to get an exception from the school. The social scene is what you make of it. If you get involved and find your niche, Dickinson will be a blast. However if you don't join any clubs or sports teams or greek life, it might be hard to make friends and have fun. I am really looking forward to studying abroad and Dickinson has one of the best study abroad programs in the country. Overall, Dickinson is a great school and I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a small liberal arts school."
College Freshman,5,"Very pleased with my college experience thus far. Amazing classes, professors, and friends. Is predominately white."
College Freshman,5,The Kline center is unreal.... theres a juice bar
College Freshman,5,As a freshman I have been very very very happy.
College Freshman,5,Dickinson makes you feel at home from the very beginning of your college career.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I would choose the same school again if I had to, mainly because I like the location and the view of the campus during the seasonal changes. It doesn't matter how stressed you are, the weather and the campus views outside will always cheer you up! The good feelings you get from the outdoors is only a fraction of great things about my college. Another most important point to highlight is the faculty. They are always available to help and they really dedicate their time well for the student."
College Sophomore,5,"Dickinson College is a great experience. Everyone is super friendly and it's easy to become friends with the faculty and staff. It's large enough that there are great opportunities, but it's small enough that you know a good amount of the people and you have a personal relationship with them. Greek life isn't huge on campus, which makes it easy for everyone to get involved with something. Often school can be like a big family and everyone looks after each other."
College Freshman,5,My major has prepared me for life after college. The advisors help a great deal.
College Freshman,5,"Dickinson is one of the top liberal arts schools in the country, the academics here are great and the professors are even better. Professors are engaging, smart and for the most part, teach well. Professors are available and willing to meet with you after class. There are a wide variety of majors to choose from at Dickinson, most of the programs are very strong.

Internships during school and jobs after graduation is what is also great about Dickinson. The alumni network is strong and growing stronger"
College Freshman,5,I was not expecting to get as much financial aid. I have an incredible package and I'm so grateful!
College Freshman,5,Excellent variety and quality options within walking proximity of campus.
College Freshman,5,The music program is likely the greatest hidden secret about Dickinson. The faculty is absolutely incredible and quite accessible and the program curriculum is highly competitive compared to other schools and conservatories.
College Freshman,5,"Dickinson is a liberal arts institution, meaning that the academic programs prepare students for the all aspects of the job market and the real world. The professors are wonderful resources and the small class sizes ensure tons of student-professor interaction. Dickinson graduates are heavily recruited, and the career services department is extremely helpful. It's impossible to leave Dickinson without discovering new things about yourself and the world."
College Junior,5,The Environmental Studies major is EXCELLENT at Dickinson College. The department is very well organized and does a great job setting its students up for success.
College Junior,5,"Dickinson's athletic program is very strong for a D3 school. I am consistently impressed with the basketball, soccer, and lacrosse teams."
College Freshman,5,They send out emails every week for jobs and internships
College Freshman,5,Workload can be challenging but rewarding
College Freshman,5,Awesome professors who are supportive and enthusiastic.
College Freshman,5,"There are many majors available. I would say more than most liberal arts schools. Anyone who wants to major in something, can."
College Junior,5,"All of the Sociology professors are amazing! A wide variety of backgrounds & interests. The classes are always interesting. Classes are often taught on relative/contemporary topics, using classical theory and fundamental concepts. Professors are always willing to see you during offices hours and are genuinely interested in helping you with your passions. They are able to connect you with alumni in your field/interests."
College Junior,5,I love the professors because they genuinely care about you and want you to succeed. There's many resources on campus if you need help. Absolutely awesome international opportunities!
College Sophomore,5,"I love my friends, regardless of their differences."
Alum,4,"I did not take online classes. At the time, online classes weren't really offered. This has changed during COVID."
Alum,4,"When I went to Dickinson, they didn't have a great orientation for new students. This has been changed and my other experiences here were pretty good."
Sophomore,4,"The college does care about the students. While they may not be perfect, they are working to improve themselves at all times. Some visiting professors/scholars though are sub-par and have no idea how to teach an undergraduate class."
Junior,4,"Most students who make the decision to attend Dickinson are choosing to do so for that quaint, small campus feel that Dickinson has to offer. This has its pros and cons. One being that the campus can often feel unnecessarily clique-y. For being such a small school, you might expect students to want to do their best to branch out and talk to people of varying backgrounds. This isn't entirely the case for Dickinson. Students of one discipline may pass through this 4 year institution having only spoken and connected to students of their won indiscipline. That aside, the school obviously has its perks. One being their study abroad program, the other being the tiny classroom sizes  that allow student's personal experience  to create insightful, productive discussions."
Sophomore,4,I love going to school here. I feel very connected to other students and faculty. I wish there was more opportunities to connect with alumni.
Junior,4,Dickinson would be amazing if they actually allowed us to have a social life... not everything is academics... we're college students and want freedom! Housing and greek life are the roots of the problem here. There is a HUGE disparity between fraternity and sorority life (many sororities but only one traditional social frat left. If you're a non-athlete male good luck! They also need to recognize we don't all want to live in dorms all 4 years (we want apartments and houses!). We don't mind living in school-owned housing we just want to live in an apartment or house! Buy some more houses Dickinson for our seniors to live in and get us out of dorms... then we'll be happy and actually donate!
Sophomore,4,"Currently, a sophomore and my first year went well. The academics are very challenging so you must be prepared when you start. The challenging this was some professors would list all the books you needed for the class as required and then when you start the class it turns out you need none of the books which is frustrating and you lose a lot of money on books"
Freshman,4,"Dickinson College, is a good institution to be challenged as a student and as a person. You will find yourself reflecting on decisions you make. Within those decisions you will try and think of there was any other way you could have done it better. Ways to challenge yourself. Not just that, but being able to challenge others. The more you willingly open you are able to being challenge, the more you will grow. Whether that's making the decision of meeting with your professor during officer hours or ways you can be inclusive within your own community. If you struggle with  finding yourself, you can always seek for mentorship, advice, but must importantly a person that can hear you out here at Dickinson. You can seek your professor, your dean, or any one you feel comfortable. Because I can not emphasize more that people in this campus care about your well being and seeing you grow as an individual and as a person."
Freshman,4,"As PWI, Dickinson strives for diversity but misses out on inclusivity in the process. However, resources available are extremely helpful and professors are very easy to reach."
Freshman,4,"The academics and the resources given to you to succeed are great.  There is a strong focus on the individual student and all of the faculty are willing to help you succeed.  However, there is a lack of diversity when it comes to income, I've found it hard to find others who came from a lower class income such as myself and therefore found it harder to make friends."
Freshman,4,"As a person of color on campus, I have seen Dickinson through a different lens. During my first semester, I experienced many highs and some lows. I found a great POC community that are willing to help you through your transition. Dickinson has many great opportunities to stay involved on campus. They have volunteer opportunities, connections, and an impressive study abroad department. It is important that you take advantage of all the opportunities the college has to offer. The dining services aren't the best but you will survive. Parties at Dickinson are somewhat segregated and you will need to find your favorite party scene if you want to have a good time. It is almost impossible to find POC spaces where you can express your culture. It's definitely something us, the students are working on. Overall, Dickinson teaches you many life lessons and academically it is a great learning environment with supportive professors and intimate classes."
Sophomore,4,Students and faculty are respectful and welcoming. Professors make helping their students academically a priority. There are a wide variety of clubs and activities.
Sophomore,4,"I like Dickinson college, but I would like to have more things to do in a short distance from campus.  The campus can feel a bit insular."
Senior,4,"Dickinson College is a great school with a tight knit community and very challenging academics. The worst thing about Dickinson College is housing and residence life. They are awful if you are going to a college expecting to have an apartment within your first 3 years do not choose Dickinson. The school is also overpriced and tuition continues to increase. However if you can afford the school and don't mind terrible housing, the academics and professors at Dickinson are incredible."
Alum,4,"Dickinson has a cozy campus in the historic area of Carlisle. During my four years there, I had some fantastic professors whose classes were very engaging, but also a couple whose classes sounded very interesting, but who, unfortunately, did not teach them well. If you want to study abroad, Dickinson is a great place to go, as about 2/3 of students go abroad with one or more of the many programs offered. They also offer a lot of financial aid. Overall, Dickinson is a good place to spend your undergraduate years and get a good education."
Sophomore,4,"I think it is a great school with a beautiful campus.  There are many problems with the school, but from what I can see, less so than many other colleges.  We have beautiful facilities, and the best parts about Dickinson are how accessible and friendly most staff and professors are, and how students can take such a wide variety of courses.  Another amazing thing about Dickinson is that the class sizes are very small, which makes classes very personable.  Some problems include limited public transportation, hard to get into classes you want, and many wealthy and contrite students."
Sophomore,4,"I love the academic atmosphere at Dickinson - the professors are amazing and it is easy to have a relationship with them. Food and housing is good, not too great though."
Niche User,4,"According to those who have told me about their experience at Dickinson College, it is an amazing school that is lacking in the diverse department. Other than that it is more than you can ask for."
Freshman,4,Dickinson is a small liberal arts school with professors that really care about what they're teaching and want to see you succeed. The campus and town are super cute and fun to explore.
Sophomore,4,I like that Dickinson is a small college because it let me get to know my fellow students not just from my year but also those who are not. The staff is absolutely friendly and so very helpful. It is a liberal arts school that welcomes all.
Junior,4,"Dickinson College is good for people who want to be away from a city, focus on their social lives or want to meet a tight-knit community of people. The professors are VERY eager to help you, however, the small campus will foster a lot of competition among people."
College Freshman,4,"My freshman floor is super small, but we all get along and it's definitely an advantage having a network of people that I live with and genuinely respect."
College Freshman,4,"I chose Dickinson as my ED school. Everyone was super friendly on campus when I came to visit, and I knew I wanted to apply right away. Like all freshmen, it's been a transition, but I've been able to quickly find people who I can spend time with and rely on for support. My classes have been challenging and engaging, and the professors do truly care about student success. My advice to anyone applying this year/in the future would be to consider how small of a town Carlisle is. It's a cute town, but for a lot of people I have come across, not having immediate access to a major city has been a real culture shock. Number two, if parties are your thing, they can be limited and occasionally hard to get into, especially for freshmen. But, if parties aren't your thing, don't worry. There are plenty of other ways to get involved and fun activities and trips to try. Lastly, don't expect football games to be huge social events. Not only does our team not have the best record, but we're also a small(ish) D3 school. Overall, it is a lively, motivated student body, and already I have created positive memories! Just remember to take all of the small-liberal arts factors into your decision. :)"
College Sophomore,4,Weekend brunch is great. I really like my advisors. The prehealth program is great.
College Sophomore,4,Professors are very supportive. Courses offered are varied but they're no open every semester.
College Sophomore,4,Prevention campaigns are part of the curriculum. Still need to work on that.
College Sophomore,4,Remodelated facilities for squash but we still need locker rooms in where we can storage our stuff
College Junior,4,"While Dickinson's campus is very safe, well light up, and it is riddled with blue lights, it is important to remember that Carlisle, PA is a small city and all cities have dangerous attributes.  One must always use caution when walking alone, especially when alone, at night, not on Dickinson's campus.  Usually, either DPS, and or, Carlisle PD are constantly roaming around but they cannot be everywhere at once.  You will most likely be safe but things happen, so use your better judgement to avoid possible scenarios where dangerous things may occur."
College Junior,4,"When attending a small school, it would come as no surprise that athletics are not the focal point of student life.  These student athletes are first and foremost students, but athletes who wanted a standout education along with continuing their athletic success.  Dickinson, historically, has above average athletic teams and specific games throughout the seasons are attended by students.  There is school spirit, but that spirit is not surrounding the athletic performances.  Dickinson has recently upgraded all the athletic facilities and they are fantastic."
College Junior,4,"After completing my second year at Dickinson College, I can confidently rate it as a great school.  The feeling when walking onto campus is that of happiness and inclusion.  Dickinson College is a space where everyone can find their niche and have a successful academic career.  After declaring a major, there is a sense of contentedness with the other students in the major and professors; a setting where relationships are formed easily and relationships that last.  At all schools, it is imperative to step outside your comfort zone and be true to yourself, and that stands true at Dickinson too.  There are a plethora of clubs and organizations that are begging you to join, you just have to make the conscience effort to let go of high school stigmas and join!  I am very happy with my choice and, if I could have a do over, I would choose Dickinson with no hesitation."
College Freshman,4,A lot of opportunities if you seek them out.
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman, you can either live on Morgan Field (Adams or Drayer) or in the Quads (Baird, DW, Cooper, Armstrong, etc.). Morgan Field is the best option because the dorms have been recently renovated and have very nice common rooms. Morgan Field is also the most beautiful place on campus and is a great place to play frisbee, lacrosse, or just chill. I live in Adams, which has the best bathrooms. They are brand new and beautiful. On the other hand, the quads aren't as nice. Baird and DW are the best options in the quads and are actually pretty nice. The positives to living in the quads is that you are closer to everything and generally speaking the rooms are bigger than on Morgan Field. However, some dorms (like Atwater, which is commonly referred to as Shatwater) are in desperate need of renovation. Another positive to living in the Quads is that there is a greater sense of community and it is very social."
College Freshman,4,"A lot of student are involved in athletics and some teams are pretty good. The better teams have better fan turn out at games. For example, not many people go to football games because they aren't very good but basketball games usually receive a good turnout and are lively. Dickinson is a small division III liberal arts school so don't expect the kind of school spirit that can be found at a division I school, but for a small school we are pretty spirited.The sports facilities are really good. I don't play any sports but I know theres a brand new athletic training center. The Kline center was also just redone and is a really great place to work out. There is also a rock-climbing wall that anyone can use."
College Freshman,4,Good accessibility to sports and sports involvement
College Junior,4,As an athlete I may have a bias view regarding the athletics sphere of the school. Regardless I do feel like games and matches are attended. A new facility was recently built and it is an upgrade from the old workout out center.
College Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed school so far. There are many opertunities to participate in activities. Also, people are really friendly and there are multiple people you meet right away who can help you with anything you need."
College Sophomore,4,Athletics are decent at the school. Great facilities especially Biddle Field and the Durden. Not many fans come and support teams unless it is a big rivalry game or a theme day.
College Freshman,4,"I like that there are so many options available for dinner, I just wish there were more late night options and student discounts."
College Freshman,4,The administrators I have come in contact with are all pretty helpful and enjoy working with college students.
College Freshman,4,It's pretty good. There are a wide variety of meal choices. I like that I can switch it up.
College Freshman,4,"Academics are good, more intelligent than intellectual though. Sometimes has high school academic vibes.  Classes are good, professors genuinely care and office hours are easy to attend. Not a huge variety of courses"
College Freshman,4,It at times can be quite good. The school is small so the staff remember names and are willing to be friendly around campus. Other times they can be a bit disconnected with the internal college conflict
College Freshman,4,I recieved a nice scholarship and it was part of the reason I attended
College Freshman,4,"Carlisle is a quaint, spunky town. There are tons of things to do, especially food wise. The Carlisle Theater is my favorite hotspot. Dickinson has a good transportation system that will take students to the local Walmart, movie theater, Panera Bread, etc. There's also a Target, Old Navy, and Starbucks just two miles away. The relationship between the town and the college is broken -- I love Carlisle, but Carlisle doesn't love Dickinsonians."
College Freshman,4,"Dormitories and themed houses are the best way to go in terms of housing. Some dorms have been recently renovated while others aren't great, so it's a little inconsistent. The social atmosphere varies, but learning communities really amplify the first year experience when taken advantage of."
College Freshman,4,Wonderful administrators. All are accessible and easy to talk to. The only issue is the speed and efficiency of making improvements. The systems aren't always very smooth.
College Junior,4,The administration generally has a positive impact on the school. The school is not TOO strict but it's not incredibly lenient either. They're very appropriate with their rules.
College Junior,4,"The health center is very accessible. Like any campus medical care, it is not perfect. However, if they are not able to help you there are several nearby clinics and hospitals."
College Junior,4,"The town has excellent restaurants - students love going off campus for dinner on the weekend. Cafe Bruge, Andalusia, and Issei Noodle are my favorites. Carlisle is also very close to D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City if you find yourself craving a more urban experience on a weekend."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek housing isn't the best--especially for sororities. However, Greek life has a little bit of a bad reputation but is undeserved."
College Student,4,"From my knowledge as a resident of Carlisle (I went to high school and middle school here), one of the main complaints of the town towards the students is that they are inconsiderate. In particular, it is rare for a student to acknowledge when a car lets him cross the street. Cross walks put in for Dickinson cross right in the middle of one of the busiest streets in Carlisle, and paint a bad image of Dickinson as too lazy to walk to the corners to cross the street. Cars have to stop for pedestrians crossing, and the students rarely wave or even look up at the cars that stopped in the middle of High street to let them cross."
College Freshman,4,"Sports aren't huge on campus, but athletes and non-athletes are respected across campus.  Academics definitely come before athletics."
College Freshman,4,"yummy food, plenty of options, sushi!!"
College Freshman,4,college has some good options
College Junior,4,"Campus police are visible and helpful. I feel safe walking home at night. I work in the sexual assault support center, so I have more insight to the problem then the average student on campus, who might report that there are no problems here. The college has been making significant strides in recent years to make the campus even safer."
College Junior,4,"A beautiful campus with nice facilities. Dining spaces can get crowded at peek hours, but that's everywhere"
College Junior,4,"Overall, you're treated fairly. No problems at all, unless you are causing them"
College Sophomore,4,"So far I've been very pleased with what Dickinson has to offer its students. However, in stark contrast to larger universities, for example NYU, the library is tiny! But we do have a decent library here with a wonderful selection; you can even borrow books from around the globe, so that makes up for our small book housing."
College Sophomore,4,"Registration is annoying. Regardless if you declare your major, you don't necessarily have priority in your major classes that you apply for. Professors are okay. As usual, the difficulty and amount that you learn just depends on who your teachers are. Majority of my teachers have been very nice, friendly, and more than willing to help me understand anything I didn't understand."
College Sophomore,4,"It's one of the most popular majors at Dickinson, and it's very rigorous with the most classes needed to graduate."
Senior,2,"SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE BETTER. Dickinson does not care about its students and consistently fails them in every way possible. Tuition is extremely high and you get poor meals, healthcare services, and treatment out of it. Find yourself a school that actually cares about you and lives up to its commitments."
Niche User,2,"Overall a nice campus with friendly faces, however, they spout a lot of liberal that if your attitudes are close to Kamala Harris or Obama, you are a fascist.  They kept talking about being a green college, which is fine, but they require a Sustainability indoctrination class to all incoming freshmen.  Even if he or she doesn't want the class."
Alum,2,"From an educational standpoint, Dickinson is a good school that offers diverse courses and has a supporting faculty that is engaged and passionate. The issue is the student life and the administration. As a Dickinson graduate, I noticed the administration was more concerned with filling their pockets (mind you the cost of attending is already $60k+). Many attempts to coerce additional funds came from banning off-campus housing (ensured each of the 2,500 students payed the full $13,000 room/board) as well as issuing egregious charges for natural wear and tear in living spaces. No exaggeration, $800 for removing tape (for decorations) from walls and $40/per item to move furniture back to its normal positioning in the living space. Something needs to change because the school will be losing out on donations and support from alumni and their families. As it stands now, if I could redo my undergrad experience, it would not be at Dickinson College."
Sophomore,2,"I transferred out of Dickinson after my sophomore year. I loved almost all of my professors at Dickinson and would love to keep in touch with them, but the thought of spending another two years in Carlisle, PA was just unfathomable. If you're someone who doesn't have a family with lots of wealth and career connections or if you're not in a scholarship network, you need to work your ass off to network with people and find good internships/employment opportunities. The insular location of the school, combined with its predominately rich, white student population, creates a college version of a prep school. The caf  (and the food sucks) even has unspoken ""designated"" tables for teams/frats/sororities. Overall, campus social life is very much segregated. Academics are not-at-all bad there, but it definitely takes a specific type of people to be happy at Dickinson."
Sophomore,2,"From the beginning it felt very easy (INBM Major) and after 2 years, it hasn't gotten more challenging/interesting.  It's very easy to stand out in academics and extracurriculars, as many students aren't very active in the community outside of their cliques, greek life, or sports teams.  Decided to transfer for junior year.  Not worth your time if you actually want to learn something or build a strong network in business."
Niche User,2,"I transferred out of Dickinson after my sophomore year. The student population is very cliquey, and more of a hierarchy than a community. You can definitely find your niche if you look a little bit, but the overall atmosphere of the school is pretty snobby, especially on some of the sports teams and in a few (not all!) of the Greek organizations. Again, that's a generalization and based on my personal experience, as I know some people who have attended and found a good group and managed to tune out the rest. However, be prepared to be exposed to some mean girls and douchy guys who value ""relevance"" over everything else. Coming from a public school in a small town where everyone is friendly I was really shocked to find what I did at Dickinson.... It's a place that looks great on the surface, but isn't always wonderful underneath that. Take a look at the freshman retention rate."
Sophomore,2,"Dickinson College has great academics and is a good place to expand your knowledge.  But as an institution that is modeling the next generation of the American work force, I'm scared.  Dickinson and the student community is working to make the future of America self victimizing and isn't creating a place where the students' ideas can be challenged and become more self reliant.  The students here complain about the world and how we need to change it, why be a part of a group that complains instead of preserves."
Niche User,2,"Students are either privileged or extremely unsophisticated. There's no in between. While the school does have great academics and professors, a lot is missing: good sports teams, school spirit, things to do on the weekends, a good town, a safe town, lack of an even male-female ratio (way more women than men), and a very limited selection of academic programs (one professor told me that I wouldn't be able to get another class in my major until spring of my junior year.) Most people here don't really like it and complain about being stuck in Carlisle all the time. I don't really feel safe in town either, there are a lot of people wandering around on the loose. I'll be transferring next year, and even though I've met some good people here, I really hope that prospective students will take the reality of Dickinson outside of what you see on the tour into consideration before committing - I wish I had.  My advice would be to do an overnight on a weekend to see if it's right for you."
Freshman,2,The college is on another planet from the rest of the world. Even the town of Carlisle separates itself from the college. The college is way more political then you may think and is very far left. Not much goes on and school pretty much becomes your life at Dickinson.
College Sophomore,2,"Dickinson is a great place for some people. With that being said it is defiantly not for everyone. For a ""liberal"" school I found many corners of campus to not be as inclusive or open minded as I anticipated. I also found that the student body didn't always feel very intellectually or academically inclined. Because the school is both small and isolated the social scene can feel smothering- I would not say there are cliques but many of the students seem hyper concerned with their social image and who they are spending time with, making it feel very much like high school. The town of Carlisle doesn't serve too much as an escape from the social scene (it is very small). I have enjoyed my classes, and many of the professors I have had have been every helpful and accessible. However, the campus vibe has not been what I had hoped for, and I found some departments to be limited (in courses etc.). My biggest advice for anyone considering Dickinson is to think very carefully about it and to understand how isolated the school is and the diversity and open mindedness that is advertised seem to be lacking."

My biggest advice for anyone considering Dickinson's to think very carefully about it and to understand how isolated the school can feel and that the diversity and mindedness that is advertised seems lacking."
College Sophomore,2,"Very hard to get off-campus housing. Even if you do get off-campus you must pay for on-campus as well, making it completely not worth the money."
College Sophomore,2,Dickinson has its own public safety which breaks up most parties. Students do not get along with DPS as they always seem to be excessive in their actions and almost always result in students getting in trouble. The parties that do not get broken up by DPS are off campus and end up getting broken up by the Carlisle Police Department which results in even more trouble. It seems there is an everlasting struggle between students and DPS.
College Freshman,2,"Many preppy, upper-class students whom hail from New England. I found the student body as a whole to be very bland, uninteresting and somewhat arrogant.

The student body is the biggest issue of the college, it's homogenous. There needs to be a culture change in Dickinson, as many students complain about one another. 

As far as looks go, it's an attractive campus. People will dress up for class and parties. It's possible to find some great people here, but you need to know where to look."
College Freshman,2,"This school isn't fashion forward, no don't expect a bunch of people in unique outfits. Guys and girls are preppy and wear nice clothes that convey their economic status.  Lot of Vineyard Vines and LL Bean boots."
College Freshman,2,"Dickinson for me seems like the wrong fit.  Coming from the West coast, there is a culture and attitude change, both internally and visible, from clothing, etc.  Staff is wonderful and classes are good along with the professors.  Activism and school spirit is not really there and it's frustrating when the primarily white students ignore current events surrounding race.  Some instances of racism have come about but that's probably just a minority of people. Carlisle is a very small town, so nightlife and weekend options are very limited so consider that.  Facilities are average, food gets repetitive but Dickinson has good things to offer.  It just doesn't work with me"
College Freshman,2,"Teams are good in some respects, but not many people attend them, seems like a lack in school spirit.  Club sports are often mismanaged by students and dedication to some is interrupted by a night of drinking"
College Freshman,2,"Nothing really around Carlisle besides a handful of restaurants.  Fast food further away but without a car, no way to access"
College Sophomore,2,I guess it could be worse but it's pretty terrible. The lottery is an awful system and most dorms are really old and tiny.
College Freshman,2,"If you have the money to attend the school, little to no money will be given.

Scholarships are generous with students of low income, or those on academic or athletic scholarships.

The process is a hassle, I do need more aid because this school is outrageously expensive."
College Freshman,2,"Many students on campus agree that the Administration sucks. 

They seem to lack the need interact with students and ignore some needs of the students.

There are some fairly big issues within the Administration and how it conducts some aspects of Dickinson."
College Freshman,2,"Very few sororities and fraternities.

Rush if you want to. 

It doesn't have a large presence at school, if your not in one it's no big deal."
College Freshman,2,"Carlisle, simply put, is not a good college town.

There are some good restaurants, couple of bars, and limited amounts of shopping.

The area near Dickinson is not safe. Robberies and assaults happen quite frequently (a student was recently mugged at gun point, and a girl was assaulted and beaten walking back to her dorm alone).

There isn't much to do in Carlisle, students usually stick to the campus. Having a car is a huge advantage."
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, my high school had better options. Why is the Kove alwayssss closed; it's really annoying, especially since I pay all this money to attend college. The line is always extremely long for the Kove; waiting in line usually takes fifteen minutes. Majority of the time you'll find me making a salad since dining services can't seem to cook vegetables properly."
College Senior,2,2 bars; The Gingerbread Man and Alibis. No clubs. The bars have slightly different scenes though and most students prefer one of the other. Always lots of townies and sometimes proessors which can be fun or embarassing
College Freshman,2,There's a shuttle to take you to the mall in Harrisburg and the train station on weekends but it only makes one trip at a certian time and can only hold so many students.  It's pretty isolated here and trying to get to the train station without someone to drive you is tough.  A taxi from the train station to campus is usually $60.
College Freshman,2,There is not much restaurants off campus. The few available are expensive and not that good.
College Sophomore,2,Carlisle goes to bed at 9pm.
College Sophomore,2,It hasn't stopped snowing since November. It's mid Feb. Ew.
College Sophomore,2,"carlisle has nothing to do, unless you love to shop walmart all the time "
College Junior,2,"It's hard and complicated to get off campus, but the places I've been seem like good places if you do get off campus"
College Freshman,2,Since Carlisle is a very small town there are not very many places to go.
College Freshman,2,"I would like to have a vehicle on campus however, freshmen are not allowed to drive vehicles on campus."
College Freshman,2,I have seen students drink but that seems to be normal at any other college setting. I usually keep my distance.
College Senior,2,"The few attractive men do not have attractive personalities. There isn't a lot of diversity, and there are far fewer guys on campus, making girls look elsewhere. The dating scene for women on campus is very difficult. To sum up the guys at Dickinson in two words: slim pickings."
College Senior,2,"The joke at Dickinson is, ""We have a football team?"" Athletes are very cliquey, even though we're a AAA school.  Lacrosse and Hockey are very popular club-sports, and students on these teams are quite popular."
College Senior,2,"There are a few places in Carlisle to dine, however, some of them are hard to get to without a car, can be expensive, and overall students end up going to the same handful of restaurants."
College Freshman,2,There aren't many options to eat here although the restaurants that they do have are very good.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus is very preppy and very generic. While there are many incredibly attractive girls, there is a scarcity of attractive men."
Junior,1,"Attending Dickinson College is, and will always be, my biggest regret. Socially, academically, aspirationally, professionally. The classes are hard. Good professors, but hard classes. If you were dumb in high school, you are going to be dumb here as well. Please don't go here. The people are not happy and the town sucks. The only way you will like Dickinson is if you went to a 50 person high school and want to join the weakest sorority ever."
Sophomore,1,"Dickinson College loves to leech off of their students. They built a new senior living space for the senior in class in order to generate more income for the school and ultimately replace off-campus housing. It's also very focused on academics and provides very minimal for the students in terms of entertainment during their off time during the weekend. School spirit sucks and is an embarrassment. The school may sound very good from the tours provided, but beware its a trap. Almost 1/4 of my class transferred after the first year after being exposed to the high school atmosphere of dickinson. Please look at other schools before coming here because other schools will provide more for the students with much less money spent. Good luck"
Junior,1,"Decent academics, good professors, not worth the money. Also, never get sick at Dickinson. Their process for requesting a Leave of Absence is incredibly confusing and only disservices the student. I should be worrying solely about my health right now, but can't, because of all of the bureaucratic garbage. I am more than healthy enough to go back to campus next semester, but the process for ""changing my student status"" is dragging on to the point where it's affected my ability to register for courses next semester. I also had employment through the school over the summer, but they took that away since I ""would technically still be on leave until the first day of the next semester."" Meanwhile, I can attend a program over the summer at another university without a problem. I pay enough to go to Dickinson that this shouldn't be a problem whatsoever. All the administration of the school cares about is money and its image.

Tl;dr Don't go here if you think you'll ever end up getting sick."
College Freshman,1,"Dickinson is awful. I fell in love with it and everything the tour guide had to say, but actually being here I can definitively say that this school is completely wrong for me. Literally everyone is stuck up in some way, which makes it extremely hard to make friends or even find people that will both to have a conversation. I came from an extremely preppy high school in a very wealthy area, yet I feel like I'm not even to the level of arrogance that many of these students are. It's extremely disappointing. Additionally, Carlisle is extremely dangerous and once it gets dark I feel extremely unsafe. There have been numerous assaults and strange occurrences on campus, such as one man with a mask on barking at students, another non-student trying to get into some girl's dorm even though she didn't know him, and very rude high schoolers from town who walk through campus at night and try to hit on women (when they don't engage the boys yell profanities at them - i've had it happen to me.) Overall this school might be right for people who didn't do very well academically in high school, and want to be among obnoxious and bratty people."
College Sophomore,1,The finaid office is awful
College Junior,1,"There is no transportation within the borough of Carlisle, although there is one in the works for 2014 and beyond, so hopefully it will improve. There is a Dickinson Safety Shuttle, which operates as a 'safe ride' (drunk van) from 9PM to 3AM, but during the day, there is no choice in public transit. There is a public bus from Carlisle to Harrisburg (train station), but it only runs 4-6 times per day and is inconvenient and sketchy at best. The town is lovely to walk and bike around, but not in certain spots. The town did recently establish a network of bike lanes and marked bike routes on the south side of town, and grocery stores and WalMart are about a mile from campus. But nearly all sophomores and above have cars and consider it a necessity. Unfortunately, freshmen are not allowed to have cars on campus."
College Student,1,"There is a fair number of housing options, but you can't live off-campus until you are an upperclassmen."
College Senior,1,"You need a car if you want to get outside of Carlisle, basically. But having a car on campus is also a hassle. So it's a Catch-22. There are public buses that travel to Harrisburg, but what is a 30 minute drive by car turns into a 2 hour hike on the CAT bus. And the bus stop is poorly demarcated and it is not a reliable system. Dickinson supposedly runs shuttles between Harrisburg and Carlisle near vacation times to help students out, but I have yet to ever see one arrive on time or at all. If you don't have a car, taxis are your best bet and that will run you between $40 and $65. Also, the closest airport to Carlisle is the Harrisburg airport, which for some reason tends to be about $200-$500 more expensive than flights from other places. If you are on the east coast already, then travel and transportation will not be as much of an issue because it's easy to get a rideshare with other students to Baltimore, Virginia, Massachussetts, New York, etc. However, if you aren't-- I'm from the Midwest, for instance--you are basically on your own."
College Freshman,1,"Next to Impossible to Leave – If you don't have a car on campus, you're pretty much stuck in carlisle. You can get anywhere from Harrisburg, a half hour away, if you're willing to pay the price (usually pretty expensive, even if it's only the train - flights out of harrisburg are even worse.) However, gettting to Harrisburg is next to impossible. The school runs a shuttle at two times in the late afternoon on Fridays and then late at night on Sunday, but if you want to leave at any other time then you pretty much have to find a friend with a car or take a cab which can cost from 40 - 50 dollars."
College Sophomore,1,"Alright, Dickinson does have a prestigious liberal arts reputation and was built in the 1700's with locally quarried stone. You can make great connections here. But let's be real this college is pathetic. The town is utterly dreary and depressing. There is no place here for a legit foodie btw. Very few legitimate parties and an embarrassing fraternity life. Bottom line: you can get the same quality education with a healthier feel in a more college-aged friendly town for less money... real talk. Last thing. Think hard on where you want to spend your college years my friend."
College Sophomore,1,Non Existant – need a car or you're stuck in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania which is like the middle of nowhere America. If you think otherwise you should travel more dawg.
College Sophomore,1,"Dickinson is not nearly as diverse as they claim to be. There is very little happening in the area of the school and if you are looking to go to a party where anything but top 40 or old-school rap are played, you're out of luck for the most part. The majority of activities outside of the school sanctioned events center upon drinking until you can't and going home to pass out (due to the lack of events in Carlisle). It gets rather monotonous quite quickly. "
College Freshman,1,"If I Could Do It All Over... I Wouldn't – I love the academics here. My classes and professors are excellent. But everything else isn't great. The social life is only good if you are willing to show some skin and hook up, or if you are on a sports team. You can't hardly ever leave campus and there aren't many options of where to go. Coming from dense New England, I miss the public transportation and availability of options for volunteering and experiencing culture."
College Freshman,1,"We do have bikes, and zip cars, but when it gets cold you don't want to bike (and there isn't anything good close-by) and there are only a few zip cars for a cost. First-years aren't allowed cars so leaving campus and the surrounding town is nearly impossible. Forget internships or volunteering as a first year."
College Freshman,1,"Social Scene, Music Scene, Where are youu??? I've found that Dickinson is amazing in terms of academics, but the town of Carlisle has next to no culture, Wal Mart is listed as an attraction on a brochure distributed by the town's tourism board. If you're looking for a music or club scene, there is none. A big issue with parties around campus is that the majority of them are held by lax/football bros and their frats, so a lot of people end up pre-gaming in dorms and wait patiently for that fun event that comes along once in a while or that party that anyone is allowed into. True, if you join an organization, you have more chances of going to a party but what happens if you just want to have fun and don't want to be given a set of obligations with your want to hang out on the weekend? I think part of the issue is that DPS (Public Safety) is just to big for the school, which means that a lot of the little get-togethers that are held near campus that everyone is welcome to, get busted right away. There is also a slight preferential treatment for athletes by public safety. an officer once said, regarding the lacross team, ""I'd like to think that I've got your guys backs and you've got mine."" ... this is bothersome as the lack of parties often forces people to go into dorms and drink more because there is nothing else to do. "
College Freshman,1,There is barely any sort of efficient transportation to Harrisburg (Where the train station and the bus station are). A cab can cost you up to $80!

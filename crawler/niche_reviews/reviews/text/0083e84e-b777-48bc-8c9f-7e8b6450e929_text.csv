Freshman,5,This community is amazing. Even though we have been online this semester i have found multiple ways to get involved and love it.
Freshman,5,All classes this semester are online. So far the professors have been very accommodating and understand as to classes being online. They have made the best of a bad situation.
Senior,5,Smaller classrooms guarantee that you get a focussed education! I always fslt like I could ask the professor questions and engage in classroom discussion related to the subjects we were learning.
Senior,5,I took a career development class online at JCU and I was surprised by how interactive it was! We had weekly quizzes based of of webinars we watched. We also had discussion sessions via video chat where we could ask questions and share information regarding our career paths.
Freshman,5,Even though my freshman year was cut short I had a great first year. At john Carroll it feels like very welcoming place. You have the chance to experience many things and take advantage of many opportunities.
Alum,5,"For the fourth time in 5 years, John Carroll’s CPA first time test success results top every school in Ohio as 73.2% of all JCU CPA first time test takers passed the CPA exam. JCU’s success tops many national universities as well that are direct competitors"
Sophomore,5,"Not only is the education at John Carroll excellent, the people that surround you to support you as you go through developing into adulthood are so welcoming that it makes the whole John Carroll experience better."

Niche User,5,"When visiting one of my friends, who plays on the soccer team at John Carroll, I really enjoyed the family atmosphere. Everything is so small and secure that I felt at home when touring the campus."
Alum,5,"John Carroll is a great school to go to if you are interested in pursuing a career in business, especially accounting. Though it is a religiously affiliated school, you are in no way required to participate in the religion. In fact, they welcome all people with different religions or none. The professors are very attentive and generally class sizes are small so you are able to get personalized attention if needed. I would highly recommend this school if you are looking for a well rounded education and experience!"
Junior,5,"The campus is gorgeous. Every college experience is about the people you spend it with, and the classes you take. If you are pursuing the right major, you know it. The professors in the ED dept are amazing. The business school is rigorous but there is a reason that we are ranked #1 for work readiness, just sayin. JCU is what you make of it, and I love it."
Junior,5,"I love it at John Carroll! We have a beautiful campus in a safe area with great academics and many unique, cultural and fun things to do in the Cleveland area. Professors here are easy to interact with, they care about students and they really take an interest in helping students succeed. Class sizes are small, and there are many leadership, research, internship, study abroad and immersion opportunities. I have met the nicest people here and while the academics are challenging, people here always step up and support each other. JCU provides fun and unique activities for students on campus and the athletic teams are always good. John Carroll is well ranked with a strong reputation and alums have gone on to much success. People think smaller schools are not fun, but  there is so much to do on and off campus that the college experience is enhanced and the good times are many.  I am so grateful to be here at Carroll!"
Alum,5,"John Carroll University has fostered an academic environment where personal relationships with professors are not only easy to come by, but also invaluable due to the rigor of the curriculum. I felt challenged by the school, but I also felt there was ample opportunity to excel."
Sophomore,5,"absolutely love being a student at John Carroll University.  I was born and raised in the Cleveland so it was a blessing having such a high regarded university close to home. JCU is underrated! Cleveland residents applying for college should really consider JCU as an option. It has so much to offer for any student who attends here. 

Academics are phenomenal. My professors are beyond helpful and seem to really care about the material they're teaching. JCU has a ton of services to help students if they're struggling with grades or need some extra help too. 

The social scene is
growing. The school is just small enough where you will see you friends or a noticeable face everyday. You don't have to join Greek Life to be social. Groups can get cliquey sometimes, but you'll see that at any university. Students at JCU are generally super friendly and are always looking to make new friends!"
Niche User,5,Small classes allow for a more personal connection with the professors. You feel very safe walking from one end of campus to the other.
Sophomore,5,"John Carroll Univeristy is a very special place. There is a great sense of community due to the small campus size and the strong religious connection. The small class size is very beneficial to the average student, as the professor knows you by name and not by a number. I think John Carroll is one of the best campuses in northeastern Ohio and it is a blessing to be going to an amazing school."
Niche User,5,"Loved John Carroll University.  Everyone was very welcoming and willing to answer any questions I had about the University.  It is secluded enough that you do not realize that a big city is right around the corner.  The education is the best part of John Carroll University.  The business school will give me every opportunity to succeed post graduation. After visiting John Carroll the first time, I knew this was the University for me.  I did visit a second time and had the opportunity to spend the weekend with the soccer team.  All of the players were friendly and welcoming as well.  When I made my decision to attend John Carroll and play soccer for them as well, some of the players got in contact with me congratulating me.  I know that I made the right decision to further my education with John Carroll University.  Go Blue Streaks!!"
Junior,5,Since attending John Carroll I am confident that I will come out with an education and experience like no other. They for me have set the bar that I want to take my education experience a step further and pursue a master's degree in english. My professors are wonderful. They push well outside your confort zone and that for me says it all about how much they care about their students. Had I not attended John Carroll University I would not be as proud as I am today.
Freshman,5,Good professors and Students. The dorms are nice and clean and the campus is very pretty. Getting in was nice and everyone is very friendly. Overall I enjoy John Carroll alot for many more reasons than above.
Niche User,5,"I have visited John Carroll University once before and my experience was very welcoming and fun. It is on the smaller side when it comes to the student population and class size, which really fits me and what I want to experience in college."
Freshman,5,I am a veteran. This school has worked with me to get my GI bill together and register for all the classes I need also the veterans community on campus is active and helpful.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love being a student at John Carroll University. I actually transferred here after attending a university in Texas for a semester. I grew up in the Cleveland area and I was also a bit skeptical going to school near home. I can now say I was totally wrong. JCU is totally underrated! Cleveland residents applying for college should really consider JCU as an option. It has so much to offer for any student who goes here. 

Academics are top notch. My professors are super helpful and seem to really care about the material they're teaching. JCU has a ton of services to help students if they're struggling with grades or need some extra help too. 

The social scene is improving! It's mostly small house parties on Saturdays, but the bar scene is great on Thursdays! You don't have to join Greek Life to be social. Groups can get cliquey sometimes, but you'll see that at any university. Students at JCU are generally super friendly and are always looking to make new friends!"
Junior,5,"John Carroll is a unique and exceptional school.  It’s is in a safe suburban area but it is also 15 minutes away from pro sports, theaters, museums, parks, bowling, laser tag, shopping, great restaurants and great health care.  There are so many opportunities for internships, research, service, immersion trips and study abroad.  Class sizes are small and professors truly care about their students and are willing to help them succeed.  Athletic teams are very good and often win the conference and the office of student engagement has so many free and fun activities for students. People on campus are very nice.  Students are at JCU for an education, classes are rigorous and there is always help when needed. Campus is beautiful and there are stress reducers like yoga, meditation and chair massages are available.  Love it at JCU!"
Graduate Student,5,John Carroll University has empowered me to pursue my goals. The staff is highly qualified and genuinely interested in my success!
Junior,5,"Close attention from professors, students well-connected, learn how to think globally, constantly learning how to help others, made aware of viewpoints that oppose your own, heavy collaboration with peers and professors in the classroom, unparalleled career resources and professional connections for students (especially within Boler School of Business), good cafeteria"
Sophomore,5,"John Carroll University is a wonderful college to further your education while learning useful, everyday life skills all while building lasting relationships."
Freshman,5,"John Carroll is truly a home away from home. It is a small campus that allows for smaller class sizes which allows for better relationships with professors. The faculty here really care about you and your academic experience. An example of this is when I was struggling in a class, I went to my professor's office hours and she was so accommodating, even letting me do extra work to boost my grade. The students are very welcoming as well. Everyone holds the doors open for you, people will say hi even if you don't know them, and it is an overall positive community. Lastly, it's proximity to the city of Cleveland allows for a lot of school-sponsored outings to sporting events, local restaurants, and festivals. Overall, John Carroll is a place that makes me feel welcome and safe and I can't imagine attending any other school."
Alum,5,"During my first year at John Carroll, I struggled a little bit adjusting. However, I quickly fell in love after I started getting involved on campus. I became a part of service programs, immersion trips, and retreats. I made friends through both students and faculty that will last a lifetime. John Carroll is a close-knit community that cares for each other; everyone is family. The campus is beautiful, the academics are top-notch, and the athletics teams are always exciting to watch!"
College Sophomore,5,I would choose John Carroll University all over again. It is a friendly campus and the atmosphere is driven towards academics. My major is competitive as a sophomore aspiring to become an Oncologist. John Carroll provides all the resources for students to succeed.  I feel it is a goal oriented University in which students are encouraged to serve the community and join clubs of their interest which promotes their field of choice. I am thoroughly enjoying my college experience thus far and look forward to the remaining two years ahead.
College Sophomore,5,Class sizes were nice and small. I enjoyed having small classes because everyone is able to discuss their opinions. The professors were very caring and helpful. Some teachers even offered extra credit to help us out which I really appreciated. The courses were not easy but they were not so hard that I couldn't do the work. I spent a great quality of time in the library studying.
College Sophomore,5,"I have not yet been a part of any internships but I have heard that many students have been set up with places like the Cleveland Clinic to have paid internships. I know that experience helps an individual receive a job that they want,"
College Sophomore,5,I honestly do not know that much about Greek life. But whenever my classmates speak about it they always sounds so enthusiastic! They say that the people involved become like a family to them and it is nice to see familiar faces around. They help each other study and get involved with activities to help the community.
College Sophomore,5,I worked in the athletic office my second semester at John Carroll. So many students participate in sports! Their friends and families all come out to support them during games. I think that the most popular sports at John Carroll were football and volleyball. The crowds are always full of spirit and cheer their school teams on!
College Sophomore,5,"I am a commuter and my first year at John Carroll was very interesting from me. I think for a commuter it is a little harder to make friends because I did not have the opportunity to have a roommate or friends from a dorm room. I did meet so many great people at my school though. I decided to work on campus and it was one of my best decisions. The students I worked along with were so kind and helpful. It was always so nice to walk across campus and see friendly and familiar faces. I love John Carroll so much, I would not choose another school because I feel at home at this college."
College Junior,5,There are a lot of companies in the area that specifically look for John Carroll Grads to get jobs.  We are proven hard working students who will do any job well.
College Junior,5,I love Carroll and the professors I have had are all caring and take the time to help me when I need it.
College Junior,5,John Carroll is very safe.  Things that happen are off campus when people make poor decisions.  I have no problem walking around on campus at night alone.  It's totally safe.
College Junior,5,Housing is nice and spacious.  I loved where I lived no matter where it was.  I believe it's the environment that makes the experience.  The girls I lived with made my time in the dorms the best.
College Junior,5,I love my school!  I wouldn't go back and pick any other school.
College Junior,5,"My overall experience at school should be defined as wonderful. I believe that I have the best professors who are able to teach the students passionately about that certain subject. All the professors are very helpful and attentive to the students needs. My school is known for their academic excellence and a high percentage of students getting a job right after school. If I could do it all over again, I would. This school brings me happiness and I feel so welcomed. I have made plenty of friends who I can see myself becoming much closer in the future. Overall, my school is amazing."
College Senior,5,"A wonderful choice of university. I felt warmly welcomed across campus and the services provided by the college, both educational and mission-based, are truly in a league of their own!"
College Freshman,5,John Carroll University takes sexual assault very seriously.
College Freshman,5,A degree from John Carroll means a lot to employers. We are a great University and the alumni network is fantastic at this school.
College Freshman,5,The professors are very nice and very experienced. They are always willing to help just make sure you keep a good relationship with them.
College Freshman,5,Living on campus has been great! The sense of community is awesome and was exactly what I was looking for in a University.
College Freshman,5,Being in Greek Life has been one of the best decisions I have made as an undergraduate and I would highly recommend that if anyone is looking to be a part of something bigger than themselves they should highly consider going Greek!
College Freshman,5,I have loved my experience at John Carroll University and if I had to go back through the college admission process again I would still pick JCU.
College Junior,5,I have heard from both faculty and external sources that JCU grads are highly valued and actively sought out by employers. The level of performance demanded from us is quite high and thus fosters academic excellence across the board. I absolutely have no worries securing a job after graduation. Internships are mandatory at John Carroll and students are often offered full time positions straight after graduation.
College Sophomore,5,"Staff to student ratio is almost 1:1, which is amazing because each student has a mentor, or someone out there who vouches for them or guides them into a supportive environment and will not give up one the students."
College Freshman,5,I live in Murphy and I love the Building it is always clean
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe on campus but I never let my guard down- you can never be to careful.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel that my time here so far and years to come at JCU is and will definitely be worthwhile. JCU has a great reputation and I am very blessed to be part of a great school for the professors who are preparing me for future, looking forward to the networking of the alumni and gaining so much knowledge during my time here."
College Sophomore,5,"Just for the same reason a house is a home only because of the family that lives there, the same goes for JCU- the professors that teach here have become my extended family."
College Sophomore,5,Housing is aged but it adds character to the campus. All furniture and appliances are brand spankin' new and in good condition!
College Sophomore,5,"I feel that John Carroll produces some exceptional students and alumni, including the newest $2.5M grant we just received."
College Freshman,5,"Everything I want in a school: several activities to do, easy access to professors,etc."
Senior,4,"Pretty good liberal arts Jesuit education. Great with scholarships, the main reason I went here. Cleveland is close, which is a major plus."
Senior,4,I found the online classes to be just as good as in the person classes yet affording me the flexibility that I needed in my senior year.
Sophomore,4,"Amazing professors and good quality classes. The food can get boring and the campus is small, but the on-campus activities are still pretty fun. It's in a safe area, but the art museum and the city of Cleveland are just a quick car trip away! Keep in mind that the business college, biology department, and sports are big here, but all of the sciences are excellent here."
Sophomore,4,I like that John Carroll University is a Catholic and private school.  It has a beautiful and welcoming campus and the instructors are enjoyable.  The students are serious about their education and to succeed and being a part of this type of environment is motivating and gratifying.
Sophomore,4,I've had a great time at this school. The climate and student body is amazing and everyone is so accepting and inviting. The professors really care about each student and offer them as many opportunities as possible.
Freshman,4,Small class sizes helps with learning. Friendly staff and campus. Classes engaging and at a good level for learning. Food is okay. Options for field of study.
Sophomore,4,John Carroll is a great place to go to school. The campus is very intimate and you will get to know everyone very quickly. The only complaint I have is that you have to live in dorms both freshman and sophomore year and cannot move into an apartment.
Junior,4,"So far, my time at John Carroll has been good. Most of the classes that I have taken are challenging, but manageable. I am grateful of all the connections I have made there."
Alum,4,I had a very good experience at JCU. The university emphasizes service and has pretty good student life with lots to do on campus as well as off campus. The teachers in my experience were extremely helpful and really cared about helping their students succeed. There are also great resources like the free counseling center and health center.
Sophomore,4,"I think that John Carroll University is one of the best universities out there. It's a community of diverse people and there are many clubs that students can join, such  as Women in STEM, and an Asian Pop Culture Club. The professors there are generally nice and will offer help to students with whatever they need."
Freshman,4,"love it! its just so happy here! diversity is really high for this city, and the different classes give you the opportunity to actually enjoy school."
Sophomore,4,The education I am getting is very good. I think they will prepare me well for Med School. The Campus is nice and the Dolon Science Center is fairy new.The housing needs work and so does the food.
Senior,4,"John Carroll University is a private Jesuit institution. Overall, I have enjoyed my time at JCU. The intimacy of the campus is phenomenal. The small class sizes allow you to connect with professors. Most of my professors know me by name. It is approx. 3000 undergrad. It is small but isn't terribly small."
Freshman,4,"John Carroll University is an outstanding academic institution.  I was challenged by professors who pulled me from my comfort zone to expand my thinking globally and personally.  The athletics are also strong in their conference and the facilities and surrounding neighborhood is charming.  I felt safe going off Camus to nearby stores and enjoyed downtown Cleveland, as well."
Sophomore,4,John Carroll is a wonderful university. There have been some issues regarding administration staff and procedures but they are working on updating their systems.
Freshman,4,"My overall experience at John Carroll has been wonderful. The people are very nice and make you feel at home. The professors are very good at using real world scenarios to teach their topics. The cafeteria food is average. Some days there are numerous good options to choose from and others there are little edible choices. The dorms are pretty nice. The only negative is that some do not have air conditioning and get really hot during the warm days in Cleveland. The only negative for me is the price tag. John Carroll is a very expensive school so if you plan on coming here make sure you have a plan for how you will pay for tuition and make sure you will have a job lined up afterwards to deal with loans. The financial office have me a hard time with the financial aid process and costed me around a $1,000 in student aid. To recap the campus life and academic life is great. The negatives of JCU involve the amount of tuition and the financial aid office."
Junior,4,"After 3 years spent at John Carroll, I can happily say that I am proud to be a Blue Streak.  All students and faculty are very friendly and always willing to help. The university reputation exceeds expectation. Having a beautiful campus, friendly staff, and a 20 to 1 student to professor ratio, what more can one ask for?"
Freshman,4,"The small class sizes are great because the professors get to know you personally. There are some pretty great opportunities in and around the greater Cleveland area. The school is just really pricey and there isn't much to offer on campus that would make it seem like a $50,000+ school."
Junior,4,"John Carroll is an academically exceptional school. They have a rigorous core curriculum and the major requirements are equally challenging. It is technically a Catholic school, but the Catholic presence is hardly felt at times. It is politically left-leaning. The professors are incredibly personable and available to help their students. That is perhaps my favorite part about the university. There is truly no greater resource to college students than having professors who care about your academic career and success. There have been countless occasions where the help or advice of a professor has totally altered my performance in a class for the better. The students are all very respectful and hard-working. The facilities are actually quite nice, with the interiors of the buildings in excellent condition. The technology is above average."
Freshman,4,"John Carroll is possibly one of the most underrated colleges in the state. It provides great academics and outstanding student life. It is not a party school, which makes it easier to focus on studies. The food needs improving, but it's getting better as the years go along. The dorms are being renovated and are making the university more sustainable to live in."
Sophomore,4,John Carroll University is a little gem in a suburb of Cleveland. I am so happy I happened to find my way here. The professors are wonderful and truly care about your performance and overall wellbeing. The community is close knit and the people are friendly.
Senior,4,John Carroll University is a small scale Jesuit school with beautiful old style buildings. Definitely could use updates on interior. Can be a rewarding experience if you get involved. There's plenty of opportunity to do mission and volunteer work. JCU sports are very successful and sporting events are fun to attend. The party scene is decent because house parties are broken up by cops constantly because students live in family neighborhoods. Great location to get to downtown Cleveland with a short Uber or Lyft ride!
Freshman,4,John Carroll is a very welcoming community. It has a beautiful campus and decent food.  Some of the dorms could be renovated.
Niche User,4,Great! The atmosphere is welcoming and made the adjustment from high school to college a breeze. The students and professors are some of the greatest people you will ever meet.
College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are small so professors can actually get to know their students. Also a smaller school allows for me to meet people earlier.
College Sophomore,4,John Carroll University priority is to keep students safe. There are always campus patrol along with police patrol. Security is available at odd hours and willing to help students and aid in their safety.
College Sophomore,4,I felt my freshman year dorm was more spacious and the building was in better shape than this year. The Millore house is run down I feel and not as appealing as the other buildings. It defenitely needs updating. The students and R/A are very friendly and the promotion of family is stressed.
College Sophomore,4,The football team at John Carroll University is the most popular sport both in involvement of playing and also supported by student body. School Spirit is infectious and promotes unity among students.
College Sophomore,4,I do not live on campus. I have been in the dorms and some are nicer than others. I remember it being extremely hot in Dolan! But other than that the dorms were well kept and the students on the floors were very welcoming.
College Freshman,4,From my experience thus far I believe the atmosphere and dorms themselves are everything and more a college student expects their first year.
College Freshman,4,Being a varsity athlete myself I think the athletics as well as the facilities are great on our campus. Many students whether varsity athletes or not are involved in athletics. Whether playing or just cheering our student involvement and the universities involvement as a whole is big!
College Junior,4,I'm not personally in Greek Life but I have lots of friends that are.  If I wasn't a part of a close net team then I would probably join.  I think they do great things for the school and community.
College Junior,4,Our teams do not win every game or series but they work hard and always put up a good fight.  John Carroll is always some hard competition to every other school in the conference.
College Junior,4,"For the past two years since I have been here at John Carroll, I would have to say that our sports team are very good. We have a lot of team spirit and fans that go to each one of the games."
College Senior,4,The university has got some amazing facilities to practice sport. It;s no wonder why the sports teams always do a wonderful job at representing the university when competing with other colleges!
College Freshman,4,"As an upcoming freshmen enrolled in John Carroll University, I have visited the campus a number of times, and found myself in a warm welcoming environment."
College Freshman,4,Athletics at John Carroll do very well such as Basketball and Football but the students don't always participate in the festivities.
College Sophomore,4,Neither a bad experience nor a good experience quite equal.
College Sophomore,4,I have nothing to say about the sporting events held here at John Carroll.
College Junior,4,"As with anything, you have to take advantage of the opportunities given. There is plenty of opportunity to join clubs, get involved on campus and attend events. Students are kept informed regularly through email alerts detailing current events on campus and general need-to-know info. Professors (in my experience) are more that willing to help if reached out to. The curriculum in general is rigorous and aimed to make us as well rounded as possible. This often means that along with core classes pertaining to one's major, other humanities classes and electives are mandatory. This is sometimes annoying because some of these courses don't always feel relevant. That being said, JCU is a good school. Employers actively seek out JCU graduates, having faith in the academic excellence that JCU prides itself in. The alumni community is also very involved in the school and are willing to help students through networking in securing internships, jobs and scholarships. I have personally received a scholarship donation from an alum."
College Junior,4,"I feel very prepared to enter the work force upon graduation. Internships are both encouraged and mandatory, forcing us to gain real life experience within our field. Diversity is few and far in between but organizations exist to foster growth in this arena."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics are fun, we could use more fan support"
College Freshman,4,"I love JCU, it's a great way place meet people, get connected, and build relationships. I like the small setting."
College Sophomore,4,Getting all A's as a science major at John Carroll is seriously difficult.
College Sophomore,4,"John Carroll usually does not have a serious issue with drugs, it's mostly an alcohol issue. So the risks of overdosing are much lower than the risk of alcohol poisoning"
College Sophomore,4,"John Carroll Holds the happy medium for all students. Courses are prepared in the way that there isn't terrible difficulty in the courses, the perfect happy medium."
College Freshman,4,The residence halls are great
College Freshman,4,i am a member of Delta Tao Delta and i have nothing bad to say about them
College Freshman,4,"Through my first semester of John Carroll I feel like I have experienced all it has to offer.  The reason my rating is so high is that through football I've met a lot of friends that I think that will last a lifetime.  However, there are many aspects of this school that I do not like.  The first is the caf is terrible.  I like the buffet style, but the lack of variety means I eat the same thing almost every day.  Next is that there is nothing in the area.  There is no food places besides the Pizzaz strip that no one goes to.  Off campus housing is too far away and the parties are cramped.  Other than that playing football and pickup basketball keeps me busy."
College Sophomore,4,"I've been very happy with the dorm options, and have just made do with the community bathrooms. I love living on campus and  plan to do so my junior hear in the Spring since I am planning on studying abroad in the Fall as well as living on campus my senior year."
College Sophomore,4,I like the small classes and the opportunities that are avIable to me. I would definitely pick my school again.
College Freshman,4,There are a few places to go to and there are alot of Carroll kids that go to them.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are big nights to go off campus.
College Freshman,4,"It is ther eif you wnat it, there are a ton of kids who g out.  There are also kids who do not drink at all"
College Freshman,4,I have never felt unsafe at any point.  Being aware of your surroundings is important anywhere but I have never felt uncomfortable or scared.
College Freshman,4,The courses are great.  The Professors are all accomodating and helpful.  There are a wide vairety and there is something for every one.
College Freshman,4,The Career service center is very helpful.  The Business school specifically has alot of oppertunities for internships and career postings.  They are also actively involved in making sure each student is professional.  There is a great alumni network as well.
College Freshman,4,I live in Campion so there is a lot of space in the rooms.  They remain fairly clean.  The heat is broken alot.  Paccelli and Dolan are not as nice as Campion.
College Freshman,4,"So far, I have enjoyed all of my professors as well as the classes.  I have grown as a writer and a student in general in this first semester.  The advisers are very knowledgeable and are easy to talk to."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is fair and helpful. Definitely each is suitable to the personality of each individual who wishes to do so.
College Sophomore,4,John Carroll University is a wonderful school when proper planning has taken place.
Sophomore,2,"I hated learning online this semester it was horrible. It was very annoying to learn on zoom, and I hated it. It wasn't a fun experience and I wouldn't recommend online learning."
Junior,2,"I came here for the Boler school and athletics, like many students, and from my experience it has been the worst. Academically, the professors are nice and helpful outside of class, but just lecture during class. You can get this at any university at a much lower price. Additionally, if you try to change your major or transfer, it is an unnecessarily difficult process and most classes will not transfer to your new major or new school. Athletically, coaches do not know what they are doing and other students are not supportive. I would not recommend."
College Freshman,2,No one pays attention to varsity athletics other than basketball.
College Junior,2,The gym facilities are old.
College Sophomore,2,The head of my dept and advisor are awful. Very judgmental and not willing to help. They will tell you one thing when you transfer but it'll be a completely different thing after you transfer. I would steer clear of this university And spend your hard earned money and loans at a school worth it.
College Student,2,there are literally no parties sometimes there is a good one around but it always gets busted and there are never any during sports seasons
College Junior,2,Theres options but they are overblown
College Junior,2,Class sizes are small and teachers treat students like high schoolers. Mandatory attendance in every class. You are forced to take some weird waste of time classes often
College Junior,2,Everyone acts like D3 is D1
College Junior,2,"lots of bugs in shower, fees for people who talk during quiet hours, only have swipe ins on womens side of building not mens side"
College Junior,2,"Easily the second worst part about JCU (following parking). The caf food is passable, and that is probably being friendly. For the price, the quality is pretty poor. Also, there are times where the food isn't even prepared well (especially the chicken). I feel as though they skimp big time on quality simply because it is a buffet style. 

The Inn Between is great though. Food tastes really good and as long as you don't go at a busy time, you can get in and out really quickly. The Meal Swipes thing is cool and I think they're expanding that.

Einstein's is perfect in between classes. They're the best workers on campus too! Great bagels, sandwiches, and coffee. Couldn't be in a better location either.

The Cubby also makes good milkshakes and specialty coffee drinks late at night."
College Senior,2,These buildings and the campus do not reflect the inordinate amount of money students pay to attend this school.
College Senior,2,"Very hard to find something at night to eat, especially delivery."
College Senior,2,Expensive for the quality. RA's can be a little overboard some times.
College Senior,2,"Most socially awkward campus as a whole. all about ""cliques"". Very high school."
College Senior,2,UHPD love to break up parties. Bars aren't fun. House parties make you feel like you're in a can of sardines
College Junior,2,There is few meal variety in the cafeteria. Only near holidays do you see something unique. The cafeteria food taste like my local high school food. The only thing that taste relatively good is in the in-between and Einsteins (although Einsteins likes to overcharge).
College Sophomore,2,"I have a car with me at school, but I had to park it off campus and the shuttles are hell. The drivers are nice people, but they are always late and wholly unreliable. There have been multiple times where I have sat and waited for over 30mins to get a shuttle. I've never had an issue getting a taxi so I can't say anything bad about them and I never really used public transportation, but the RTA busses run pretty regularly from what I've seen. If you do bring a car get an upperclassman to buy you an on campus pass, because the off campus parking sucks and is ridiculously inconvenient."
College Sophomore,2,"Basically everyone here (who isn't on ""academic scholarship"" aka sports) is white, Catholic, and republican with rich parents."
College Sophomore,2,The cost of parking on campus is astronomical and a lot of spots are reserved for faculty.
Recent Alumnus,2,Cleveland weather sucks and the university never closes.
College Junior,2,"Cleveland's weather is not something to be excited about. It is either raining or snowing. Every once in a while, you'll have a nice day, but the next day is just more of the same."
College Freshman,2,Winters are long and cold and terrible.
College Sophomore,2,Sucks how expensive it is.
College Sophomore,2,Could be a lot easier.
College Sophomore,2,"They are annoying and cliquey. Snobby, rich, think they are better than everyone"
College Sophomore,2,I do not participate in night life at John Carroll.
College Sophomore,2,"The cold and windy weather during the winter sometimes puts a damper on my day, but I look forward to the early fall and spring whenever temperatures rise and campus is alive."
College Freshman,2,It is pretty bad weather but I am used to it and don't mind. 
College Freshman,2,"Being that the largest dormitory on campus is closed for construction this year, campus housing is definitely at a low point. "
College Freshman,2,"I've lived in the area my entire life, and I know first hand the atmosphere isn't what's expected of a college. "
College Freshman,2,"This semester  I didn't pay much attention to, nor did I hear much about the varsity sports teams from the average students conversation. "
College Senior,2,expensive and spots are hard to get unless you want to walk far.
College Junior,2,"The school's food options are just like your typical college food choices.  The only thing the campus can change is having more options and more ""bang for your buck"".  Besides the school, the city has a lot of options to choose from.  you'll never get tired of eating out!"
College Freshman,2,"There is plenty of upperclassmen parking in Belvoir, but on weekends near the underclassmen dorms, there is very little parking. Once my friend took the last spot and the guys behind us keyed her car, because we got the last spot. Not very good situation."
College Sophomore,2,"There are hardly any vegetarian options. If you are trying to eat healthy, stay away from the cafeteria."
College Freshman,2,At John Carroll University the campus police and Resident Assistants take their jobs very seriously affecting the students ability to have fun. They do keep the campus safe which is why I decided to give them a C-.
College Sophomore,2,The Night Life is very limited in University Heights
College Junior,2,"some of the dorms are older, and are very rusty, and the people who clean it are not very good at their jobs. And when people wreck the halls, you get overcharged a lot for it. Bring  flip flops for the showers"
College Junior,2,Shuttle Is Slow. The shuttle is very slow and hot. I have also missed it once because the driver did not stop.
College Sophomore,2,"Really Not a Big Deal – There are fraternities and sororities, but they aren't that big of a deal. They have their own floors in the dorms and there is a 'Greek Week,' but otherwise there isn't much to it."
College Freshman,2,"I live in the midwest, so I am very used to the changing seasons,have always dealt with exterme cold and wind and hot, humid days.  Sadly, though the temperatures are similar to my home town, it does seem to be very cloudy in this area.  I wish the sun would shine more often."
College Sophomore,2,Welcome to Cleveland – The variability makes it hard to decide what to keep at school and what to take home. Usually frigid winters make it hard to go out on the weekends. It's nice that class is so close by though.
College Freshman,2,"Not Good – People are not outgoing like they are at other colleges here at John Carroll. If you are coming to this school be prepared not to have that much fun. Unless you come to John Carroll to play sports or for education, I would not recommend this school if you are looking for an awesome college experience"
College Freshman,2,"Im not a guy who likes the cold weather, so I am not a fan of the snow."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on campus is very crowded, and freshman and sophomores who live on campus are only permitted to park in a lot that is 25 minutes away (if walking)."
College Sophomore,2,"They don't give much, period. I was a 4.0 student who was president of everything you can think of. The most generous scholarship I got was about half tuition, but it keeps going up every year...but my scholarship isn't...I met with the financial aid office and they basically told me there was nothing they could do."
College Freshman,2,"Our dining is horrible, no choices between diffrent halls to eat at, all serving low quality food... lot of the people have bad attitudes too, the only alternative on campus is the in-between and it is so over priced its not funny, good food tho"
College Sophomore,2,Save Money! The college is expensive. Financial aid will help with scholarships a bit but there is still an increase in tuition annually. The food on campus is not cheap but it is addicting and it will break the bank. Get a job and save your money. Don't be frivolous!
College Sophomore,2,"Only Juniors and Seniors are permitted to park on campus.  All other students must park at the Green Road annex, which is more than a mile away from campus.  The school provides inconvenient and non reliable shuttle services to get you to your car at Green road.  The cost of a permit is almost $175 a semester.."
College Junior,2,"Large Problem – The drug/alcohol scene is disturbing at JCU.  On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, its common for large numbers of intoxicated students to vandalize student and school property, yell and scream late into the night, and ultimately lower the quality of living for sober students.  Marijuana is a common problem, even on substance-free floors, and Resident Assistants do not seem to take resident complaints seriously."
College Junior,2,"Living on Campus – The dorms are pretty standard. They are small but aren't uncomfortable. Living on campus is a bit expensive but not very much more expensive than living off campus, especially once you consider groceries. There are a lot of strict rules you must follow for living on campus."
College Junior,2,"The weather here is very unpredictable, and we get cold winters. During the fall and late spring before school ends many students hang out outside on the grass and suntan/ toss around the frisbee."
College Junior,2,"I know next to nothing about Greek Life. There aren't houses for frats/sororities they just have floors in some dorms. It seems pretty lame to me, although I do know a couple pretty good guys in frats. It's just not for me."
College Senior,2,Campus police are self-important and do very little to enhance safety. They only provide the illusion of safety.
College Freshman,2,"Don't Count on It – The only transportation I use is either the shuttle or one of my friends' cars.  The shuttle, although it stops at all the necessary spots, is not very reliable when it comes to time.  I have waited for close to an hour for one that is supposed to swing by every 30 minutes.  The parking for my freshman friends is pretty inconvenient because the shuttle must be taken to get to the off-campus parking lot."
College Senior,2,"Limited Options – There are only 3 fraternities, and 5 sororities. The fraternities are the opposite of the stereotypical frats from TV and movies as none of them are really huge partiers. The sororities run the gamut from a more nerdy stereotype all the way to gold diggers looking for an MRS. degree.

They do bring a lot of energy to whatever they do, which is something that doesn't come from many other places at JCU. So I respect them a lot for that.

A lot of people who aren't in Greek life make fun of it by saying things like ""yeah, they have to pay for friends"" or playing on negative stereotypes. To me it sounds like a lot of them are jealous of how much fun Greek life seems to be for those involved in it."
College Senior,2,"Walking Distance Option Limited – We have an Italian Pizza restaurant called Pizzazz, Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, and a sub shop called Dave's Cosmic Subs just outside the front of campus. Within walking distance there is an Applebee's, Burger King, and a few other smaller shops. Other than that, you need a car to get to more places."
College Senior,2,"Very Preached, Not So Practiced – Our administration harps on our diversity, but the opinion of most students is that there aren't many black students here (We are majorily white students, so most people don't even consider other races besides whites and blacks). I consider our black population, and other minority races, decent-sized because our school is expensive so relatively speaking I think our student population is an accurate reflection of those who apply to the school.

We have a growing LGBTQ population and had a sit-in last year where they protested the university's equal opportunity employment policy."
College Junior,2,University Heights Hates the University ...? I love Cleveland for the indie scene but no joke University Heights is terrible.  There is very little to do and the neighbors hate JCU students before they even get to know them.  The University Heights city council does everything in its' power to restrict JCU in any way they can which is very disheartening.  But there are tons of places to go hang out outside of UH.
Alum,1,If you are into sciences this is not a good school for you. Also not a great school for international students. Academically this is a terrible school with no high quality research going on. The faculty in the science department are not that bright. just look to see what kind of research they have done in their field.
Junior,1,Terrible administration. CFO is a joke and womanizer. He single handily destroyed morale and faculty-staff relations leaving the school in shambles. Any state school is much better. JCU is like a second rate community college with poor facilities and incompetent leadership who drives good staff and faculty away with their poor de idiom making.
Graduate Student,1,The majority of the students and staff at John Carroll are very racist. If you are an intelligent and determined black person staff will try to undermine your efforts.  Several professors have over fifteen years teaching experience there and should retire -- to promote classroom innovation by hiring new staff.  I would not recommend this overly expensive university to anyone!!!!
College Freshman,1,"John Carroll was not a good experience for me. The scheduling process was super difficult, food is awful, housing needs to be updated, technology needs to be updated, kids were very cliquey, and there wasn't much to do on weekends. Freshman orientation and scheduling needs to be changed, lot's of facilities and on-campus technology need to be updated, sports have absolutely no following, and there needs to be more for students to do on the weekends. Overall, I would not recommend John Carroll University and that's why I am transferring for the spring 2016 semester to a different institution."
College Junior,1,Its like someone dumped a bottle of bleach on the school. Its like 98 percent white here. Its awful. Racist undertones are everywhere
College Junior,1,Zero diversity. Majority of people are racist. Especially when drunk you'll hear lots of crap about the local synagogues and Jewish community as well as the black communities downtown in cleveland
College Junior,1,If getting beer poured on you by nasty white boys is your thing then go for it. Parties are small. Always busted around 12. Occasionally one good party will spring up but a majority involve sitting and standing around some guys playing pong
College Junior,1,minus the expensive food cooked at innbetween the food on campus is awful
College Junior,1,"This is the worst part of JCU. Absolutely ridiculous how hard it is to find a spot. During class hours, there's a good chance you're parking all the way by Dolan. Still, though, compared to big schools, the walking distance is very little, but it's all relevant. They need to build a garage where the main lot currently is especially with expanding freshman class sizes."
College Senior,1,Greek life is laughable here. No frat/sorority houses. Very small following. Comical.
College Senior,1,Zero school spirit. Attendance at all events except basketball is horrendous
College Junior,1,"Being a Biology Major, I feel like its one of the worst departments in Dolan. Most of the instructors care more about their research rather than caring about the actual students. My biology adviser keeps telling me I should reconsider doing something else instead of trying for medical school. This would be fine, but she offers no advice on what I should do AND doesn't respect my decision for pursing it. How about helping me out and figuring out ways so that I am able to get into medical school instead of pushing it to the side and saying that its impossible for me."
College Senior,1,worst part of JCU. They suck. Throw terrible parties and do not even have houses. They think they are bro but not at all. Girls are hot though.
College Senior,1,Overpriced and hard to find a spot.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Never any free parking that's less than a mile away from where you're going, especially when you pay for a parking pass ($350/year)."
College Junior,1,Cleveland Winters are NOT fun.  Bring a sweater!
College Sophomore,1,Nightlife? There is no nightlife at JCU. None. Unless you want to hang out in your dorm room ALL NIGHT and do... something? I don't even know. Nightlife at JCU is terrible. 
College Sophomore,1,I hate all the food on campus. All of it. I would rather have my own kitchen and ditch the terrible meal plan. Beware the tasteless and fatty food. 
College Freshman,1,"My campus has a very low level of diversity, located in a suburb of Cleveland, ohio, a relatively diverse city, this is disappointing. "
College Sophomore,1,"No. Parties get busted in approximately 57 minutes. The ""fun"" parties are the ones where there is a DJ (aka an 8 yr senior with GarageBand) and there are 434 kids shoved into the basement like livestock. No free booze anywhere. Every party is BYOB. No close bars. The pub is fun, but a ride is necessary. 

Please rethink your decision to come to JCU if a fun nightlife is important to you."
College Freshman,1,"The staff is very friendly and take good care of the cafeteria, but the food just isn't very good. There isn't much variety, and the quality just isn't very high. Pizza, hamburgers, grilled chicken, and french fries are offered almost everyday and rarely substituted with another option."
College Freshman,1,"if you like playing water pong in a basement with a group of people drinking natty, you're a blue streak forsure."
College Sophomore,1,John Carroll is filled with people who cannot handle themselves socially. The surrounding area is also extremely lacking. I can find better parties and more enjoyable people in my hometown.
College Freshman,1,"I went to John Carroll to stay close to home but quickly found that it is just not the place for me for many reasons. First, the business school never has enough classes and you almost always get put on a waiting list for classes that you need to take prior to your major classes. Second the school just blows all of their money on meaningless things. For example they spent $40,000 on a music festival no one went to. You would think paying all that money it wouldn't go to waste but it does. The Student activity board of SUPB as they call it here seems to be run by a bunch of parents. No one ever wants to go to the events they have and when they do have something decent no one shows up. John Carroll definitely has that small school vibe within just the first month of your freshman year people will start to ""clique up"" and have their little groups. Lastly, if you are not into sports or athletics do not go to John Carroll. The school seems to put too much emphasis on sports and thats probably where all the money goes. I'm not giving JCU a F for the reason that the academics are good and they try to prepare you the best they can; but if you want to have a great knowledge and job opportunity at the expensive of not enjoying college then go for it"
College Freshman,1,"There are international students, but many come from similar affluent backgrounds like the rest of the school. Coming from a very diverse public school, its been a big difference."
College Freshman,1,"Nightlife is not for students who are under 21. I do NOT drink or do idiotic parties, so often times I'm in the dorm all night with friends."
College Junior,1,"Weather is often poor at JCU, but classes rarely get cancelled. As a commuter, I am highly distressed when it comes to getting to school during the winter."
College Junior,1,"The weather here in Cleveland, Ohio really is a play by play. One day you have snow, the next day rain, then a really hot day, then back to cold weather.  It really messes with your allergies and tends to get alot of people sick, so stay healthy and buy alot of hand sanitizer!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Not Very Good – The food on campus is not good at all, and there are very few places off campus that are within walking distance."
College Freshman,1,There is none. People go Downtown Cleveland the first week there but then they all say they hate it. You have to drink in the dorms. The sexy girls don't leave their dorms because they feel like they are too good for the house parties. The house parties are a waste because they make you pay to get in and sometimes are picky about who they let in. Occasionally there will be like one or two really awesome partes at someones house. Everyone parties in saturday nights because thats when the sports teams are done with games so they can drink. The only houses are the sports players houses because the fraternities and sororities are a joke. there are 3 frats and 4 or 5 sororities but they all do their own thing and all hangout with each other. There are way too many cliques and everyone thinks they are all that. real talk. D for the occasionally sweet parties.
College Freshman,1,Cleveland is Cleveland.  It can rain for a week or snow for days straight.  We had one sunny week in October and everyone could not believe it.  When it snows it puts a damper on the party scene.  The same goes for when its raining.
College Senior,1,"To them, we are students who don't know what we're talking about. It's especially hard if you're the first person going to college, the only person paying for tuition and other bills, and from an immigrant family who doesn't speak English at a proficient level; most students are dependent students from the country or suburbs. The financial aid office have lost financial aid packages and information from other students, including myself. They are also very unorganized and if you continue to ask them for help, they can get angry at you quickly even if you ask them in the most polite voice. The best way to combat any financial aid issues is to be persistent. Take names of the people you saw. If one person can't help you, move on to the next person until you get the help you need. Make copies of documents they send you and of forms that you fill out for them, such as verification forms."
College Senior,1,"Since the school attracts many students from the surrounding areas, they bring their social cliques with them. People such as myself from out of town who may not have the same beliefs or wear the same clothes as them are seen as the weird new kids. The school is a Catholic college but the biggest irony is that the students drink so much that we are the number 1 drinking Jesuit college in America; there's not much else to do on campus unless you have a car to head to downtown Cleveland."
College Junior,1,"Too Strict to Enjoy – Campus policies seem to be centered around petty issues such as dorm visitation and noise violations.  More serious issues dealing with drugs/alcohol are dealt with by a fine, a disciplinary write up, and disciplinary probation, and do not tend to help the drinking problem.  Less serious, accidental issues tend to result in serious consequences.  If you live on campus, you may feel that the dorm life is too strict to enjoy."
College Junior,1,The cost to park on campus is ridiculous and no students are ever allowed on campus without a permit. It is incrediby inconvenient when I forget something in my dorm and have to spend an extra 20-45 minutes to get back on campus because I must take my car back to the lot. It is very frustrating when I have to be ready to leave an hour ahead of time in order to make it on time because the shuttles are so unpredictable.
College Freshman,1,"Not Very Vegetarian Friendly – There are not many options for those, like myself, who are vegetarian."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at John Carroll is a major downfall. Only juniors and seniors are permitted to park on campus, and even then you are required to purchase a $150 parking permit. If you are a freshman or sophomore and you have a car (I would recommend having one) you have to park off campus. The school offers shuttle services, but they are unreliable. It takes almost half an hour to reach your destination."
College Junior,1,"A Way to Get Student's Money – As a small school with lots of commuters you would think that parking would be more readily available for students. I live off campus and can't afford insurance so I can't drive, my roomates who have insurance can't afford to buy the ridiculously expensive parking pass. I believe it is just a way for the university to take students money."
College Senior,1,"Off-Campus Castles – I have never lived off-campus but I know people and friends who do and they love it. A lot of the off-campus houses are duplexes. Having a duplexe with friends is a lot better I think because everyone can flow from up stairs to down stairs freely. I have heard that the houses on Warrensville are decent, although expensive."
College Sophomore,1,No Punishment for Underage Drinking? There is a lot of underage drinking on campus. The sad thing is that a lot of those that are drunk are drunk around the security officers. Many get drunk for the homecoming dance and are completely wasted during the dance.

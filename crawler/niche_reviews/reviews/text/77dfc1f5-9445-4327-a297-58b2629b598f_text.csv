Sophomore,5,"Along with great on campus learning, Illinois Central College offers very informative and flexible online options. With the great advisors and professors that the college has to offer, students will always be ready for what is yet to come."
Sophomore,5,"Illinois Central College is a very financially smart yet beneficial alternative than almost all of the 4 year colleges in the Central Illinois area. ICC offers many different majors, along with the courses necessary to thrive in them. With a rather large campus for a community college, ICC offers reasonable room and board and very financial friendly dining options. Nearly every class taken at ICC will be transferable, and at almost the fourth of the cost of the more traditional schools, you cannot beat it. Make your #SmartChoice today."
Freshman,5,"I am just getting ready to start but so far everyone has been amazing and so helpful. Any questions I have had, someone always gets right back to me with an answer."
Freshman,5,"This is how I will be taking my classes for spring semester. I am so excited and nervous at the same time, as I have not been in school for like 14 years."
Alum,5,I preferred doing my classes online. The online setting is put together well and easy to succeed. I liked the online classes where you work at your own pace instead of having a schedule.
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online courses. There was, of course, the quarter during COVID-19 lockdowns, which I felt that they did a great job with considering the situation, but that's all."
Alum,5,"It was important to me to receive a quality education, and ICC more than delivered. I learned so much from the professors, even beyond the academics, that can be applied outside the classroom to help move my career farther. Resources were always available, often in abundance, when help was needed. Scheduling was always easy to figure out with lots of options."
Sophomore,5,I’ve been going to Illinois central since 2008. This is a great school to complete all your prerequisites and most of the staff are very helpful. I would  say Illinois Central College is a good college to attend to
Sophomore,5,"I’ve taken a lot of my prerequisites online such as English, medical terminology and psychology. My experience with those classes has been awesome. The professors that I had were very helpful and they care deeply about their students."
Niche User,5,They have a lot of hands on learning and have a wide variety of options to choose from in making a career decison.
Sophomore,5,I am currently a student at Illinois Central College but plan on transferring to Illinois State University this fall. This will be my fourth semester at ICC. I enjoyed my time at ICC and attending here definitely saved me money and it was very convenient.
Sophomore,5,"Illinois Central College was a great place to start my college education. The prices are unbeatable compared to regular university classes and when you're trying to get gen-eds out of the way as debt free as possible, it is in my opinion the best central IL option. The class sizes are much smaller than university and therefore you get to know your teachers more and can have easier access to one on one help. Despite being a community college  I have made countless friends here. It is a very diverse campus and has many organizations/clubs and programs of study available. Most importantly, education is at the forefront of ICC'S priorities and they have a lot of transfer arrangements with local Universities. I would highly recommend ICC."
Sophomore,5,"ICC is a very good choice financially, tuition is cheaper than most other colleges.  The teachers there are very friendly and helpful.  The overall atmosphere is much like high school, you won't be getting the college experience here. However, if you want a cheap, good quality degree then ICC is a great choice."
Sophomore,5,I loved the programs and the staff. it well ran and I respect how the people treat other. They make you feel at home while your away from home.
Sophomore,5,"My experience was very good. I was granted a Peoria Promise scholarship and saved a ton of money and still got a great education! The professors are very accessible, the campus provides many resources, and the education was just overall great."
Junior,5,I like that the college offers online classes for those who can not take off work to go to class everyday. One thing I would like to see change is how some teachers treat their student.
Junior,5,ICC is inexpensive and the faculty and staff  are friendly.  Also all the classrooms are easy to find.
Sophomore,5,"I love this college, especially the Ag programs. The professors are there to help you and they care that you learn what they are teaching and they help you succeed in their classrooms. They teach you stuff that you actually need to know. I haven't spent much time in the academic side of the campus but from the classes that I have been in, it's also great and is they same as the Agriculture side of things when it comes to the Professors. ICC is a great college and I am Proud I chose this college instead of anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,Illinois Central College was a great experience for me. The educators there genuinely cared for their students and did their best to ensure that we got the most out of our time there.
Niche User,5,I loved visiting the campus and learning about all their programs! And cant wait to go there next Year!
Sophomore,5,"ICC is a great school for someone to start their education, most of the teachers genuinely care about their students and are willing to help them if they have problems"
Freshman,5,I like that this college is affordable and close to home.  My classes are small and I Get individualized attention from my professors.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the professors and everything that they do for their students.
Everyone is so helpful and would go above and beyond to help with academics or give personal advice"
Freshman,5,ICC is a very cost effective school if you want to save money before going to a 4 year school.  The professors are nice and very helpful.  I was able to have the same math instructor for three of my math classes which was very nice.
Freshman,5,ICC is the perfect opportunity for new high school graduates to settle into a college routine and focus on course work needed before transferring to a university.
Freshman,5,The teachers are always attentive. They make sure you know what you are doing and help if you do not. The advisors are super helpful and make setting up classes super easy.
Alum,5,"Overall a good college and very affordable. They offer great scholarships. The classes were challenging, but not overly difficult. The professors were intelligent and most of them care about the student's progress. It's a great community college to start off attending."
Sophomore,5,"I am a second-year student at ICC, and I have loved my time here. ICC is an amazing school with professors who really care about you and your education. I have maintained close friendships with several of my professors whom I have worked with outside of school. To enrich my time at ICC, I have been involved with Reader's Theater, Underground TV, ICC This Week radio broadcast, as well as Phi Theta Kappa Honor's Society."
Freshman,5,"It is a great college, since the first time i came to visit ICC i fall in love. The campus is beautiful, And not only that everyone is super nice. They offered a lot of help to those who need it."
Junior,5,"I love Illinois Central College!  I drive two hours both ways to attend, and this school is well worth the drive.  It is very clean and friendly.  Easy to navigate around, and the staff is extremely friendly.  The cafeteria is huge with many side rooms for quiet and private conversations.  The food selection is wide and there is always a variety!  The library is absolutely beautiful with many separate rooms for group activities and studying, as well as rooms with mini computer labs!  I give this college five stars and 2 thumbs up!"
Freshman,5,"To be honest I really like all the services that they provide at Illinois Central College , but the thing that I think they should change is to  reduce the price for international students, for example  in stead of paying like one thousand dollars for one course I think they should reduce to May be $800. Apart from that I don't there's other thing needs to be changed."
College Junior,5,All 31 of my credits transferred. The person I needed to speak with to make sure my credits transferred was very nice and helpful during that portion of transferring.
College Junior,5,I haven't actually taken an online class but the class access through black board is user friendly and also the access code sites are easy to use and very helpful with studying.
College Junior,5,I do not have anything to add for this section of the survey.
College Junior,5,Everyone is wonderful. Real life applications to the course work really help drive home the things we need to know.
College Junior,5,"I am not to this point in my program yet. However, I feel I will be well prepared for the work-force when my program is complete."
College Junior,5,I do not know about interning yet however the educators are very helpful.
College Junior,5,"Everyone I have encountered has been very helpful in all aspects from financial aid, choosing classes, and in the classroom"
College Junior,5,"I have gained ""real world"" experience.  This program will be very helpful as I start out in the ""real"" world."
College Sophomore,5,"The best part about online classes was not having to physically be at ICC. Seriously, any opportunity to avoid being there is worth taking. I do have to give the college credit for the number of classes they offer online. There are many options that make tailoring your schedule pretty easy. Just don't expect to learn too much."
College Freshman,5,All my teachers have been very accessible and truly interested in helping me be the best possible student.
College Freshman,5,My adviser has told me that the local hospitals really like the ICC nurses because they are so well trained.
College Freshman,5,I chose ICC because I can work and take a variety of courses when I have the time for them.  I also know that the nursing program is unique because I will be assigned to a hospital and I will have to arrange my life to their schedule. This is a minor adjustment for one year of my life and will be so worth the effort.
College Freshman,5,Admittance to the health science programs is based on a points system.  This helps the student manage their course load by taking their advanced sciences and humanities prior to being enrolled in the nursing program. Extra points are awarded to students who work in a health field (CNA) environment assuring this is the field the student wants to invest their time with. This allows the student to focus on building a solid base of education before beginning the rigors of the nursing program and helping the student to graduate with confidence.
College Freshman,5,"ICC is an affordable education employing many doctoral professors. Students can grow and change their major or just take courses that interest them as they decide on a course for their life.  Almost all courses are transferable to any four year institution, even years from now. All the education gained  at ICC is applicable to their chosen career path and has been the best decision I have made so far."
College Sophomore,5,Scheduling at ICC is very flexible and there are multiple classes of the same course to fit your scheduling needs.
College Sophomore,5,"Many classes that I took really helped me understand and learn about the world around me. Most of these classes were business classes and history classes, where the professors made it a goal to encourage all the students to become involved with lecture and want to be interested in these fields."
College Senior,5,ICC is a amazing school. They have the best teachers.
College Junior,5,"The classes and professors are great as long as you look up your professors on ratemyprofessors.com befire you register for your classes. I have never been disappointed with any if my classes or professors. I would highly recommend going to ICC. Despite what many people are saying on here, the teachers do care and will help you if you need it; you just have to ask for it."
College Junior,5,"The class schedule is the most flexible I have heard of. They have classes pretty much whenever you need them. They have morning, afternoon, night, and online classes. So basically no matter what your schedule is, they will find a way to fit their classes into your schedule."
College Junior,5,"I would tell you all the fun times I've had at ICC but there is not enough room. I have had more fun experiences here in these past two years then I had my entire 4 years of high school. I would definitely choose ICC if I had to do it all over because I have had a great education, have made many new friends, have so many fond memories, and have just thoroughly enjoyed my time spent here. I wouldn't trade the experiences I've had here for anything in the world. I would highly recommend going to ICC, especially if you are looking for a place to complete your gen eds."
College Junior,5,"I pay less to go here than I did going to high school. I pay about $3,000 a year at the most to go here. I paid that much per semester in high school. So I would definitely say that the tuition is very reasonable here."
College Junior,5,"I am a full-time student with a part-time job and I have been assisted with making my schedule flexible so that I can continue to work and go to school, and be able to easily manage both."
College Junior,5,"The registration process has been easy for me; it isn't a really long process and, if you get it done early enough, you will most likely get the classes that you need and want.  The classes are challenging, if you're in the right class, and the professors don't allow you to slack.  They encourage you to stay on track but they let you know that they aren't going to do the work for you."
College Junior,5,I have always had good experiences with the computer network at my school.  I am able to type a paper and print it off right there in the lab or library at no charge/costs.
College Junior,5,The campus resources are very resourceful and easy accessible.
College Junior,5,"I enjoy the online course that I am currently enrolled in.  I know what is expected of me and although it's an online course, we meet for lecture 2 days out of the week. If I need assistance with anything, my professor can be easy to contact and is always willing to help."
College Freshman,5,My major at either school that I go to will be in crop science. My program is different from many others as it is a growing industry not only in terms of jobs but also in terms of the improvements in science and technology. With this program there is a lot of work to be done because a lot of the classes will require projects because that is the best way for the students to learn. There are multiple job opportunities in the crop science field because it is a rapidly growing industry that needs the young people to bring in new thinking and energy.
College Sophomore,5,We have many places to study. When its nice we mostly sit outside and enjoy the weather. Inside we have a couple bridges we can sit on or quiet areas. The gallery has to be my favorite part. We have two different galleries and its filled with sometimes a students work or a classes work. Every now and then we have artists come in and hang there art as well as a learning experience. We also have a great performing arts center. It is beautiful inside and around the theater are painting by artists. The paintings are never the same.
College Senior,5,"Tuition for this spring semester (2014) was $115 per semester hour. Full-time status is 12 credit hours, meaning the tuition for this semester is $1,380 and the tuition for the whole year is $2,760. Tuition alone at the transfer school I am looking at is $29,030. ICC is amazingly affordable and is still a fantastic institution. If the full amount of tuition cannot be paid at the due date, the student accounting office with help you set up a payment plan. The ICC Educational Foundation gives away over 900 scholarships each year to students."
Junior,4,"I didn't take an online course at ICC until fall of 2019. However, after Covid-19 hit in the Spring of 2020, all my courses transitioned online. The professors all did a good job of making sure we were not only understanding the material, but that we were staying healthy, too. They understood that not everyone learns well with online classes, and took that into consideration. The online courses here at ICC are above average, and I would recommend them especially to anyone who needs classes that can fit into their busy schedule."
Junior,4,"Illinois Central College is a great place to discover what it is you want to regarding your career. Taking general education courses is a great place to start for a reasonable price and with helpful professors. Though it is a community college, it focuses on just that - community. I have never been to a college that is more focused on keeping it's students engaged and healthy,  especially in 2020. This college is where I was able to find my interest in interior design, as well as make several new friends, which is something I struggled with in the past. Being homeschooled throughout my high school years, I was also able to be enrolled very easily, which made for a smooth transition, too. Overall, Illinois Central College is a very good school that I recommend to all locals before impulsively deciding to go to a 4 year university."
Junior,4,"It's not a bad school by any means. It's average for a community College. There are many very nice professors who are passionate about what they do. They have a lovely music department, but the theatre department is severely lacking, which for me, a theatre student, is very disappointing. The food is decent. Parking lots are dangerous during the winter. I would love to see some improvement there. All in all, I have enjoyed my time here."
Sophomore,4,Before the pandemic I took all my classes online except for my summer and it was a smooth process. The professors were very helpful and still are to this day with classes being online.
Sophomore,4,"Considering that it is a community college, I believe that starting here for my college education was the best decision I've made. I love how everyone is friendly and goes out of there way to help you succeed."
Niche User,4,"So far I have only took one class online and another class that jumps for online to in person. For the most part teachers are very passionate with the transition to zoom and understand things. Most of them know how to work online but some don't know as good computer technology compared to others. Although it is not my favorite thing to do online learning the teachers try to keep it interactive asking you questions. Give you 10 min breaks to stay awake get a drink or eat. Most of the time its questions we have ask them and they answer it to there best ability which is always nice to have. I don't like taking timed quizzes or test because I am a slow reader but everyone else has to do the same thing. sometimes zoo does not work so you just have the day off from class which is always nice too. You can do the online session wherever which is nice can just stay in bed and wake up 10mins before your class instead of waking up hour before and driving to campus, and professors get done early"
Niche User,4,What I liked about ICC was the East Peoria campus was very nice clean everyone there pointed me in the direction I needed to go. The teachers communicated with me and understand me and got back to me within 10 minutes notice. It is cheaper than going to a 4 year school. I can do college work from home or online rather than paying for a dorm room.Sports are vert completive and usually get students from local high schools. The facilities are new and complete the cougar complex is the place to go to shoot some hoops or workout upstairs. The baseball field is very nice and its cool thinking that Jim home played on the same exact field. Although people pointed me in the right direction it is confusing which campus you are at and where to park sometimes wish they would make that more clear.Its a very nice two year school to just get the basics out of the way and play some sports while your at it and save 10x more money then going to a 4 year would highly recomended to go here
Alum,4,I liked the ease of access and the professors that are always available to help. I would like to see some more American professors in Calculus because sometimes the accents are hard to understand and retain memory of
Sophomore,4,I have taken multiple classes online. I love the quick responses from my teachers and they way that they reached out when they saw me struggling.
Sophomore,4,"Professors at this campus are very professional, but also personable. Both campuses have extensive libraries. The only complaint I have is the access to food at the Peoria Campus. Multiple options in degrees are offered. I was hoping for more degrees offered in the health career field."
Sophomore,4,"Illinois Central college is an exceptional junior college. The amount of resources and student aid at your disposal is extensive, especially for a community college. The course material is challenging and engaging. The majority of the professors are excellent teachers and are invested in their students' success. Overall, I recommended attending this college if you still retain the rigor of a 4-year university for a much lower price."
Freshman,4,"I took some night classes at ICC. I did not feel very safe leaving the college, it had some poor lighting. However, the classes and the professors were very good. They were willing to help all the students. The best part of the college was the tuition rate! It was very cheap and the education system was great!"
Sophomore,4,I like that I get financial support and it’s close to home some of the professors are boring but I do like some of them as well
Alum,4,I liked that it felt welcoming. That there was a club for everybody to feel included. I think the school could work on the grading system and expand the food menu. Like most of the food contained either cheese or meat so more vegan options incase some have allergies.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed the classes and instructors. There are a variety of classes that are available. There are multiple courses available to learn different languages, such as American Sign Language, Spanish, Italian, and a few others. American Sign Language is taken as a course at ICC which isn't usually available for credit at other colleges. The only downsides to ICC are the seasons that are available for the courses. Some courses are only available at certain times of the year. I was unable to take a couple of classes because it wasn't available until the spring. Also, some improvements could be made on the staff. Some general counselors are not helpful in decision making for classes. I have felt offended with some of the counselors as they insulted me on my academics. I found it very discouraging at times coming to them for academic guidance."
Freshman,4,"Illinois Central College should be at the top of  your list for a community college that offers solid academic courses for an unbeatable price.  It is much cheaper than many other colleges.  In my experience, there are some instructors which are not as preferable as others, but that is the case with most colleges.  I am currently enrolled in their program for mechanical engineering (two years at ICC taking the gen-ed courses and a few engineer-specific courses before transferring.)  They are well known for their nursing program, Cat diesel program, GM automotive program, engineering programs, and many others.   In conclusion, for the price, it is harder to find a better two-year university."
Sophomore,4,Illinois Central College is one of the best community colleges in Midwest Illinois. Professors and Advisers are wonderful and flexible for students with a crunch for time or resources.
Freshman,4,I have been attending off and on for the last 9 years while raising my children. My professors have been very accommodating letting me reschedule proctored exams and even bringing my children with me to class when they were ill and childcare fell through.
Freshman,4,The costs for the school are amazing. I'm getting the same education I would be at a four year school for only like a fourth of the price. The people are also nice. So far all of the professors I've had are great.
Freshman,4,"So far, I have attended ICC for 1 semester.  I have enjoyed my classes and teachers.  My advisor has been very helpful."
Sophomore,4,I have had good professors all except one I had freshman year. School is clean and a good ransition from high school if you are unsure if you are ready to attend a four year university directly out of high school. It prepared me for what college was really like.
Sophomore,4,"I have mostly enjoyed my school experiences at ICC. Most of my professors have been good for my educational goals. I have been supported by my adviser when I have struggled with classes or program direction, including changing my program when it was obvious I was not succeeding. The campus facility is updated and conducive to my educational needs. My fellow students have been good to work with. The bookstore is helpful with the supplies, books and resources I need. Parking is easy to work with and free which is helpful. Overall I have really appreciated my schooling at ICC."
Sophomore,4,"Illinois Central College has a great student to teacher ratio, with flexible scheduling, and many opportunities for scholarships. I enjoy attending Illinois Central College, because I believe that the level of education is on par with most other universities, for a fraction of the price and it encourages me that I will be able to achieve my goal of going debt free all of my college career."
Freshman,4,everyone here does their best to make sure you succeed if you want to. the advisors take into consideration what you’re looking for and try to match you to classes as best as they can to make sure you are on the right track
Freshman,4,"My professors have been excellent, and the campus is beautiful. ICC is both affordable and a great place to receive an education!"
Sophomore,4,"ICC is a pretty good college. The professors are hit or miss but that's pretty much at any school. student life is alright as long as you want to be there until the evening. living off campus is probably the best because I've heard many horror stories about the dorms. All in all, you will get your money's worth out of it. They actually try to save you money on textbooks. The only time I spent way too much on a textbook is when the professor doesn't require the online material."
Sophomore,4,"I like the professors, they are very kind and willing to help. Although there are almost NO activities at ICC."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy going to the college. It is a great place to start a college career. Not only is it more affordable than a university but it is also a great way to get used to the college world. The class rooms are bigger than the normal high school classes but they are not huge lecture halls like they have in university. I like that the classes rooms are more independent than high school but you still have some guidance from the teachers.
Freshman,4,Illinois Central College makes education affordable.  I am able to get my degree by attending school for two years rather than taking out a lot of student loans and attending a 4 year school.  They offer the Physical Therapy Assistant program that I am currently enrolled in and will help me to achieve my goals when I graduate.
Freshman,4,I like that it's easy to be independent while attending this college. What I would change is how difficult it is to get information via email.
Junior,4,Overall I really enjoyed ICC. It has prepared me to transfer to get my 4 year degree at OSF college of nursing. ICC has really went above and beyond to make my transition very smooth. They have great professors who really want you to do well and succeed. The financial advisor their were amazing also. They wanted to help you and listen to your needs. ICC is a great school and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't know what they want to do with their future. They have many courses to take that allows you to think what you want your future to be like.
Sophomore,4,"Illinois Central College  has a really great environment. It is a very clean and decently safe campus. Campus security is very well prepared and trained for any situation.  They are also always on call and will come to help you in any situation. Big or small. From fearing another student to you locked your keys in your car. The teachers at Illinois Central College are very nice and are really there to help you reach your education goals. They are willing to help in or out of class, they will make time for you. The library is a great place to go if you need information for a research paper or just need a quiet place to focus. ICC also has very helpful FREE tutors that know what they are doing and how to help."
Junior,4,Illinois Central College is a great community college. They have a very nice campus and everyone their is friendly and helpful.
Sophomore,4,"I have found my time at Illinois Central College to be quite enjoyable. all of the teachers that I have had in my classes have been helpful to students when they needed guidance, and they do a great job at making sure that the students understand the materials that we learn in class. The other staff, such as the janitors and cafeteria workers, are also very nice. They all have good manners, and they are great at their jobs. I like being able to see and meet new people every day, as well as being able to meet with my friends that I have known for a long time already."
Freshman,4,"I like how there is a very diverse student body, so you can get to know first-hand different cultures, and having a diverse population can make someone more knowledgeable. Sometimes the student services are not up to par, as they have lost some of my papers I gave them, and are just a bit hard to work with. Overall, I think ICC is an amazing college."
Freshman,4,I like I get to save literally thousands of dollars for the same education I'd be receiving at a 4 year university. The professors are just as good and my classes are not too big either. Only thing I would improve for the school is the wifi since it is at times extremely poor.
Sophomore,4,My academic advisor Bridget Kelly is absolutely amazing. She has gone above and beyond to help me throughout so many years even when I've struggled immensely. She knows that I have to bring my daughter in with me every time when I discuss my classes and she even bought toys my daughter
Freshman,4,"It's a great school! I love the community college atmosphere. Small classrooms, close distance to home, and cheaper tuition are all reasons that I love ICC!"
Sophomore,4,"I have enjoyed my time here at ICC. I’m glad I chose to go to a junior college before going to a university. It has saved me tremendously, and I owe nothing in regards to student loans. However, I also stayed in the campus housing which has been a nightmare. I absolutely hate it, and I will never recommend it to anyone. It’s more worth it to stay at home with my parents"
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Illinois Central College was a good experience. Although it is cheaper to go to ICC, the education provided is of expensive quality. ICC supplied me with a scholarship that covered the cost of my tuition, on-campus living, and books. The only thing I disliked about Illinois Central College is that sometimes it can be disorganized."
Freshman,4,Illinois Central College is well establish community college. The tuition is something that it is well known for because it is fairly low. Even though tuition is low does not mean the quality is bad. They have many different classes for many different majors and are actively helping you to further your future in the career you want to peruse. The professors are wonderful and are great at what they do. They understand and help as much as they can to further your education. Everyone is very friendly and there is always little to no problems on this campus. The campus does have housing but mostly local students attend. Which is great to know you will not be alone on this adventure. The athletics are amazing with winning teams and a great athletic facilities. I highly recommend attending Illinois Central College for the first two years of your experience because it not only saves you money but it also transitions you into college life.
Freshman,4,Classrooms are easy to find. All within one building. Do not have to travel very far. Staff is friendly. It is very close to home. Small classrooms. More one on one with teaching staff.
Freshman,4,"It is a very good start and place to get your general education courses! However, compared to my tough high school classes, some of the classes seem a little too easy and are not challenging enough for me in particular."
Sophomore,4,I like the ease of registering for classes and the willingness of instructors to help students outside of class.
Alum,4,Most of my professors were incredibly helpful and the smaller class sizes made learning much more efficient because we could focus on what topics the majority of the class was struggling with.
Freshman,4,"Illinois Central College is abundant with resources for success. The campus is teeming with student tutors and labs for supplemental help in every subject. The only way to fail a class here is to completely avoid utilizing the on-site and online services that are available every day. Some of the best teachers that I've met in my life teach here, and I've gotten help from my first year English teacher on scholarship applications and cover letters alike.
Tuition costs are comparably forgiving, but if you want to eat on campus, you're you're in for quite a bill- as is the case at any college. On-campus jobs are in high demand, so don't expect to land a position unless you're especially qualified or on the ball about applications. Don't let that discourage you, because ICC is just a short bus ride away from three different strip malls that are always looking for part time workers."
Alum,4,"Illinois Central College is a excellent affordable way to earn credits or an associates degree. ICC, for short, is  a small campus with mostly locally commuting students with a reputation for being the best school in its price range. ICC offers some amazing programs and top notch teachers that make the material simple and easy to follow. ICC also has some outstanding tech programs that rival the larger school for a fraction of the price."
Freshman,4,The professors are very well qualified and very understanding. The students are diverse but just enough where you have plenty to relate to. Overalls good experience and a good first step for freshman that aren't quite ready for the four year university scene.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not a huge fan of campus but I defiantly enjoy the fact that I am saving money, can get the help I need, and my professors for my career have helped me tremendously!"
College Sophomore,4,My core subjects were a hit or miss. A lot of great professors but I will say the professors teaching the specifics for my career are phenomenal! I am a multimedia associates and I've learned more in the past year than I've ever know before! They are incredible over in that department.
College Sophomore,4,"i would compare ICC to the shallow end of the pool. Rather than going straight to a four year university and getting thrown in the deep end with no floaties, ICC was a great school to slowly dip your toes in and exsperienced college life in less extremes. Don't get me wrong my classes were defiantly challenging but I felt more comfortable than I would have being in a far of university not knowing anyone. It's a great school to get started in for sure!"
College Junior,4,My instructors are very helpful
College Junior,4,"Great opportunities to make ""connections"" with those already in my field"
College Junior,4,Great program!  Love my instructors.
College Junior,4,"The online platform at Illinois Central College is a totally different experience than the classroom. I have found that some of the courses have been extremely difficult due to the level of interaction the instructor required from his/her students. It was helpful to have all of the assignments, reminders, and grades all in one place."
College Junior,4,The classroom experience has been very beneficial for my growth as a student. The class size is small enough for the teachers to invest personally with students when needed and allows for students to interact casually.
College Junior,4,"Illinois Central College is a good school to transition from high school to college. It has helped me afford my classes, stay at home, and work 20 hours a week while also receiving a good quality education."
College Sophomore,4,Online courses at ICC are designed to make learning and completing courses easier and more convenient. The professors also make it very easy to navigate and help you if there are any concerns
College Sophomore,4,"Between the teachers who would bend over backwards to lend you a hand and the amazingly affordable classes and tuition, there isn't one thing for me to complain about. The teachers were very well educated and did a great job getting the lecture across to the students, since there were only usually about twenty kids per class. The programs and technology was very hands on and easy to learn and use, and the students attending ICC were very happy and of all ages, because it is a school meant to get you started or back on your feet, which it did a very good job at."
College Sophomore,4,"ICC was definitely one of the best decisions of my life. This school really helped me through easy access with teacher for help and feedback. Also, ICC was very affordable and the education was very hands on and easy to learn as well. The biggest thing this school did for me was help me figure out what I wanted to do with my life, which is studying Economics for my bachelors and one day using my degree in business."
Junior,2,Place seems poorly put together. Difficult to get a clear picture of what is needed to get a degree. I had to jump through a lot of hoops to get into my current program.
College Sophomore,2,"The professors really don't care. There have been a few great ones but most just seem like they couldn't get a job at a real university and landed in the lap of ICC. On the plus side, they really don't care so some classes are extremely easy."
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't an alumni network and there are definitely not employers recruiting on campus. You're pretty much on your own.
College Junior,2,"There are so many people going into this field right now, but literally every single major specific class is exclusively online and it sucks major."
College Freshman,2,"My tuition was minor, $2,000 dollars, but money isn't always the easiest to come by. I ended up getting a loan for $3,500 and then a $1,000 dollar scholarship. I'm hoping my work will be able to cover the loan."
College Freshman,2,"Most of the students who come to this school either have no idea what they want to do with their lives, or are late in life college goers. They aren't very career oriented and many are there just so that their parents do not kick them out of their home. Granted, there are a few people there that go due to a financial hardship and do actually care about their academics, but they are few and far between."
College Freshman,2,"The tests were impractical and tested you over the things that were irrelevant to the course. I ended the class with a slight understanding of the underlying facts of nutrition, but it was hard to remember the small, minute, word for word details the software required you to remember. I had such vague questions, such as ___ is high, then ____."
College Senior,2,"The only computer lab is located in the library, the wifi access is bad, printing now costs money"
College Senior,2,"The computer labs are not very modern, with extremely limited on campus printing"
College Student,2,I wouldn't say its bad but they don't deserve average. I wish I had someone to talk to with about my career path.
College Junior,2,I haven't had the best experience with online courses. It's definitely harder than a classroom experience because you don't have that interaction with other students and the professor. It's also more time consuming and sometimes harder to get in contact with the professor.
College Junior,2,It's sort of hard to get through to financial aid but they try their best to give you the help you need.
College Senior,2,The online courses at ICC are very difficult to keep up with. Sometimes you do not know what you are getting in the class and you are not warned early enough to know when certain things are due.
College Senior,2,Illinois Central College is more of a commercial school than anything. All the students there just commute there for school and then when they are done with their classes they leave to go back home and do what they want. People that go to Illinois Central College usually stick with their same  friend group as they had in high school and dont really branch out as much. The main priority of the student body at ICC is mainly to go there and get done with your classes for that day and then go back home.
College Senior,2,there are many chances to recieve financial aid at school but the process of recieveing the help is hard to figure out what needs to be done and gathered.
College Senior,2,Professors constantly cancel class and I question the determination of the teachers.  The coursework is relatively easy and I'm not sure how well this school is preparing me for further education
College Freshman,2,"I cannot apply for a career here at ICC due to regulations that since I am a full time student, I cannont work full time, this causes undue hardships."
College Senior,2,"I like that my other classes kept my grades and assignments current on Blackboard, but my communications instructor did not use a computer and it was very hard to determine expectations for the course or how I was doing academically."
College Sophomore,2,"Motorcycle Class – A motorcycle class is offered at ICC. It isn't by them, but it's nice to take it close by. Only $20.00"
College Sophomore,2,"Career Center Is Disappointing – The career center is disappointing. I tried to find a job through the career center only to be told that there was nothing available and I couldn't be helped. When I started I was told job openings in my career were posted from time to time, but I haven't seen any in the 2 years that I've been there."
College Sophomore,1,Illinois Central College is the Toby Flenderson to my Michael Scott.
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you're going into nursing and being set up with the OSF program, you wont get much help finding job prospects from ICC."
College Sophomore,1,There is very little concentration on majors. Pretty much everyone is forced into taking Gen Eds.
College Sophomore,1,"The only decent factor about this institution is the price, but then again, you get what you pay for. Going here was a terrible decision on my part. It is basically like going to a high school where the professors don't care, you learn next to nothing, and normal people are few and far between. Bottom line: if you have the financial means to go to a four year university DO NOT COME HERE! Don't spend the next two years of what could be an awesome college experience in this depressing dump."
College Junior,1,I took my first two online classes last semester for my major and ended up failing both of them. There were over 30 people in one of those classes and it wasn't offered in person.
College Freshman,1,Very diverse and stupid. I have seen some of the dumbest people ever at this school
College Sophomore,1,I have been paying out of my pocket because I can never get straight answers from the financial aid department. I have even talked with the head of financial services. I have been told one thing I have to do then told it wasn't correct. I asked them a simple question about grants and the completely ignored my question to talk about something completely off topic.
Recent Alumnus,1,Teachers who earned their Ph.D's online and have the undeserved ego of an Ivy League professor coupled with the untrained housewives ICC employs as their staff and housekeeping make this campus every bit as lackluster as the experience they provide. I wish I had spent my money to go to a school with professionals instead of these jokes of education.
College Sophomore,1,"I came into college thinking that I would be able to make payments on tuition....wrong. I can only make 3 payments. I also thought that I would qualify for financial aid....wrong. My parents ""made too much"" and I wasn't 24 yet, or pregnant, or married. I bought my own house when i was 19...pretty sure i should be able to use my own tax information!!! Scholarships are hard to come by unless you are entering the medical field or have a child."
College Senior,1,No Choice – not being an athlete i can not say much about what it is like for those who play for the sports teams. but as just a regular student there is really nothing unique about this place.  The large reason why anyone actually goes there is because it is the only school in the area.  everything else is pretty far away
College Sophomore,1,"DONT GO HERE – The school has terrible programs, and the advisors don't really know what they're doing"
College Sophomore,1,"Class Offerings Limited – Plan on the basic traditional classes, nothing too progressive here."
College Freshman,1,"Just Like High School – Most of the students are local, right out of high school so all the high school clicks are still in place.  It is hard to make new friends."
College Freshman,1,Too Much Like High School – I don't like that it is an extension of high school.  There are mostly local students so the groups from high school of friends are still intact in college.  It is hard to make new friends.

Junior,5,The online course have been really easy to navigate through without having to ask how to find stuff. Its sequentially listed in modules how to go through the weeks work. They also have it set up where you can be geographically anywhere and apply your current environment to the course! This works for me as a non traditional student who is starting college late with kids.
Sophomore,5,"My experience with OSU so far has been amazing, I have had the time of my life since my first week of attending. Despite all the restrictions with COVID and the irregularity of everything, I have still done nothing but enjoy my experience. Go Beavs!!!"
Freshman,5,"Overall it has been an amazing experience, I wouldn't trade it for anything. The campus life is amazing!"
Freshman,5,At first i was skeptical about it but now that things are in full swing I have adjusted really well to online learning and its going good!
Senior,5,"I like the buildings at Oregon State University. Many Universities have more modern buildings and that takes away from the character of the area. The professors push me to better myself, and the professors teachings are educational."
Senior,5,I like online courses because I have the flexibility to work from the comfort of my home. I do not feel as pressured to get assignments done as when I went to classes in person. With Covid I do not take classes in person.
Junior,5,"I am involved with the E-Campus section of Oregon State University. I have felt included and welcome every step of the way. My professors have all been wonderful, and they (along with my advisors) have always been exceptionally helpful and easily accessible whenever I have questions. The financial aid office and tech support are also generally helpful and quick to respond. I would suggest OSU to anyone looking for an online degree. The varieties of ways to take proctored exams is nice, as they allow proctors in your area (and they help you find them) or ProctorU, a way to take proctored tests online."

Senior,5,Oregon State University has provided me with everything that I have needed to complete my college experience as necessary plus some!
Senior,5,"Due to Covid-19, all classes had to be online for the spring 2020 term. That was an extremely difficult challenge. However, OSU, the professors, and the teachers assistants handled it extremely well."
Sophomore,5,I only took online courses because of the pandemic but overall I like to think it is a little better than in person classes because you get the opportunity to connect with your instructor and classmates  in a way that is a little difficult to do in person.
Sophomore,5,i liked how safe and interesting it is. I liked being able to make new friends and hangout with people all around campus while also studying and doing well in my classes.
Graduate Student,5,"I have been admitted to the online program through the eCampus, but would have had the opportunity to take in person classes through the university transfer program and take classes through Portland State, University of Oregon, OSU, etc. I would have liked to take a few classes in person and transfer the credits in but the pandemic has prevented that from happening. However, I believe that the quality of the education online has been on par, if not better with in person education. I can complete the same curriculum at my own pace and in my own home, with the knowledge that I will get the same degree as an in person program and will have the same opportunities presented in my future. Overall online has been a great way to get an education and I have already recommended to a colleague."
Senior,5,"I am a full time student, and full time employee.  The online course load works well with my personal and professional life.  Tuition rates are comparable to in state rates where I live for a degree program that I am excied to pursue."
Senior,5,"I take strictly online courses as I live in New Jersey.  The flexibility of the courses is very convenient to working full time in addition to being enrolled as a student.  The professors have always been available for assistance that is needed, provide prompt feedback on grades and are super thorough with their outlines for the courses.  I couldn't be happier to have choosen OSU as my college to pursue the completion of my bachelor's degree in fisheries and wildlife."
Junior,5,Easy to apply. Easy to get into courses. Staff is well educated and helpful. opportunities for scholarships and grants.
Alum,5,"Overall, OSU has very well adapted online courses with utilization of technology and canvas to allow a relatively smooth transition into remote teaching."
Junior,5,"Unfortunately I have not taken any classes online, however professors regularly utilize things like canvas in order to make remote learning a lot easier."
Junior,5,"I have had an amazing time at Oregon State. While I have only attended this semester I still have been able to make meaningful connections here in corvallis. The teachers are phenomenal and genuinely care about the well being of their students. And my peers are all so friendly and are very helpful and fun to be around. All in all, there's a great atmosphere here in Oregon and I don't think I'd want it any other way. 

GO BEAVS!!"
Alum,5,"Very well organized, smooth and very great classes/teachers. Was using blackboard then switched to Canvas which was difficult to get used to but doesn't reflect the school itself. Teachers are usually really helpful even in an online learning environment. I only recommend online learning for classes that you can be pretty independent on though."

Junior,5,"The online learning experience is awesome. I get all the help I need, and professors are always willing to video chat to offer any assistance. It's easier that I expected. I get treated like I would on campus."
Junior,5,"I love the people, especially the staff. The professors are great and very helpful. I  also love the diversity of the classes offered."
Sophomore,5,Top notch online learning platform. The school really makes an investment in the students online learning experience.
Sophomore,5,They were prompt in the application process. They made the registration process smooth and easy. I am proud to be a part of an amazing university!
Senior,5,"I like the wide variety of courses offered at OSU, both on campus and ecampus.  There is a lot of flexibility and everyone is nice and genuinely wants to see you succeed."
Senior,5,The professors do their best to give online students the same or similar experiences to campus students.  For science  classes involving labs they even send the student lab kits so they can perform the lab their own way.
Sophomore,5,"Just like the on campus learning its similar, but i liked it more because less moving around. For better and for worse"
Junior,5,I always feel supported and the education is excellent. I couldn't ask for a better advisor and my professors are great.
Junior,5,I always feel supported and the education is excellent. I couldn't ask for a better advisor and my professors are great.
Junior,5,"I am a OSU online computer science student. This postbacc program is a great way for those with non-CS backgrounds to break into tech. The professors are easily accessible on Piazza and via email as are the TAs. The cost of the degree is just under $30k, and most of it can be paid for with student loans. The program can be completed in 1-2 years depending on your work schedule. The intro classes are taught in Python which is a great beginner language. Because this program is online, you can complete it from anywhere. All you need is a laptop and a whiteboard. Highly recommend!"
Alum,5,"Oregon State University has strong academic programs with professors who truly care about your growth and development. There is plenty of research opportunities to pursue, and professors in these fields put in the effort and the mentorship for you to achieve your goals. I would like to see more focus on student engagement - a lot of clubs are listed, but few of them actually hold events that encourage social engagement between students. Additionally, more focus could be spent on renovating older, unsafe buildings, rather than funneling  money toward athletic facilities."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Oregon state itâ€™s the perfect mixture of a big school in a small town it feels like the whole city or Corvallis is part of the campus. The campus is large and not all on top of each other with beautiful buildings and scenery. The faculty and student body is great and there are so many opportunities at this university such as IM sports, Greek life, clubs and organizations, honor societies, work opportunities. The dorms are nice the library is beautiful and Dixon rec center is fantastic."
Senior,5,The ECampus was well established.  The application and registration process was easy to navigate.  There was a multitude of courses to choose from and never found that classes were unavailable.
Senior,5,"OSU made online learning very easy, which works well for me as a student who lives away from campus and works full-time."
Junior,5,The campus is beautiful and the overall atmosphere is welcoming and exciting. The athletics are one of the main forms of entertainment throughout the school year as well as the hundreds of clubs and activities that go on throughout the year.
Junior,5,Oregon state opens up a lot of opportunities. Online classes provide a comfortable way to fit school into your busy schedule. Professors and success coaches are great at making the whole process smooth.
Senior,5,"I really enjoyed the community that Oregon State University was able to provide.  Additionally, OSU has a beautiful campus!"
Junior,5,I love how helpful the advisors and offices are! The majority of professors are wonderful and communicate quickly. The tools available make it easy to figure out what your degree requires and what classes fulfill different requirements. The only thing I would change is the tuition cost.
Alum,5,"Graduated from here a while ago but it was an experience that will stay with me throughout my life. The community, the diversity of ideas, the idyllic campus in a gorgeous college town. This place has everything you could ever want in a university. GO BEAVS!"
Junior,5,"I'm a part of the e-campus school, and so far my experience has been great. 
Huge selection of classes so I don't get bored. We'll see how registration goes!
Extreme care and support shown by the staff. It's easy to apply, and in order to finish your enrollment, you have to meet with both a success coach AND an academic advisor. They also have a community for the online students so they do not feel as lonely
Only complaint is that a lot of their scholarships exclude the online students, which in my opinion isn't very fair. But I guess that's life!"
Senior,5,I really enjoy Oregon State University. The university offers several things for its students including their online students. The classes are great and so are the instructors.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Oregon State University. Oregon State has been extremely patient and helpful to their incoming freshman during this crazy time
Alum,5,"My 4 years at OSU were memorable. The college campus feel and atmosphere made it feel like I was home. Everything was walking/biking distance and was easily accessible. I really enjoyed game days for football at OSU. Everywhere you went, you would here a ""go beavs"" and be surrounded by friendly people."
Senior,5,"I am currently an Ecampus student at Oregon State University in the Fisheries and Wildlife Science Program. Not only is the Program set up for me to easily work with my schedule, but there are tons of great resources and people willing to help if there is a need."
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus, great location and great majors.  I like that it is mild climate.  I also like how close it is to the Portland Airport and I-5.  I also like how they offer students free computer and bike repair."
Niche User,5,Just an overall decent college; has a great program for mechanical engineering. Campus is nice and all the professors are very helpful. All classes are super engaging.
Graduate Student,5,I was in the Animal Sciences program and I felt that professors and advisers alike all cared about me and wanted me to succeed. There were many opportunities for me to grow and further my career.
Freshman,5,"Wow, what a welcoming environment for sure. Everyone here really makes new incoming freshman feel as if they truly are a part of a family/community. The academic opportunities here are great and I am truly glad I chose to go here."
Niche User,5,It had a very good campus and environment. I like the classes they have and the people that go there
Freshman,5,OSU has a beautiful campus and excellent resources. The community is very nice and the professors I had so far were great.
Niche User,5,Oregon State is in the small but very great community in the middle of Oregon. Not a big city like POrtland but still not a blink of a eye you miss it in the middle of nowhere town either.
Junior,5,I like the program options that they offer. I was able to choose the program that best fit my career goals. I wouldn't change anything.
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus, accepting community, eco-friendly environment, abundance of study services, varied campus events"
Sophomore,5,Oregon State has given me a whole new perspective on college life through schooling and the environment. The faculty strives to help you succeed and there are endless opportunities to make new friends.
Junior,5,I love how compact and beautiful the campus is. Most places in Corvallis are very close to the campus and it provides anyone with a sense of community. While you are required to spend your first year in the dorms I've met some of my best friends through it.
Freshman,5,"I love the experience Oregon State University has offered me. I received my first job here and have been introduced into such a caring environment. I truly have never been surrounded anywhere else in my life with so many caring and supportive students, friends, and faculty members. The atmosphere of the campus is amazing and there is always something to do on campus, whether it be a clubs, intramural sports, a wide variety of recreational sports, or a scenic bike ride on the beautiful campus. I've never regretted attending Oregon State University."
Freshman,5,"I definitely think I made the right choice by choosing to attend OSU. As a prospective engineering major from Hawaii, I wanted a strong engineering school with a good sense of community, and a campus that wasn't too overwhelming yet still had lots of opportunity. OSU ended up being the perfect fit for me."
Senior,5,"Oregon state's academics sport a wide range of subjects and includes specific specialties that will fulfill everybody's dreams and future goals. Oregon state does not just stop in the classroom, but takes the class outside. From their gardens and local farm animals to their coastal adventures on their research vessel, Oregon State students make their own cheese and collect their own data. The campus caters to all walks of life with an ethnic centers, vegan cafes and inclusive atmosphere."
Junior,5,OSU has a very diverse community; you will be able to find a group that shares the same values as you. The majority of the people here are very open-minded and helpful.
Junior,4,"I like how the programs are very geared towards getting me employed when I'm graduated. They have internship requirements that forced me out of my comfort zone to immerse myself into the profession I am seeking to get into. This was valuable for me because it was an early opportunity to change my mind. (I didn't but some might) I think the colleges curriculum is really career focused while requiring the same academic standards I'd get at near by university's. 
The campus itself is very modern. The admissions process also seemed very inclusive and being on campus I feel comfortable walking around. I am not a traditional or average college student so its important to me to be comfortable going to school and I get that here where at nearby schools I would singled out."
Sophomore,4,"Before the pandemic I took once class a term online. Now, all of my classes are online whether they are synchronous or not. However, the experience hasn't been that bad and the majority of them are going super smooth."
Junior,4,"Like any community college or university currently, remote classes are being offered to try and mimic the experience of a convention lecture-based course. There are downsides, and I would say most students prefer in-person classes over online, which is why many students are deciding to take a year off until COVID settles down to maximize their experience in college."
Junior,4,"I love how Oregon State University has so many resources for everyone who's interested in being involved with their school. They offer clubs, sports, social events, and much more to ensure student success. The one caveat is that so many clubs and programs cause students to have to pay very high fees. Ex. $400 fee to go towards programs and services at OSU each term."
Freshman,4,"I learned quite  a bit, although it is a massive campus each of your classes are split up with one day lecture and the next in a more intimate setting with a grad student."
Freshman,4,"I met some of the most amazing people and would have loved to stay on this campus if it were not for out of state tuition. The recreation center is absolutely amazing as well as the dining areas. I learned quite  a bit, although it is a massive campus each of your classes are split up with one day lecture and the next in a more intimate setting with a grad student."
Graduate Student,4,"I have been very impressed with my experience thus far. I think the curriculum could be better molded to the needs of the student, but overall have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Oregon State and will likely continue to enjoy it through the remainder of my time in the program. I would absolutely recommend this program to a friend or a colleague"
Junior,4,Classes online are easy to follow. Can receive additional help from peers and professor if needed. ONID portal very user friendly.
Alum,4,"The campus is beautiful and most of my professors were amazing. There was plenty of extra curricular opportunities including ministries, the craft center, and clubs that I joined. My only criticism is that some professors involved too many of their own opinions into lectures."
Junior,4,"I have yet to begin classes at OSU. I was supposed to start over the summer, but due to COVID, I deferred until the fall and have overall been extremely impressed with the staff in getting started in such an unprecedented time."
Sophomore,4,The classes moved over swiftly to online for spring quarter and it felt smooth. I still felt as though I had every opportunity to learn like in person courses.
Sophomore,4,Oregon state University has a very friendly campus that seems to welcome everyone. I am glad to have chosen this university and there are many opportunities!
Freshman,4,"I have not yet attended this college, but i start in the fall of 2020. The academic advisors are really nice and help you a ton with everything you need to know about going to college, so that is a plus. I like that. One thing i dont like very much with dealing with getting ready for college is the financial aid office faculty. They dont seem to have any answers or help much."
Sophomore,4,"Its a nice place, and probably is better than any other college in Oregon, but the entire college is fairly broken, with outrageous food prices (when they claim great food prices) and the teachers usually arent very good with teaching, but the TAs are amazing"
Junior,4,"I am a OSU online computer science student. This postbacc program is a great way for those with non-CS backgrounds to break into tech. The professors are easily accessible on Piazza and via email as are the TAs. The cost of the degree is just under $30k, and most of it can be paid for with student loans. The program can be completed in 1-2 years depending on your work schedule. The intro classes are taught in Python which is a great beginner language. Because this program is online, you can complete it from anywhere. All you need is a laptop and a whiteboard. Highly recommend!"
Sophomore,4,"Oregon State Ecampus is one of the top 10 online learning campuses in the country, as well as has the best liberal arts online program in the country. I am majoring in psychology and sociology with minors in french and women's, gender & sexuality studies (so I am VERY liberal arts). It has been wonderful and easy to navigate"
Sophomore,4,"I feel that the financial aid help is weak at Oregon State, but I love the Beavers and the on-campus experience was one of the best experiences of my life. I was involved in the honors college and I made a ton of life long friends. My dorm was really nice, as far as dorms go, especially at Oregon State. My roommate and I lucked out with a larger dorm, a private bathroom, and in the Honors dorms- all for less than some of the more expensive dorms, as well as the educational aspect was fulfilling. The food was also pretty good, especially for the price, very affordable and always accessible."
Junior,4,"Great campus layout. The school is a decent blend of old and new architecture and hosts a wide variety of majors with excellent engineering, health, and business fields of study."
Junior,4,"I currently take online classes due to COVID-19. Many of the professors have done well making the transition to using the ZOOM software to teach lectures. Overall, the online experience is not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. OSU is doing a good job at delivering online classes."
Alum,4,"I took a few classes online. Online classes are professor dependent - some are very organized and deliver content in a way that allows you to learn. Other courses are poorly organized courses that have clearly been reused (incorrect assignment dates, out of date material). All online courses are heavily discussion board based."
Freshman,4,"Good range of classes. Lots of on campus activities, although I don't go to many. Free ticket to athletic events encourages students to attend."
Senior,4,"Oregon State is a beautiful campus, with lists of opportunities for student engagement and undergraduate research. I feel very connected to the school and those Iâ€™ve met there. However, they sometimes miss the mark on student communication and allocate theyâ€™re funds to places that donâ€™t  always benefit students. Itâ€™d be nice to see some of the administrators and coaches take a price decrease and the cut of funds to pointless merch purchases so they could instead fix aging buildings and fund scholarships."
Senior,4,"Iâ€™d been taking online classes before covid19 so I didnâ€™t have as big of a learning curve as some. Out of state students receive instate tuition for online classes which is very helpful. I canâ€™t say how good or bad theyâ€™re classes are via zoom or remote delivery. I think Iâ€™d have a hard time learning on zoom, but online through canvas isnâ€™t bad."
Sophomore,4,"This is one thing I think OSU has done fairly well with. While every quick and large change has its bugs, I do think that they have handled it to the best of their ability and I haven't hd many issues. I honestly would take online courses for the rest of my degree if they were cheaper. It is much more convent though a little more challenging in terms of work load. Many of my instructors are assigning all group projects, homework, and class work as well as live zoom lectures. I think it is assumed we have all the time in the world so thing tend to get pretty busy and a little overwhelming. However, I feel less stressed than I do when I am taking in person courses. I wouldn't be upset if we stayed online for fall term."
Freshman,4,"This school is great meaning the community is a very positive environment and the majority of my professors have been very understanding and want to actually teach their students. However, with so many students the faculty is really hard to get in touch with which is why I gave them four starts but overall a great school and a positive and welcoming environment."
Freshman,4,It's a very big school. I just hope they add a nursing school in the future. It hurts to see how the dining plan can be somewhat expensive.
Sophomore,4,"Located in a small town but it makes for an amazing college experience. I think that the school is amazing for many reasons. The one bad thing about the school is the tuition cost, especially for out of state students."
Sophomore,4,"Professors keep the same dedication to students by providing a great online experience. I have taken many online classes and I don't think there is a lack in learning, as long as you are dedicated."
Sophomore,4,"I transferred to Oregon State university in the fall of 2019.  I have really enjoyed walking through campus and attending my classes. I have ran into problems with academic advising, and parking. Not providing any free parking on or near campus makes it very difficult for those who can not afford a parking permit for the year."
Sophomore,4,I LOVE LOVE LOVE OSU!!!! The only flaw are the prices!!!! As a low income student it is so hard to pay for school. I didn't get any scholarships and I cant take out any loans due to my parents bad credit (as expected being a low income student) Teachers and peers are amazing!!
Freshman,4,"What I like about this university in particularly the teachers and students that are there. You can fell the joy, caring for on another. The variety of clubs and supports that they offer. The only thing I will like to change would be color of the building. I get really confused which building is the right one. They all look the same."
Senior,4,"Oregon State is a great university. Each program strives for the success of each of its students, and each resource both on and off campus provides students with the tools they need for greatness."
Junior,4,"There is a lot of resources and a lot of people willing to help people succeed. However, I think it's not really fair that people taking online classes have to pay more money to use resused lesson plans that are usually years old and half the time the due dates to assigments don't get updated for a few weeks. The students in online classes are having to do a lot more of the work themselves, but yet have to pay more money."
Alum,4,"I loved living in Corvallis, it is such an awesome college town. The school has a beautiful campus and is located just 3 hours from the mountains and 1 hour from the coast. And the campus is beautiful and has fantastic facilities. I really couldn't imaging having going anywhere else for my undergrad."
Freshman,4,"This university is great. It's on a beautiful campus with great resources for students. The fact that the university is large can make it difficult for off-campus students to find a niche, but it's easy to make friends in classes because everybody is very friendly."
Niche User,4,"Oregon State's campus is beautiful, the trees are gorgeous in the fall. Though, Corvallis is really far out there and there is not much to do outside of campus."
Niche User,4,"The main reason why I was at Oregon State University was because I was invited to go to a soccer camp there and I was interested in their program. When, I got to the campus, I really liked the area because it was so green and the weather was nice and chilly. It was also good that the campus was isolated and not in the areas like Portland; the area was more localized and had a few small neighborhoods and shops around the campus. Overall, being there for soccer and to check out the place was a great experience."
Senior,4,"I really like the focus of study and the variety of offered majors. They are very environmentally focused, which aligns with my own life. The teachers are great, and the online platform is thorough."
Senior,4,I think that Oregon State is a great university. One of my favorite things about it is the campus. It is beautiful and a great place to walk around and explore between classes. I also really like the community of the university.
Senior,4,"Oregon State University is overall a good learning environment with many resources available for student success. You will definitely like some professors more than others and they could improve their dining hall food, however the campus is beautiful and I enjoyed getting my degree at this university."
Junior,4,"I am an online student at Oregon State University. I appreciate the variety of online classes and most of them have been really good, though there have been a few exceptions."
Niche User,4,"I am an incoming college freshman. When I needed help with my application, the admissions office was very kind and helpful. They answered all of my questions to make sure I can easily navigate the college application. My cousin attends Oregon State University, and she is always talking about how lovely it is there, which made applying to OSU very exciting."
Junior,4,I'm a non-traditional transfer student that is determined to get a four year degree in business.  I moved from California to go to Oregon State University (OSU) and be near my aging parents (who retired to Oregon 5 years ago). It's taken me until I reached 25 years old to start full-time college and I'm excited and challenged every day to be at OSU.
Senior,4,"I have loved my time at Oregon State. Some of the courses were structured in confusing ways in the college of science, but overall the professors were understanding and engaging. The campus is extremely convenient to get around and there is enough to do outside of campus to keep you occupied for the four years you're here."
Niche User,4,"Oregon State University, is a nice place to be at. Campus is amazing, food is amazing but expensive. Dorms are small but very nice. Farthest distance walking is not more than 5 miles. Nice atmosphere, and their park/stadium are the most noticeable features."
Freshman,4,"Not a whole lot to do around Corvallis unless you look really hard, but very great engineering program! Science based engineering professors are realistic about what you need to know, and care about your education path."
Sophomore,4,Oregon State has a great campus environment for STEM students and has the resources to devote to further our educations.
Senior,4,"A place surrounding by most beautiful trees. A forest of over 2000 Acres located 20 mins away from campus has provided me the opportunity to get out and explore my career path in ways that I wouldn't be able to find elsewhere. Campus is isolated and provides students a getaway. You know you are on campus at Oregon State. Its lovely. Beautiful buildings surrounded by the most exotic trees provides an easy time simply hanging around OSU. Courtyards to Quads, this school has it all. Classes are tough at times which is to be expected but all in all a rewarding experience for anyone who dares to enter of DAM at Oregon State University."
Sophomore,4,"It's a great school with tons of resources and classes to find something that fits your interests. There are tons of people there that you will form lifelong connections with, along with professors who are helpful and nice. The campus is extremely beautiful and clean, and nice to walk around."
Freshman,4,I really like the community I have made at Oregon State University. I have made a lot of new friends who I would have never met had I not came to OSU. Oregon State has also helped me become more hard working with its rigorous class schedule and has helped me understand the importance of hard work in and outside of the classroom. Also OSU offers a lot of fun clubs and other organizations which have been really accepting and have made me feel right at home in Corvallis. Probably the only thing I would change about OSU is that some of my teachers had difficulty teaching their subjects but this is a pretty rare problem that I didn't experience a whole lot.
Senior,4,"Very strong science program. Involved faculty that take an interest in their students. Campus is beautiful and the town has some of the friendliest residents. There are so many resources available on campus and ways to get involved and find a community,"
Niche User,4,"Really good community and a nice campus.  All teachers and workers are very kind. Good food on campus, nice food court. Dorms are small but nice and are good are pairing you with good roomates."
Freshman,4,So far it's been good! I am dual enrolled with LBCC and that has proven to be a little bit of a struggle as it seems that the two schools don't communicate but I'm working it out. OSU has a beautiful campus and the professors are friendly and caring about the students.
Niche User,4,"During my visit to Oregon State University, I toured the campus and learned so much about the school and all that they had to offer. The representatives of the college seemed very helpful as they were there to answer all the questions that I had. I would recommend anyone to go there and check it out."
Senior,4,Oregon State is a great school. it has a lot of student resources and opportunities for students to get involved and be a part of the community.
Junior,4,"OSU is pretty great if you know where to go, but you just have to make sure you don't get swallowed up by the huge student body/campus."
Sophomore,4,"My experience has been a little limited so far. Due to me being a transfer student. Though, this does stop me from having experiences. The teachers I have talked to have all been very nice and helpful, the services here are great for anything you can think of and staff have been engaging. The campus is beautiful and active, on top of that it gives a good feeling of home."
Sophomore,4,"I like the atmosphere of community at OSU. Everybody knows that college can be hard, but having friends by your side to help you through it really helps."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is gorgeous and all the green is really refreshing. Lots of activities and clubs to supplement the extensive course offerings. Nearly all of the staff are fantastic and classes are better because of it. Administration is a piece of work, though."
Sophomore,4,My first year of college at OSU was definitely a learning experience. It helped me become more prepared for my sophomore and I hope that process keeps going until I graduate.
Senior,2,"If you are unfortunate enough to be living in Oregon when you are graduating high school, opt for a community college, or an east coast school. In Oregon, they like to give your money to the failing sports programs, and the repulsive greek life. OSU's student body culture boasts a pretentious urge to be accepting of minorities, yet pushes them to the outskirts of campus at all costs, while having little to no actual minority involvement. Most of the student life is dominated by exclusive and chauvinistic fratboys and sorority girls, who have simply chosen OSU to get their Mr. and Mrs. degrees, promptly drop out after a failed year at business school, and then stay around the heart of the valley in Oregon. These people are easy to find when they drop out, as they are often sporting ""Oregun"" stickers on their enormous vehicles, waving giant American flags, and attending republican rallies ornamented in Oregon State University clothing. Stay away from OSU if you can."
Senior,2,"OSU tried to squeeze every penny out of their students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and offered an awful compromise to classes. For my labs, I was putting water in the microwave and seeing how hot it got...or freezing water in a balloon. This is not college, and I do not feel prepared. I do feel as though I have no money and have no hope of getting any with this education."
Senior,2,"Decent selection of courses, most professors are pretentious pompous asses that are more concern with their own opinion as opposed to being open to student view points. Furthermore, professors seldom lead classes, it is usually grad students that treat all students as if they are beneath them and fail to remember who pays for the education."

Furthermore, professors seldom lead classes, it is usually grad students that treat all students as if they are beneath them and fail to remember who pays for the education."
Sophomore,2,"Although the campus, town, and surrounding areas are very beautiful, out-of-state tuition is ridiculously high, many students are very closed-minded towards differing points of view, many of the professors do not care about the success of their students, and the school requires several unnecessary credits."
Niche User,2,"I ended up transferring because I had repeated difficulty getting a spot in classes and it was putting me behind, plus wasting my time and tuition on classes I settled on. The advisors are aware of the problem but nothing they can do about it."
Senior,2,"This is about housing. There's a lot of pretty landscaping and buildings on campus but you are forced off after freshman year due to overcrowding. I loved my freshman year in the dorms but Corvallis stinks (truth it smells like farm animals on breezy days) Every neighbor I've had has been inconsiderate (parking, noise, trash) and the city does nothing. The police hate the students and lump us all together. You must start your housing search for the next year during fall term, and it's so expensive for what you get which is probably a dump. Everything is so run down once you leave campus and Corvallis is pretty remote. Your lease will be 12 months  (true at all schools) but there is nothing to do here on breaks and summer jobs are extremely competitive to get."
Freshman,2,"Socially OSU has been disappointing. It seems like everyone is from the Portland metro area and already know each other from high school, or at the very least are already a friend of a friend. If you're not into frats or sports there isn't much to get you engaged. Also expect some heat if you are socially progressive. The students I've talked to who claim to be liberal have conservative notions that come through in conversations. It's as if they think it's cool or required to be liberal. I have really enjoyed my classes so far, particularly chem lab.  So I hope the rest gets better."
Sophomore,2,My experience at OSU has been helpful in learning that i don't like the way they operate student academics. I arrived freshman year and spent that year hating dorm life explicitly and learning that I despised taking Chemistry here. I wasn't having much of a good college experience with OSU and joined the dual enrolled program that allowed me to take Linn-Benton Community College courses in Albany for OSU credit. I actually feel that Linn-Bentons program and class structure works much better than OSU's as the classes are smaller and more group learning. While at OSU it seems the professors just put a lot of information up on a power points and then expect you to really understand it all for the test. In the end I've decided to transfer colleges into a major i really wish to pursue but in a setting that i feel i can actually be taught in.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't have a high view of Greek life. From what it seems like, all they do is party."
College Sophomore,2,professors in certain classes really don't care about the students. It is obvious they are only there for the money.  They could not possibly care any less if you pass the class or not.
College Junior,2,"Greek life is certainly present on campus, though not as wide spread as at some other colleges"
College Sophomore,2,"Very clique-y, hard to make friends with people in it if you aren't."
College Sophomore,2,Value is horrible compared to space but hey it is close to class.
College Sophomore,2,It's a sad mockery of Greek Life elsewhere.
College Student,2,People do it all the time.
College Student,2,"I was not able to obtain enough funding to cover all aspects of school financial  demand, and there for i have to work a full time job along with going to school full time. This has made my grades suffer and also has put a huge amount of stress on me."
College Freshman,2,I am not part of it but I have friends who are. My fraternity member friends enjoy it and say rush was easy but I know for the sororities it's picky and according to a friend a lot of girls don't get what they want or drop entirely. Greek life is far too expensive for me.
College Junior,2,"The application process was great, but I disliked orientation. They rushed through class sign-ups to the point where I was in all the wrong classes first term."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are very cramped and not worth the value that the students are paying for them.  The heating systems don't work well, and there are a lot of damages to the walls of the dorms.  The bathrooms and kitchens are not cleaned very well and are gross to be in for long periods of times.  Not many people really talk and there aren't many things that get us involved."
College Junior,2,"There are always parties. Freshman get way too drunk, the dorms always smell like weed and alcohol. Best parties are on Greek Row, but most people know what Frats to not enter because they are known for stripping poles and sex."
College Junior,2,"My classes are always late at night, or I have extra work to do late at night. I have a guy with me at all times to ensure my safety because I don't know what the person walking behind me is thinking."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know anything about the party scene, I only know that the noise in the frat row can be bad for the surrounding area."
College Sophomore,2,I do not think this is the most exciting town for nightlife.
College Freshman,2,Living on campus is extremely expensive for what you get. You end up paying a lot of money to stay in these dorms that often are dirty and filled with rude drunk people.
College Freshman,2,My vehicle was broke into twice in 5 days.  The police really didn't seem to care.  And nothing has been done about it.
College Sophomore,2,"Eh, lots of drinking. From what I've experienced, if you're not into drinking, there really isn't that much to do on the weekends. There's a lot of marijuana smokers, but most aren't excessively open about it unless someone else mentions it first. Otherwise, as far as drugs go, I know that my roommate's boyfriend goes to parties and does a lot of cocaine. I'm sure that he's not the only one. 

It's just whatever, I guess."
College Junior,2,"I don't care for the athletics part of this school: this is a place to earn a degree and to prepare for a future, I feel like the school spends too much on athletics and overall it hurts the average student because the athletics are subsidized by increasing tuition."
College Freshman,2,"I don't like being forced to live on campus in order to attend this university. I don't feel it is a good environment for me, and it seems like the university is just trying to get the money from housing expenses rather than actually support their students."
College Junior,2,"The downfall of OSU Cascades is that the housing availability is poor. The city of Bend in general has a housing problem. Hopefully this issue gets resolved soon. That being said there are very large expensive homes that are rented out to college students, but there definitely needs to be more housing options available for students and the school should participate more in ensuring housing availability."
College Freshman,2,"Off campus housing is train wreck in Corvallis, just go one town over to Albany and you're set."
College Sophomore,2,"It's a simple process, but I did not receive nearly as much as I needed and I don't even qualify for any scholarships"
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, Corvallis is full of private landlords and property management that increase prices every year. There's limited parking and housing available in Corvallis. The housing is full of older development and not well maintain. If you want decent/good housing the pricing is ridiculous."
College Freshman,2,I only rate bad because I mostly ate at McNary. Most of the dining halls were to far to walk to when I was busy throughout the day. McNary had the worst food on campus and the hours were not convenient.
College Junior,2,"The pros of living of campus include that it is cheaper than the dorms, however it can be difficult to find anywhere close to campus without finding it almost a year in advance. Also, anything close to campus is ridiculously expensive and is mainly 5+ bedroom houses which is not ideal for me personally. Many of the houses around are not well kept as well. When I was searching for a place, the school was not super helpful. Mainly just recommended places which were out of my budget."
Recent Alumnus,2,still struggling with the financial aid process at OSU. I hope no one ever has to go through what i did
College Sophomore,2,Very difficult to get significant financial aid from the institution
College Senior,2,"I don't want to go back to the dorms. It was interesting the first year, but all in all I like having my own bathroom."
College Sophomore,2,"Many scholarships are available, if you are in the right department. The advertising for them is low and finding the applications is almost impossible on their website."
College Sophomore,2,Most off-campus dining is chain restaurants so there really isn't anything that special about going off-campus.
College Sophomore,2,Public transportation was not a strong suit for the school. I never used a bus as i was unsure the schedule. If you needed to get to the airport the only way to go was a friend or parking your car at airport parking. The best thing to get to and from campus was usually ride sharing.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking almost always seemed to be an issue, the on campus parking was usually full and required a parking pass to use, which had a fee. The dorm buildings have parking lots but are often full. The only area i've noticed with fairly consistant parking was the parking garage near the gym and baseball field, right next to Finley Hall, but even that wasn't a sure thing."
College Sophomore,2,"While filling out the fafsa i received a couple grants, scholarships were something i did not take advantage of."
College Freshman,2,"I don't really know much about it, I've tried to figure out the shuttle system but can't figure out where the stops are or the times. The bus is pretty good though."
College Student,2,"The rain in the winter can really get people down and cause seasonal depression. I would prefer to be somewhere that is more sunny, although I love OSU."
College Junior,2,"My particular program is excellent and unique in its design, but has failed in its implementation.  The faculty in my department is not adequate to support my graduate program."
College Freshman,2,"There is little public transportation, but most everything I need is in walking distance."
College Freshman,2,My major is ridiculous and I have to take a bunch of classes that have nothing to do with my major.
College Junior,2,Oregon in general is poor with diversity.
College Junior,2,Finding spots is an issue.
College Junior,2,Very few places to go after you turn 21.
College Sophomore,2,"Permit costs will skyrocket for next school year, ticketing and fines are strict, and the availability of parking spaces is poor. A car is not needed at all unless the individual lives more than a 15 minute walk away."
College Sophomore,2,"We do not stay on one subject. Instead, every term the material of the class is something different. Also, I do not find the  bacc core courses to be helpful at all. Rather it is a waste of time and money because it does not help with the program the students decide to be in."
College Sophomore,2,Off-campus housing is much cheaper and living-conditions are better than dorming. Parking for off-campus depends on location but most are street parking which is a hassle and cost is very high if a close housing is wanted.
College Freshman,2,wireless could be improved for better connectivity.
College Freshman,2,It feels like campus housing is a business for schools
College Sophomore,2,Parking on campus is expensive for students.
College Sophomore,2,If you like to drink and have no sexual standards then it's the best. Otherwise....
College Sophomore,2,It's not all that great. Looks are average. People are nice. IQ is basic.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are pretty tiny and ridiculously expensive. They really aren't worth the price that they are being charged for and are basically a complete rip off for the students. Dorms are mandatory for first year students and that's pretty unfair, especially for students that really don't want it and can't afford that on top of everything else they have to pay for."
Alum,1,This University was said to earn a graduate an opportunity for work at somewhere around 50k.  I graduated with a BA in computer science.  The University has been practically useless with respect to return.  Not to mention the culture online and with professors is generally ruthless.  They are looking for any reason to fail students.  Understandable since classes cost money.  I think there are better ways to prepare us for the future.  OSU has generally been a disappointment in my experience. I don't recommend you waste your time here.  I wish I would have spent my time and energy elsewhere.
Alum,1,I am a new grad and my experience was also terrible at this University.  It has essentially left me helpless in debt
Senior,1,"To start, My father died during finals week and consequently did not do very well on the final. I petitioned to make the class I didn't do well on to have it changed as W (withdraw) instead of a D. In order to have this done they wouldn't take my word for it and gave me a two week window to obtain a death certificate of my own father for a board to review and approve along with a written description of how my dad died and when. Secondly, many students live in the library and from house to house and are considered homeless because they do not give much financial aid to the low income students. Many students skip meals in order to afford paying tuition and rent with zero assistance from the school. These are the classes to avoid because the school makes more money from retakes then it does from first time students: Gen Chem 231,232,233. MTH 111,251,252. BI 21x. PHY. Take these classes at the community college near by. This college really likes money, bottom line is that it is a business"
Senior,1,Overall this online structure was better. Although the exams are only correct or wrong. The same classes on campus are striclty exam based while online included quiz points as well.
Freshman,1,Poorly structured. There is no way that a person can learn subjects well with this type of class setup.
Senior,1,"This school will not properly articulate transcripts leading to never ending registration issues. Advising is a waste of time, because they will not follow through with tasks that need to be accomplished for a student to determine exactly what course work is required of them. If you ask any status update questions, no one at the university will even respond to your emails. If you file a complaint, the resolution you receive is only a ""status"" update on the original problems and never an actual resolution. As a distance educational institution, the university has an obligation to respond to students in a timely manner, which they could care less about. Not even the Vice Provost would offer any assistance. Four business days have gone by since I should have been able to register for classes I need to graduate, and still nothing. Seek a legitimate institution that is in the business of providing education, not deceiving distance students out of their money."
Alum,1,"As a former alumnus, I wouldn't recommend this college for students of color. There are closeted white supremacists at OSU in positions of power and given the chance, that power is used to hurt minority students academically. I happen to be a victim. My advice to prospective students is to take your talents elsewhere, where it can grow without the worry of experiencing racism."
Alum,1,"To start, I was a transfer from a community college and did not experience a true freshmen year. I'm also former military and the reviews for this college I think depend on which school you attend. I was in the college of Chemical, Biological and Environmental Engineering and I can tell you I love my degree but would have gone anywhere else for it knowing now what I went through. Going down the list, only one advisor was worth talking to and only certain students could talk to that one but this has recently changed (after 4 years of complaints). There are some absolutely great faculty but a majority are disinterested, elitist (and one that is extremely sexist/racist). The overarching college has raised tuition every year with little appearing in the classroom and hearing how corrupt the council of the college is, that should not be surprising, My education was ok, I feel confident in most areas but am continuing my education to fill in the gaps."
Niche User,1,"Nothing but frustration with admissions office. I sent my ACT scores to six universities and OSU is the only one that can't seem to find it. I paid extra, and a rush fee, to have it sent a second time. If you can get someone on the phone it will no doubt be the wrong person. What a terrible first impression."
Freshman,1,"Not a good university. Poorly run classes with incompetent teachers, some of whom aren't even teachers just other students. They run their classes unethically; in my CS160 class they split us into two sections, one who studied coding theory and one who ACTUALLY coded which is messed up. After I uncovered the experiment I could feel my blood boiling. And all without our permission. Some dorm halls are probably good but mine sucked I had to walk 14 minutes to my first class. I was disappointed with how the college as a whole is run and DO NOT RECOMMEND. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE."
Freshman,1,I feel like I've been victim of bait and switch. I don't feel supported at all. Now they want to spend $330 million to get our athletics facilities all sparkly. Two of my classes have no ventilation and ancient relic furniture!
Sophomore,1,"This is NOT the college for me! As a Veteran of the Armed Forces & 100% education benefits GI Bill recipient. I applied as a Horticulture major. I was proactive in meeting all the requirements. My complaint is with the incompetence of the academic advisor. For weeks I had unanswered questions, repeated canx. appointments, & no return calls. I could not register for classes, as she also has your PIN. She has zero regards in the success of your future & commits little advisor-student interaction. I'm dissatisfied with her being the ONLY advisor for the on-line students. She has failed professionally in advising me with my education aspirations, abilities, pursuits, & degree plan. I elevated my complaint to the Dean of Agriculture, only to have my email returned to the advisor. I received NO response from the school to rectify the situation. I do not recommend this institution to others. I deployed 3 tours & served my country honorably-this school is not worthy of my hard-earned money."
College Junior,1,The hazing needs to stop.
College Sophomore,1,"It is not hard to tell who has the drugs/alcohol.  And most are willing to share and/or sell.  I am not part of greek life, but I am always welcome to drink as much and as often as I like at greek parties.  The dorms always have alcohol and the RA's don't care one way or the other."
College Freshman,1,The off campus housing is way too expensive. We are students that pay so much money to attend school and we're forced to pay a ridiculous amount for rent. It is very disappointing that they try and rip off college students so much.
College Freshman,1,"I had heard that Poling was the party dorm and that it was a lot of fun to live there. Unfortunately, I quickly found out that living in Poling is exactly like high school. It is extremely cliquey, and I found that it is an odd scenario in which the ""weird"" kids are the ones who dominate the hall. Aside from that, it always smells gross, the rooms are tiny (I was in an economy triple, BIG mistake), and it is overwhelmingly full of idle behavior. If you want to study, the study lounge is not the place, and the halls are ALWAYS flooded with people just hanging out. Lots of gossiping about one another, lots of drinking in the hall. Quiet hours are NOT enforced what so ever, so don't expect to get any sleep. I can't speak for the other RAs, but mine was very creepy and took advantage of myself and other girls in the hall when they were drinking. The showers are gross, and you have to walk down the hall, where everyone is constantly ""hanging out"", either in a robe or clothes that you have to awkwardly change out of once you reach the showers. If you divide the cost to live there, it comes to about 560 a month, before adding the meal plan. 560 to share a tiny room with two other people, and that's virtually all that you get. Don't live in Poling, I would recommend living in a dorm with a bathroom (generally shared with at least one other room). Teabou and Bloss would be the best dorms to live in by far. Hope posting this saves someone from making the same mistake I did!!"
College Sophomore,1,Parking is impossible and now they're trying to charge us even more to park in front of our own dorms.
College Freshman,1,Passes are expensive and even if you have them it can be really difficult to find parking anywhere within a five block radius of campus. There are a lot of people who commute and have cars and not enough spaces. And then even if you have a pass the school kicks you out on game days. It's like how am I supposed to go to class if I can't park?
College Junior,1,frats and sororities are trash.  They should all be eliminated.  Bunch of mofos.
College Freshman,1,rains non stop very cold in winter and muddy.
College Junior,1,I don't know how I am going to use my degree in English without going to graduate school.
College Junior,1,Campus housing is really expensive and you don't get what you pay for. Things are really small and old.  A lot of places have mold. 
College Junior,1,The campus is not car friendly.  It's nearly impossible to find a spot remotely close to campus and they are constantly giving people parking tickets.
College Junior,1,"There is a beautiful fall and spring, but way too much rain for long periods of time."
College Senior,1,There is almost no parking compared to the number of permits they sell. I have been late to class because  of it several times. Most days I have to get there an hour early to get a spot.
College Freshman,1,There isn't much around here. At least not close enough to walk. Most the places off campus are fast food or bars.
College Freshman,1,"There isn't much parking. And if there is spots, they are always taken. Also, you can't park in certain spots without getting towed or a ticket. They should warn freshman about that. When it comes game day, parking is a nightmare. You aren't allowed to park anywhere. I wish I didn't bring my car."
College Sophomore,1,"It is very difficult and expensive to find off campus housing in corvallis oregon. Many are taken within the first couple months before school, and anything close to campus is ridiculously expensive."
College Sophomore,1,"Underage drinking is not excepted on campus, if caught you receive an MIP charge and get a fine."
College Sophomore,1,I'm miserable when I go for months without seeing the sun. I sometimes really hate the weather.
College Sophomore,1,"It is very difficult to obtain a scholarship if you are an underclass man who is white. Once you get older and know which major you'd like to pursue, a variety of scholarships come available."
College Sophomore,1,"Spots fill up really really fast, so make sure you get there at least 30 mins early, sometimes even earlier during finals week and the first week of the term."
College Freshman,1,"Although there are many options for types of food, the quality is unacceptable and disgusting to look at. In the Arnold dining center the other day there were moldy green tangerines for sale."
College Freshman,1,The police force is pretty strict on underage drinking and drug use.
College Student,1,Parking on campus can be quite difficult as it heavily populated and utilized. I recommend arriving in plenty of time before classes to ensure that you can have a parking spot.
College Sophomore,1,Extremely hard to find parking. I would highly recommend investing in a bike.
College Sophomore,1,Oregon State does not give very many scholarships.
College Junior,1,"When you live off-campus and it's raining nearly every day in winter, you have to walk in pouring rain, gusty winds, and the biting cold. You have to take extra precautions in order to keep projects that you're bringing to class safe from the rain, and your shoes will be soaked through if you don't have rainboots. The rain will soak through your backpack, getting your stuff all wet, even if you have an umbrella. It's really inconvenient to have to hold an umbrella that threatens to snap in half or blow away in the wind, especially when you're busy carrying other things for class."
College Senior,1,"Although I do not park around OSU I have many friends that do and they complain a lot about it. As OSU is working to increase enrollment, they are giving little attention to the college infrastructure. Not only is there not enough parking for students, but they are removing some lots."
Recent Alumnus,1,Not Too Many Options â€“ I fee like I only have 4 places to go for lunch. It forced me to cook my own meal.
College Sophomore,1,It rains alot and coming from Southern California that sucks.
College Junior,1,"Wear Appropriate Foot Gear â€“ Parking at Oregon State is more than frustrating. Firstly, it's about $200 for a parking pass. Not many college students have that much money to blow on parking. For those who don't there does happen to be some off campus parking available, but you have to be prepared to walk a decent amount of time to get to your classes, in addition to moving your car every 2 hours to avoid ticketing. The main parking on campus is on the opposite side of campus to where majority of classes are. The parking is very disappointing, but does provide great exercise to the students as they have to travel 15 or more minutes to their destinations."
College Senior,1,"If You Have to Deal With Real People, It Sucks. Once you have filled out the FAFSA, the grant money comes in smoothly to your account, and the same is generally true of scholarships. However, I have had a very difficult time dealing with some of the folks in the financial aid department, being re-directed to different people, not receiving responses for several weeks, and general miscommunication between the FA office and my doctor, which eventually resulted in my losing a scholarship! When trying to get through paperwork, if they did not receive something, they did not send out any notices saying that they were missing part of the paperwork, I just had to call in every week to see if something was happening or not."
Recent Alumnus,1,hardly any parking even with the new parking structure! we need more parking!!!
College Freshman,1,"Brown Broccoli â€“ I attempted to eat healthy one day by getting some broccoli with my pasta and it was brown, soft, and gross!"
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is terrible, it can be really hard to find a spot depending on the time of day, and  you have to get to campus sometimes 30 minutes early in order to barely make it to class on time"
College Junior,1,"I wish we were better!!!!!!! Everyone loves going to the game, rain or shine. We will even camp all night for tickets and considering we have a pretty awesome fan base why does our football team still suck!"
College Junior,1,"College of Psychology. For the psychology department there is no application for the college. A lot of other majors overlap with upper division psychology classes, that are taken by Psychology majors. Student teacher ratio is 1:40, more students need the classes than there are teachers. The classes must be taken in order, so some psychology majors can't take the upper division because they haven't taken the lower classes, because their spots are taken by other students in different majors."
College Junior,1,"All colleges are different. For most you must have a C or higher to pass a class. The university rules are a D. A lot of the advisors suck. Go to the professors.

Other than that, the school is pretty laid back."
College Freshman,1,"parking is terrible. They put up meters where I usually park without warning me first, and I got two tickets. Also parking on game days (Saturdays) is seriously the worst thing ever. My car got towed, so every game day you have to move your car even though you paid for the permit. pretty unfair."
College Senior,1,"Good Teachers, but Not Safe. Student conduct does not take sexual assault,  stalking or kidnapping seriously. They would rather insult you than have you file a report. They do not enforce no contact orders. It doesn't matter if it happens on campus, or if the person doesnt deny commiting sexual assault -they don't care and will try to brush it under the rug. Staying here was a mistake. 

The good things - most of the professors really care about their subjects. It makes learning fun. The cafeteria  food is pretty good."
College Senior,1,"Rates High on Paper â€“ Many people have a hard time getting past stereotypes. I have had a few gay friends or friends who were percieved as gay, put in dangerous situations. One friend was followed home for blocks while people threatened to kill him. The university did not take this event seriously and blamed him for it. I also had a friend who was jumped walking home, because he was wearing a pink bandana. 
There are no prayer rooms students. My Muslim friends have a hard time fitting in their prayer schedule without being gawked at. 
It is really difficult being a woman here. Student conduct does NOT take sexual assault or stalking seriously. they are not respectful to victims of sexual assault  and do not help keep these students safe. I have had multiple male students tell me that rape is justifiable (girl is drunk, girl is wearing ""slutty"" clothing.)"
College Junior,1,"DON't GET ME STARTED â€“ First, parking permits cost an arm and a leg. Second, there is nowhere to park. Third, when you try to leave, everyone is in the way. Fourth, STUDENTS WALKING AND BIKING EVERYWHERE. I really...just don't parking on campus."
College Junior,1,Needs Improvement. I found it very difficult to find money through financial aid. It took a while for someone to get back to me about why some of my money was lost even though I had already accepted the money for those loans. It is really hard for me to find any scholarships.
College Sophomore,1,"Cold, Wet, and Miserable â€“ It rains almost every single day (no joke).  It's almost always cold and you're lucky if you see blue skies and the sun out.  A lot of people complain about being depressed here, which is probably because of the weather (seasonal depression)."
College Sophomore,1,"Bad food, bad hours â€“ Ever want to eat and stay up past 11. Sorry, but that's not allowed. Good thing college students aren't known for staying up late or eating a lot. Otherwise I'd accuse OSU of caring much more about profit margin than its students. (Which happens to be a common theme here)"
College Junior,1,"Bars Better Than Clubs â€“ The clubs around OSU are pretty bad.  There is virtually nothing for under-21s and the few places that do exist are lame anyway.  House parties are all over the place on friday and saturday nights, which sort of makes up for it.  There are, however, a few cool bars around for a more relaxed evening."
College Junior,1,"Nice but Lacking Nightlife â€“ Corvallis is pretty small, and at times feels like there is little to do.  The nightlife is pretty weak here, there are a few places to dance but as far as clubs go they rank low on the list.  There are a few fun bars around town.  It is holding up the tradition of great northwest beer with the addition of Block 15 brewing, which makes some of the best beer anywhere."
College Senior,1,"food sux â€“ limited hours, few options, and students make the food.  i've had to learn to cook some meals as a result."
College Sophomore,1,"Late Night Eater? If you are a late night eater, then too bad for you because OSU's dining options close at 7:30pm and the snack bars close at 10. What happened to studying while eating something at midnight? Well that isn't even an option anymore."

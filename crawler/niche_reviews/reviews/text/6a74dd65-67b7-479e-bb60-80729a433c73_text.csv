Senior,5,I absolutely love UAMS. I am currently perusing my 2nd degree with them! I have had the best experiences with this University.
Senior,5,"The distant learning program is easy, manageable and well put together. The courses are easy to follow and hte instructors are great. The IT department is always just one call or email away to help with any technical issues."
Sophomore,5,The staff is so friendly! They care about you and your future and go out of their way  to make sure you have all the resources you need to succeed
Senior,5,I love this school and my program! One of the best parts of being a student at this school is access to the simulation center and the IPC on the fifth floor. This school provides so many opportunities for the students to exercise the skills they’ve acquired so they’re comfortable and prepared for the real deal after graduation and entering their practice.
Freshman,5,"The school is very nice and neat, they allow you to be yourself without anyone telling you what to do. You feel your most comfortable while you're here and you wont be judged at all because everyone accepts everyone there."
Junior,5,Going to UAMS is awesome. Everyone there is helpful. The campus is a little like a maze but otherwise I enjoy the life there. The classes are fast paced because the program isn't long at all but it is worth it. We moved into a new building that has been a blessing. The only thing I would change about the campus is that it is easy to get lost and the parking is not very good since we are connected to a hospital. There is a shuttle that will take you places though and the security to escort you whenever you need it.
Senior,5,"I have received one degree from UAMS in Radiography, and am working on my BSN. The teachers, staff, and resources available here are amazing. There can, sometimes, be an over-emphasis on online-learning (which can require extra input on your part) but there is always someone to help. As with any school, if you show the commitment to learn/succeed, you will. And the staff will make sure of that!"
Junior,5,I really love this school. It is well organized and has a great faculty and staff. The courses are relevant to my profession and the school has a program that teaches how to interact with other medical professions.
Graduate Student,5,Professionalism is number one quality. Professors are willing to help with any assistance. The College of Nursing has many tools that can be used I order to succeed. The library has excellent resources and people available if needed.
Graduate Student,5,I am a new graduate student at the Clinton School which is associated with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.  This is a new totally online degree for a Masters of Public Service.  How cool is that?
Junior,5,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences has expanded my education and views on life. Every professor will do anything and everything to help you succeed. Everyone on campus is very helpful and they even provide transportation!
College Junior,5,"I am in a program with a set curriculum, so I do not choose my courses, but all my professors are wonderful.  We all have an advisor that we are required to meet with 2-3 times per semester, which really strengthens the bond between students and faculty.  We have pot-lucks with the faculty often and feel close as a community."
College Junior,5,"Our program is relatively new (Physician Assistant), but everyone in the most recent graduating class had a job within 6 months of graduation.  I am not worried at all about being prepared for my career when I graduate."
College Junior,5,"I love being a student at UAMS.  Our school has many programs to help those less fortunate, which is a huge part of why I applied here.  Our faculty are motivated, engaged, and extremely dedicated to their students."
College Senior,5,They have to be strict.  We're gonna be medical professionals.
College Senior,5,"We are pretty busy, but I will definitely be prepared for my line of work."
College Senior,5,We are being prepared for our accredidation exams and getting work experience in functioning labs. There is also a distance program.
College Sophomore,5,Tons of variety from cheep late night to expensive
College Junior,5,"Lots of variety! If you can think it up, there's a place to cater to your desires!"
College Junior,5,"Drugs and Alcohol Have Not Been an Issue – I have never seen this kind of behavior at UAMS. No one has time to act on this kind of behavior, or at least I don't anyways and my fellow classmates have never spoke of this. UAMS would not tolerate this."
Graduate Student,4,I wanted to be a sonographer ever since I was little and I was debating from different colleges but I ended up at UAMS. It has taught me so many great things and the professors are amazing.
Alum,4,"UAMS is a wonderful place with a wide variety of medical professional careers.  Professors, staff, facility and environment are great for individuals to thrive in the medical career."
Junior,4,I Love the fact that this school has so many avenues put in place to help us succeed no matter what. there are always teachers who go the extra mile to make sure we know the information we need to know. they make every effort to make sure everyone pass.
College Senior,4,"I don't live there, but they aren't too expensive."
College Senior,4,YOu can find a reasonable place if you keep up on zillow.
College Senior,4,"Little Rock has a high crime rate, but the school and hospital have proper security measures in place."
College Senior,4,"The pre-requisites are tough for people coming from private colleges, but the academic environment is very challenging and supportive at the same time."
College Sophomore,4,They have a teaching hospital and lots of options for a diverse study
College Sophomore,4,Since its a college that is towards a specific degree there is not much emphasis in sports
College Sophomore,4,It seems average compared to my previous college I have attended
College Sophomore,4,You notice them around and feel safe
College Sophomore,4,It it nice close to the river where parks are located
College Sophomore,4,Bumpers College staff and professors are great
College Junior,4,Financial Aid staff on campus helpful and good to answer any questions you may have. The process is quick and they keep things up to date.
College Freshman,4,We have 3 fraternities just within the College of Pharmacy!
College Freshman,4,The curriculum is challenging without being difficult just for difficulty's sake. All my professors so far have been very open-door.
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of emergency phones located around campus.  There are also several security officers roaming the area at all times.
College Senior,4,"Generally I feel safe on campus, we do have security and police that patrol the area 24/7"
College Junior,4,"Our weather here isn't very hazardous. However, if it does ""snow"" or 
""ice"" we normally have to take a different approach, such as not attending class that day. This isn't a big issue. Tornadoes and such are more of a threat to us than snow or ice."
College Junior,4,"The shuttle Bus at UAMS is the best option for campus transportation. The bus runs every 15 minutes, so the only thing one may be responsible for is being there on time. However, the police are also on campus and any time you may need them, such as aster dark, they are willing to do anything. UAMS may be strict but they worry about their students and clients and provide whatever they possibly can."
College Senior,2,We're too busy to hang out.
College Senior,2,It's a medical school.  Who has time for athletics?
College Junior,2,Little Rock is not a good place to be at night. Not much to do for underage nightlife. Transportation is below average.
College Freshman,2,"We have a various range of political views, especially when dealing with the economics of the government.  I would say socially we are moderately diverse.  Racially, we have some room to grow, but I do not feel that is due to any kind of prejudice."
College Sophomore,2,Not Many – There are not many avaliable. Which I find surprising being they only except 17 students a year.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The transportation is great but, it depends on which shuttle you catch which determines the route to the campus. The shuttle only has particular stops and will not stop anywhere else along the route."
College Senior,1,There is no Greek Life.
College Junior,1,Bad weather makes for a difficult time getting to class on time due to the distant from parking to classrooms.
College Junior,1,Most students and faculty have a 10 minute walk to campus unless an expensive permit is purchased yearly. UAMS does offer a shuttle bus that runs constantly all day.

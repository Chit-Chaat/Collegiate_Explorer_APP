Freshman,5,"I love it here. The academics are great, the people are great and I don't regret coming here. Its pretty awesome."
Junior,5,"First of all, the Georgia Institute of Technology have a great workload. They make the student understand the material. If you finish your homework, it is likely that you will graduate. The campus is great. As the best engineering school in Georgia, it has great things inside the school with a long history with it. I was amazed that all the companies are inside the Georgia Institute of technology to hire student and do a project with them. Statistic says that 80 percent of Georgia undergraduate gets there job even before graduating. I did not believe that at the beginning but after I saw all the companies on campus, I had to believe it. The school also provides a great new student program called FASET. The leaders at FASET is very welcoming and warm. We get a small group meeting where we can make friends and open up with each other, and it is just a great experience. Also, the experience they share gives amazing insights too. Overall, tech is a great place to study and have fun"
Junior,5,"The professors were great and involved in the class. They care the class and try to teach student the best way they can. Some teachers do synchronous type of class and some of teachers do asynchronous type of class. Student can choose what type of class fits for them and build their own schedule. For me, I liked a synchronous class where I have be online meeting at the time assigned. It was helpful to motivate me and keep me in the class so that I can focus and manage my time well. 
We all know that studying at tech is not an easy thing to do. However, there is multiple TAs will try to help us and explain the material very kindly. Almost any time of the week, students can get help and learn from TAs and professors. If that does not workout, there is 1 on 1 tutoring options too. I found TAs very helpful when I study, because they were student not too long ago, and they know how to explain
If you know how to study and how to use the resource you have. you will be amazing student at tech"
Sophomore,5,I feel like tech did a pretty good job with their online platform as it was very similar to in person teaching in that teachers still had regular classes and all the material and pacing was the same throughout. I was concerned about cheating and how the curves were going to be affected but it turn S out that teachers just made their tests open note instead and made it really hard to actually use your notes which helped with that concern of mine.
Sophomore,5,This is school is the best. They show that they care about you and really push for you to be the best. Everyone is very kind and approachable!!
Junior,5,"As a smaller major, my experience has been very personalized and helpful, and I have found utilized a good majority of the plethora of resources offered to us as students. Georgia Tech is a school where students are pushed into new ways of thinking and challenged to continually improve. Situated in Midtown Atlanta, the opportunities are everywhere."
Junior,5,It’s a wonderful college! I met a lot of new friends and got involved in different clubs. You can find a Lot of opportunities via Tech!
Graduate Student,5,"The online experience was amazing i was able to communicate with my peers and professors with no problem at any time i  needed help. The professors always shoot you emails to keep you updated of any changes in the curriculum, and that come sin very handy for later on in the semester."
Graduate Student,5,"Well I am looking to go to this school for my masters in Architecture and it seems to have an amazing program. The school it self has so many useful resources that one can use through out their career. When I visited the environment of all the college kids around was positive and made me want to come here. Their sports programs are among the best in the country and their football stadium looks amazing, I cannot wait until i can attend a football game. As to my career the architecture program has a beautiful facility and the professors are always willing to help on everything they can. The learning environment went beyond my expectations and that is one of the reasons why i would love to attend this university as my last path to the end of my study years. I really recommend students like me to reach and visit this school because they are not going to be disappointed. Lastly i will like to thank the faculty that helped me when i went to visit the school and the architecture program."
Junior,5,"The online learning experience has been very effective. The coursework is spread out evenly and the professors are very willing to help you one on one. Additionally, there is more leniency with grading which creates less stress for students and allows them to grow more."
Junior,5,I've taken mostly computer science classes online. The CS program here is excellent and I feel like I learn more online than I would in person. Other online classes have been so-so.
Junior,5,"Great school. The professors are great and the research is amazing. However, the housing and dining options are pretty mediocre."
Alum,5,"While the focus on STEM is concentrated and not for everyone, Georgia Tech prepares you to be a better thinker, problem solver, and person. I balanced my engineering curriculum with extra classes in liberal arts to provide me a little more balance. As someone who has now been out in industry for the past 15 years, GT has even a better reputation in the corporate world than its academic one (which is already strong)."
Alum,5,I did not take an online course but practically every classroom lecture is 100% available online for viewing multiple times at your own pace.
Senior,5,"Georgia Tech has been a life-changing experience. It was my dream from the very beginning to attend Georgia Tech and I do not regret it one bit. The level of education is unmatched as well as your return of investment. I do not see myself anywhere else, regardless of how rigorous the school can be."
Sophomore,5,"The internet is full of crap about this school: too stressful, no help from admin, etc... Don't believe a word. GT is an engineering school; people come here to be engineers, that's not easy, the complainers enrolled thinking it'd be a cake walk. There are parties and alcohol and friends and crazy college nights. The classes are not bad, not easy, but not bad, and the students all around you will help you study and survive. The student climate here is amazing: the kids are focused and mature but also funny and relaxed. There are no idiots here. I came in incredibly skeptical, but two weeks in, I had a group of friends and several clubs already. Put in the effort, and you will be rewarded. This school knows it's good, the students do too; when you are here, you will feel on top of the world, and you are."
Sophomore,5,"Good! The professors are used to teaching online through various other expereinces and have some material prepared, they went out of their ways to extend assignemnts and exams and even changed final exemption policies to help students out."
Junior,5,I really enjoy the school. The one thing that I wish I could change would be the culture of the university.
Freshman,5,"Georgia tech is an outstanding school, with incredible academics and an amazing community of students an faculty to support you during your journey."
Freshman,5,"Pretty greaet school, I was amzed when I first set foot inside campus, it felt as if I was no longer in Atlanta and I had entered an entirely different town"
Sophomore,5,"Very welcoming community, extremely intelligent faculty and students, leaders in innovation and technology."
Niche User,5,"Georgia Tech is a great school filled with great people. The academics are top 3 in the nation for public universities, with similar rankings among all universities in the fields of computer science and engineering. With the cost of attendance as low as it is, there’s no reason not to go to Tech."
Niche User,5,"My daughter graduated from GT and had a fabulous experience. She was in a sorority and that has proven to be very helpful in the business world. However, it was expensive.

She graduated with high honors, Had a great social life, and has been employed since graduation. Cannot say enough good things about Georgia Tech."
Junior,5,Great school. Awesome Nuclear Engineering Program. Plenty of diversity and friendly student body. Campus is always under construction but I am excited to see final project. Most professors are very great and accommodating. Many school activities available and  events.
Niche User,5,"I did I am I freshman In high school and quite enjoyed my field trips there. Even though I am not in the college, visit there on field trips related to my school. Georgia Tech has really made me enjoy my experience there. Georgia Tech also being quite expensive, It would be nice if I were to win it and be able to spend on college."
Freshman,5,"Georgia Tech will be what you expect for academic and professional goals, with challenging classes and structured preparation. Moreover we should improve food service and the dorms."
Niche User,5,"The students at Georgia Tech are ambitious individuals who all share the same goal of striving to succeed. Here, I feel like I belong with this group and that it is a place I can call home, being with people who are dedicated like me."
Niche User,5,"I had the opportunity to attend the Atlanta STEM College and Career Fair hosted by GA Tech on Sept 29, 2019. I enjoyed the presentations and Q& A by staff and students which provided additional information on a career path I found very interesting which could possibly enhance and/or compliment my primary major of mechanical engineering."
Freshman,5,"Tech is awesome! I'm a current freshman, and so far, it's been such an awesome and eye-opening experience!"
Freshman,5,"All of my professors cared about their classes and were easy to learn from.  It was difficult to manage the workload at times, but I've heard that it gets to be easier over time.  I got involved with the Marching Band and had an amazing experience every game day.  The campus is beautiful, especially the Campanille fountain.  My one regret was taking the GT 1000 freshman orientation class.  I found that is was time consuming without being exceptionally informative."
Niche User,5,Beautiful Campus. Walking past the red brick buildings towering over your very being is a very humbling experience. Such structures only fuel your curiosity as to whats inside for you to explore.
Freshman,5,lots of academic opportunities are given to students especially engineering majors. Has great connections with both other academic establishments and industry
Freshman,5,"Great Return of Investment, wonderful Dance Clubs and other extra curricular activities, nice Campus, nice housing, great food and great labs and opportunities which keeps you busy in college!"
Freshman,5,Applied Education is the best at this college. Great extracurricular activities and return on investment....................................................
Senior,5,"The academics of Georgia Tech really do offer you a top-class education and links you with the most amazing resources. You have access to the best facilities and instructors in the whole world who can connect you to an even broader area in the real world. However, I wish the workload and the difficulty of the classes could be a bit easier. Many students struggle and find themselves switching into a major that's easier, but not as rewarding. The campus food could also stand to improve a lot because of the lackluster quality and diversity in types of food."
Freshman,5,I'm extremely pleased with the amount of resources provided here. Both academics and non-academics. There are so many options for one to receive academic help. The campus is beautiful and there are always events happening that give you good welfare.
Freshman,5,"Georgia tech is an immersive experience. A lot of people think that it's tough but it isn't. There is just so much to do that most people end up taking more things than they can handle. 
Since I came over to Georgia Tech I've been involved in research and robotics. I also joined the rugby team, a sport I have never played in my life. GT allowed me to follow my dreams by enabling me to pursue a neuroscience/ engineering degree. Hopefully, I will be able to do more research in that field to help people less fortunate than I am."
Junior,5,"Excellent school. TONS of resources for difficult classes and students create a very collaborative, non-competitive environment. Many professors are outstanding, but there are a few duds in the mix. Excellent study abroad opportunities for all majors that are often overlooked. Beautiful, modern campus with excellent, updated facilities. Campus food is bad. At Tech, you are surrounded by intelligent people that make going back to the normal world strange."
Freshman,5,I love Georgia tech. The campus is beautiful. The academics are amazing. The faculty are great and there are so many opportunities.
Freshman,5,"This is the best place on earth. The academics are great, the student orgs are fantastic, the social scene is great. Everything about it (except for the food) is more than anyone can ask for. 
Also, the campus is beautiful."
Niche User,5,Georgia Tech is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good college
Niche User,5,"My daughter graduated from Georgia Tech three year ago with full satisfaction and highest honor. She loves challenging academics and friendly people on the campus and is sure to recommend the college to others without second thoughts. As an international student, my daughter landed a job in one top US IT company with very good compensation. She thinks all the Tech students are well prepared for the outside world."
Senior,5,The school is extremely challenging but it is worth 100% of the effort. You put in what you get out and there is frankly no better way to put that. There needs to be restructuring of some classes in terms of the workload but the professors are always there to help and guide you along the way.
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman attending GT. I've visited the campus and went to the orientation, and I really like the whole atmosphere. Everyone seems very unite."
Freshman,5,"As a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I have access to countless opportunities provided by the school. While the housing isn't the best there are many student organizations to take part in, removing from the time you spend in your dorm. Also, the academics of the school are superb, all the professors I have had have cared about the students. Overall the Georgia Institute of Technology is a great school with great return for the payment you make."
Junior,5,"Love it here! Yes, it is as hard as everyone says it is, but if you don't want a school that challenges you, then go to a different school."
Graduate Student,5,"Georgia tech is an amazing place to grow and develop as a student, especially if you are planning to do engineering. There are many resources available to you to develop new technologies and plenty of great mentorship and networking opportunities."
Sophomore,5,"Although challenging, the academics are amazing! The professors are very passionate about what they teach and I personally found them to be very friendly and helpful. I think Tech would go much further if it worked on its dorms and campus food."
Sophomore,5,"The school itself is awesome. The quality of professors improve as you get into your major's classes. I've met tons of talented people with huge drive. The school is what you make out of it though, so make sure to put yourself out there and try different things. The location is also perfect. Atlanta is a great city with tons of activities to do on the weekends. All around great experience with awesome people."
Sophomore,5,Being here is an exciting and fresh experience of college life. The professors here give strong lectures and help the students with many of their needs. The university also provides many connections to businesses for future stable jobs.
Freshman,5,"A great institution, especially for STEM majors! Georgia Tech provides a rich learning experience, vast research and plentiful of co-op opportunities, and a multi-cultural campus. It is ranked in the top 10 schools for many STEM majors in the United States due to its strong education system."
Graduate Student,5,It has been an extremely beneficial experience for me. The school is a world renowned school with very high recognition. The legacy of the school speaks for itself. Great school.
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Tech was the perfect mixture of academics and extracurriculars, I really loved being truly challenged in all my courses while also having endless resources on how to get help. There were always free school-wide events which were very fun to attend, and never boring or irrelevant. I mostly loved the school pride we had, and everyone's devotion to representing GT well."
Freshman,5,"Tech's campus has a great amount of greenspace and lots of activities. Everyone on campus is really helpful, and the amenities (gym, food halls, eateries, health center) were nice."
Alum,5,"Incredibly fun, schoolwork is only hard if you can't manage your time. A lot of people take 4.5 to 5 years to complete their degrees, so no pressure on loading a lot of classes."
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Tech is unique because it has the perfect balance between Academic and social life. Everyone there knows how to have fun and live in the city, but everyone also knows how to focus. There are so many people that provide or act as resources on campus to strive for academic success and set everyone up for a bright future while enjoying the time they spend there."
Niche User,5,"I love how nice the staff is, they are always willing to answer all your questions and help you solve your issues. Also, you can tell that the student body is very cooperative between themselves."
Freshman,5,"Georgia Tech is definitely the most challenging experience I've had thus far in life. Not only are classes rigorous, but balancing extracurricular activities and a social life has been a slight challenge. Overall though, I love the vibrant student life and campus culture at Tech."
Niche User,5,Georgia Insitute of technology is simply the best university for any student wishing to study engineering especially. Student life there is incredible and you should really take this university  into consideration in your future college list
Graduate Student,5,"I have not started attending GA Tech yet (I will this fall) but I have visited the campus several times and I have met with faculty and staff.  The campus is lovely, the faculty and staff are friendly and helpful, and it was easy for me to get around with their reliable trolley system."
Alum,4,"Generally a pretty good experience. Undergraduate is easy enough if you're able to schedule your time an stay responsible for your own workload. Easy to learn a lot if you want to, lots of professors are willing to provide help and the campus provides lots of resources."
Alum,4,"Don't have a lot of experience with online learning. Graduated Spring 2019, returning Spring 2021 to move towards a graduate degree."
Freshman,4,Its been tough but that's the case with online learning anywhere. I think everyone is trying their best to make it as comfortable as possible.
Sophomore,4,I would say that tech definitely has its reputation for being a pretty good college and if you are planning on majoring in any of the majors that Georgia tech has a high rank in such as computer science or engineering definitely plan to apply as the college could have a significant impact on your future career. That being said there are some other elements besides the prestige that you should be aware of. Food is not great and if you buy a meal plan you are really only limited to a few places around campus that serve mediocre food with really bad staff. I am quite picky about food though so that may affect my decision as most of the food they serve for a meal plan is classic American food that I don't really enjoy. The lines for food are so long that it can be really annoying especially if you only have 30 minutes to eat before your next class. The other aspects of the college is pretty standard I would say and there's nothing else that really stands out to me.
Niche User,4,Great campus but you may still have a sense of unease in the big city. You'll also be able to find things to do on campus  or at the very least nearby.
Niche User,4,Professors are can be tough but are willing to work with you. The campus also promotes a learning environment which is wonderful.
Junior,4,The online courses for the most part were formatted well. There were occasional technological issues but overall not bad. Taking online courses-especially because more courses were offered- was a good way to make quarantine useful.
Junior,4,"I've had a pretty good experience at GT. I've joined a lot of extracurriculars, like Greek Life and sustainability orgs. The football isn't good but the school spirit is excellent. I'm in one of the easier majors so my experience has been a little better than others I know. Highly recommend Liberal Arts @ GT."
Junior,4,"I didn't take any classes online. However, I have heard mostly good things about the online learning experience."
Senior,4,I took some distance learning classes due to the pandemic and they were overall great. There were a few kinks due to the suddenness of it all but overall great!
Junior,4,I took my classes online after the virus and Georgia tech handled it very well. It was an easy transition.
Sophomore,4,"I love Tech. It was my dream school and always will be. Of course it's not perfect. Tenured professors can be lazy and there isnt a lot of fostering of student relationships outside of the classroom, but overall it's a gorgeous campus with a lot of amazing opportunities. I'm so glad I went here."
Sophomore,4,"Personally, while the online classes are actually quite well set up and geared specifically toward online learning, as someone with slow internet that doesn't work well for me. But if you have good connection it's a great program."
Graduate Student,4,"I would like to recommend Georgia Tech(GT) to prospective student due to several attractive experiences. As its name showed, the school is to focused on enhancing disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics so that many students can have numerous chances to be involved in intensive education and professional researches. In addition, the GT has offered one of the largest career fair which bridges between academia and industry. Thus, GT students easily experience to apply for co-op, internship and full-time positions every semester from hundreds of companies. In fact, most of GT alumni have been offered by employer before they graduate. Lastly, GT students can experience many club activities in terms of cultural diversity, athletics, and professional leadership.  On campus, I have been involved in diverse student organizations such as Student Government Association (SGA), Korean American Scientists and Engineers Association (KSEA) and Archery club."
Graduate Student,4,"Even in harsh condition due to COVID-19, most of faculty in Georgia Tech, they made significant efforts to design online courses and successfully switched courses from offline to online. At first, some of student concerned about quality of teaching due to changes. However, our faculty already prepared themselves for online classes in advance before spread of COVID-19 so that they have improved and developed online distant learning system for last 10 years. Their efforts finally paid off and many GT students including undergraduate and graduate were able to continue their academic plans without a hitch. In the future, our smart faculty and students will collaborate to advance online learning systems based on lessons we learned in these days."
Junior,4,It is a very tough school but will be worth it when you come out the other side with a degree from one of the top public schools in the country.
Niche User,4,"As someone who has many friends who attend GaTech for both undergraduate and graduate studies, I highly recommend this school for its return on investment and camaraderie."
Niche User,4,Georgia Tech is a very welcoming and well rounded school that is very student oriented . The students and professors are very friendly and welcoming and always have answers to any question i have. The food is great and the campus is beautiful and has many accommodations for its students. This school is labeled one of the best in American and for good reason. It really is and it's evident why so many want to attend here. The programs they offer are very nurturing and give you exactly what you pay for.
Junior,4,Really great school with incredible opportunities and resources. There is a problem with mental health that is relatively prevalent. Athletics are exciting and the classes are very interesting. Come here for a rigorous academic career and fruitful future. Be careful with mental health though.
Niche User,4,I went on a tour.  It was super impressive seeing what they had there and how the program worked.  It helped me decide that their engineering program was not for me because it was too industry centered.  That is fantastic for kids who want that experience though.
Niche User,4,Very good program. Computer Science and many other programs are top notch. Anyone who has the opportunity to go here should.
Freshman,4,"Tech is an excellent institution. Classes are intimidating, don't let that scare you into choosing to go somewhere else. We all have to fail sometimes, and jobs take into consideration the difficulty and reputation of the school. Be aware that you may be top of your high school class, but you are average here. Live your life. Make friends through the million clubs they offer. You won't find the typical greek life that the south is so known for here. People at Tech want you to succeed and, if you can't find resources to help you, you simply aren't looking. You don't feel as if you are in a city, unless you are studying in the library, facing the beautiful skyline. Truly mesmerizing. Tech has so much to offer. Leave with this, there is a HUGE return on investment when you come here. The name Georgia Institute of Technology carries a lot of weight, and the real world knows that."
Senior,4,"Incredible research institute. I have been pushed beyond what I have thought possible and I have grown in many ways. This institute cares about students, and strives towards excellence as one of the top public schools in the nation."
Freshman,4,"Georgia Institute of Technology fosters a great environment for learning. They offer many free resources for students to learn in different ways such as, 1-to-1 tutoring, Interactive Plus Sessions, Help Desks, Academic Coaching and even more.  They also offer resources for mental health if you are feeling overwhelmed or stressed by your academics, or life in general. They host many events during finals season (and throughout the semester) to help relieve stress and make sure you are eating well. These events include, but are not limited to, free food, pet therapy, coloring, tv-watching, meditations, etc."
Niche User,4,"When I visited Georgia Tech, I knew it was the place for me because there whole school was based solely on the needs of the students. It is also a safe place for individuals to learn."
Junior,4,"The academic side of my university is excellent, but we need more resources for mental health on campus."
Freshman,4,"Tech is an experience unlike any other. I have absolutely no free time, am stressed out constantly, and yet I am happier than ever. The people here are genuinely the best people in the world and the sense of camaraderie is unparalleled. Everyone here is just trying their best and all have such genuinely good souls. The academics are so incredibly rigorous apart from a couple majors. If you can survive this place, it will so be worth it."
Senior,4,Georgia Tech is a very challenging academic school with a high return on investment. Its hard but its worth it. You walk away better than you did when you started.
Niche User,4,Georgia Tech has been pretty great! My best friend is a current attendee and she feels right at home on campus. The Greek community is wonderful and supportive and there haven't been any issues with sectionalism or discrimination.
Sophomore,4,"Georgia Tech is great, it has always been my dream school. However, the academic load is very difficult to handle. Our school almost requires and pressures students to apply for internships and co-ops, so it is very difficult to balance trying to find a job, academics, and social events. However, overall the school is great and filled with great professors and people."
Senior,4,Georgia Tech is definitely rigorous but provides many useful career and academic resources and opportunities for students. I do wish that there would be more study spaces because it is always really difficult to find a table to study at on campus.
Freshman,4,"I started at Tech in the fall of 2019, so I'm still pretty new, but so far my experiences have been great. The coursework is hard and the standards are high, but that's what I expected from an institution with Tech's reputation. The student body is extremely active and holds tons of public events on campus."
Niche User,4,Its a very competitive university but its have been to difficult to get in even though with an excellent GPA and SAT and TOEFL scores
Junior,4,"Georgia Tech is really academically challenging (can take a toll on your mental health if you're not careful) and really expensive (living-wise). The campus is pretty with modern design. While there are good and bad teachers like any school, the academics are top-notch. It is much more happening if you have a car or take MARTA, as it's near midtown and downtown Atlanta; not just a college town."
Senior,4,"The day to day organization of classes and programs can seem a little hectic at first. However, the faculty and students in charge take great care of new students"
Sophomore,4,"Georgia Tech teaches every student the value of hard work. Students who are accepted are used to being the smartest person in the room, but they are in for a surprise when they come to this school. Just being smart doesn't cut it here- you have to be willing to work for what you want. This life lesson carries Tech's students to amazing places the rest of their lives. No matter what you major in, Tech's name is recognizable all over the world. It's an investment in a student's future. In terms of party scenes, Tech is very much a 'work hard party hard school,' and many students take part in Greek life. Its sports teams could use a little work, but it's students do get in free to football games!!"
Freshman,4,"I am really excited to go to Georgia Tech, and based on the courses I have already taken there, I feel that I am going to have a great time there."
Sophomore,4,"I currently attend Georgia Tech and I love it and could not imagine going to another university. Tech is great overall, but it does have some drawbacks. Everyone hates the mandatory freshmen meal plan (understandably so), but you only have to have it the first year that you attend. The dining options at Tech leave much to be desired, but we recently switched food providers so maybe by this Fall semester, food might be much better. The on-campus housing is not good. Rooms are much smaller than those at other state colleges and are quite expensive. Tech is in the middle of Atlanta, right in the city which makes the price kind of understandable, but for about the same price, students can get off-campus housing which is WAY nicer. Also maintenance for housing has a bad reputation because they can be quite slow to respond to requests regarding fixing things in the dorms."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I've found the campus to be quite exquisite. Over the past semester, I've been able to manage my classwork, social life, and extracurricular activities quite well, and the campus has been entirely wonderful. My one recommendation, however, is that the institution improve upon its food options for first-year students."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy going to school at Georgia Tech. The environment is very student friendly, and there are a lot of resources in place to help students succeed. Professors have office hours and are generally approachable. The food and housing, while not amazing, are acceptable and make for decent living conditions, and there are many student organizations, clubs, and other activities to get involved in."
Freshman,4,"Georgia Tech is a great school. At the same time though, it is very challenging. It is in a great area (Midtown Atlanta) and also has a great return as the average salary out of Tech is around 70k. There are many opportunities on campus for students to get experience and help with getting internships, co-ops, and jobs. The only thing I wish Tech would improve on is its food as it is very average and could be way better, considering how high tuition is. Also, I think that more attention to mental and student health should be emphasized as well. Overall, I do enjoy Georgia Tech. Know what you are getting yourself into though!"
Junior,4,Improved bus system; its not bad but the app they use is trash. They close a lot of dining options on weekends
Freshman,4,"I'm just a freshman right now, but it's going pretty good. Academics are challenging but not impossible. Unfortunately, GT has a reputation for having unnecessarily difficult classes. Many professors here are more about research than teaching. The food is pretty bad, but Sodexo is being replaced this year I believe."
Freshman,4,"Challenging but rewarding school with many opportunities, although there are things to work on regarding mental health and food services, as well as administration."
Freshman,4,Great student body. Classes are very difficult and individual experience can be heavily influenced by the professors. If you like engineering and STEM you will be a great fit. Otherwise it'll just be a torture.
Niche User,4,"Based off of what my family has told me about Georgia Tech, it is a fantastic university with advanced facilities open to all the college students for free. Personally, the best part about the university is its environment as it contains some of the most magnificent sights. With that being said, a great university must contain more than just a nice environment and this is where Georgia Tech truly shines as it provides some of the best professors that are willing and able to andswer the m"
Niche User,4,"I am currently dual enrolling at Georgia Tech, and after my experience in the class and after seeing the campus in person, I have no doubt I will be enrolling there!"
Freshman,4,"Based on my first semester here, Georgia Tech is a wonderful university that has some of the prettiest sights I've ever seen and has some of the most modern facilities available to college students for free. My main highlight would be the Invention Studio, a huge laboratory filled with all kinds of heavy duty machines: 3D printers of various sizes, lazer cutters, a water jet, and even a plasma cutter! The campus can be a bit overwhelming in terms of size in the beginning, but over time you get used to it."
Junior,4,Georgia Tech is a very academically demanding school but prepares student for the workforce. This ensures that after graduation the hard work that students have put in pays off in the form of full time jobs
Junior,4,"Academically, it seemed difficult for engineers which I was not. Obviously, if you are trying to be an engineer, GT is perfect. If you get in, go. The price, the location, the education. I was not one and transferred to UGA as I was not socially happy. Since, my quality of life has been so much better and I had no trouble finding an internship."
Sophomore,4,I appreciate how most students here are so future driven. They want to challenge themselves and work hard to invest in their future and to succeed. I think that their can be improvements to the life on campus with the food and dorming experience.
Graduate Student,4,Georgia Tech is a highly respected institution with a beautiful campus. My experience has been very positive and all my professors have helped me grow professionally and academically. Academic excellence is the standard at Tech and the rigor in this program exhibits that.
Sophomore,4,"It is amazing school with a lot of resources however it does come with a price of being incredibly difficult. There is a reason the acceptance rate is 20% and decreases every year as new students join. GT is a wonderful school especially if you are interested in a career in STEM. After graduated with a bachelor's of science from GT, you would set for life."
Senior,4,"Georgia Tech is a very rigorous school. It has challenged me and broadened my horizons to learn, understand, and appreciate more about the world around me. It also has plenty of resources for various STEM career paths. However, I notice that many students suffer from mental health or depression from the school and I wish the school was more supportive and professors were more understanding about that."
Sophomore,4,"I love the students, campus and geographical location of Georgia Tech. The academics are incredibly hard and most students spend most of their time on academics. However, that's to be expected from such a prestigious school and well worth the respect that comes with being a Yellow Jacket."
Sophomore,4,"Great college to be a student for. Food sucks ass, teachers are also terrible except for a few very good ones. Dorms are hell, Social life is decent, gym is the one of the best things, many students are depressed, failing is not un common even for high achieveing students"
Junior,4,"Georgia Tech is a great school if you're up to the challenge. The academics are amazing, but rigorous. You'll get a lot out of Tech, but it also takes a lot out of you. There is a place for everyone on campus; there are tons of extracurricular clubs and sports, as well as music and arts programs of every level. Most professors are very helpful and want to help you succeed in both your classes and opportunities outside the classroom."
Freshman,4,"Very good school - academics comparable to ivies, however it is a fairly large institution and can weed out people not as prepared"
Senior,4,"Great education, but the culture is a bit too self-deprecating. Campus is nice, but they are always building something new, which leaves little time to appreciate it."
Sophomore,4,I have had a rough start with my college career and GA Tech has been willing to work with me so that I can continue my studies.
College Senior,2,"This is probably because I'm Computational Media and the school just doesn't know what to do with the major, but I've had some fairly bad experiences with career prospects. Most of the internships and job offerings are unrelated to computers, and the ones that do involve computers are in website building and graphic design. I chose this major because I want to make video games. The path of required courses the school makes CM students take is geared towards video game development, but the school turns around and pretends it's a glorified art major. I think there's some miscommunication going on between some higher-ups, and maybe they'll fix that for future generations. All I know is that I'm getting little to no support in finding jobs/internships in my field."
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of people that make it onto campus that do not belong there and that makes crime worse.  The police are there but at night I don't feel comfortable walking alone on campus it just doesn't feel safe
College Freshman,2,There  is much I still need to experience plus I did have some bad experiences so I am hoping it gets better.
College Freshman,2,I am at one of the smallest residence halls. There is no sunlight and no social activities in my residence hall. Bathroom is often dirty. But it is quiet.
College Freshman,2,It's not too great at the moment
College Freshman,2,"The academics is extremely challenging, and even though I study for days on end, I never seem to get the results that I want. Work load is light some weeks and sometimes unbearable other days. The professors that I had this year seem to be passionate about their topic, and helped me when needed. The best study area is probably the study lounges with the white boards."
College Student,2,Georgia Tech will NOT give you any scholarships at all unless you are broke-poor.
College Freshman,2,Mostly given to in-state students
College Sophomore,2,"Gender ratio doesn't help, and even if ""the odds are good, the goods are odd."" Regardless of finding a compatible partner, relationships are hard to maintain due to the demands of school."
College Sophomore,2,Cliquy; lame parties with loud music
College Sophomore,2,No one thinks Tech is a party school
College Freshman,2,its easy to get and everyone lives here but small
College Sophomore,2,"I didn't receive any financial aid from the school at all and I feel like they don't handle scholarship money well. I don't know how other schools do it, but instead of putting it in my account to take care of finances I owe to the school, they mail the money to me personally and I have to go back and put the money in again. I think each department needs to work on buffing up the scholarships offered to each individual college. It should be easier to find scholarships for Computer Science majors and mechanical engineering majors without having to sort through an amalgam of useless applications."
College Sophomore,2,Academics at Tech are excruciating. You really have to want to do well in order to succeed here.
College Sophomore,2,The food on east campus is decent. On west campus the dining (Woodruff) is atrocious.
College Senior,2,I was not able to apply for regular financial aid and institutional scholarships becasue I am an international student. It is very hard to find scholarships for international student.
College Junior,2,Finding Institute-sponsored scholarships is virtually impossible.
College Sophomore,2,"Don't know because I've never had a car here, but I hear people complain about it somewhat frequently"
College Freshman,2,"Even though being able to sign up for a meal plan is awesome, on campus dinning sucks. The reason I did not give it the worst rating is because it does have options (vegetarian, sandwiches, meat...) and it has Subway, Chick-fil-a and a salad bar in the Student Center. The new dinning hall in North Ave is beautiful and the food has improved (compared to Woodruff and Brittain dinning halls)."
College Sophomore,2,"In order to switch into my current major I was required to take a certain number of courses within the department which required a permit, attend a meeting, have a form signed by both my current and future advisors, and maintain a high GPA. Most majors I think are easier to switch into or out of, but that was my experience."
College Sophomore,2,"Most students take part in social drinking or drug use to cope with the ridiculously heavy workload. However, there are many students who choose to abstain and usually do not experience much peer pressure if they don't join a Greek organization."
College Sophomore,2,Super expensive in the city and not a lot within walking distance (especially when you consider how important walking distance is in a city notorious for awful traffic problems).
College Freshman,2,The wifi poops out all the time.
College Freshman,2,It's hard to get in touch with people that know what they're talking about.
College Sophomore,2,This winter is would be 6 degrees and there were several ice storms which caused many cancellations and forced saturday school. It was just never consistent and made it hard to go to class
College Sophomore,2,I had a bad experience with on campus house. Mold was growing everywhere in my room and all of my belongings stayed damp. All housing did was bring in a dehumidifier and a HEPA filter. They refused to give a refund and wouldn't relocate me.
College Junior,2,"Unless you are a minority, expect to receive little to no aid."
College Student,2,I live in a square
College Senior,2,"Apparently the bar is quite low to be an RA or member of on-campus housing. Students can be irreverent, messy, loud, and otherwise unpleasant, and the staff cannot be bothered to help you. Proximity to campus and friends is probably the only perk, as everything else is crazy and bureaucratically incompetent."
College Freshman,2,"Look for outside scholarships cause unless you're a minority (either Hispanic or Black), you won't receive anything. You can try to work with the system, but it's better to avoid on-campus housing and/or meal plan to save a few dollars from the overall cost of attendance. Institute scholarships are hard to come by and most often, those with a slightly higher GPA will automatically get the scholarship so trying is relatively pointless. Take out a loan from a bank rather than with the Institute and/or apply for an on-campus job."
College Freshman,2,"Professors do give a bunch of busy work, but many of the courses offered are interesting and influential in different majors.The registration process is hectic where spaces fill-up FAST, but resources online aid in creating the perfect schedule. Popular study areas are mainly the Clough Undergraduate Commons and the College of Computing, but even dorms provide nice areas of study. With the workload quite heavy, there are many tutoring and educational resources on-campus to help students with academic needs."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is so unpredictable that it can ruin your week, or make it the best week of your college experience. It can go from rainy and dreary one day,  to completely sunny and warm the next day. Unless you've packed clothes for every situation, you might have a hard time dealing with the weather here."
College Sophomore,2,"If you don't have financial need, its almost impossible to get scholarships. Which I think is unfair, no one today can actually ""afford"" college. I think if I'm a highly active member of our school, head of several organizations, 3.8 gpa, doing research in two labs... I deserve some kind of scholarship. But its as if, if you don't receive a scholarship your freshman year, no matter how well you do at Tech, you won't be receiving anything."
College Freshman,2,Took me a long time to receive aid form outside scholarships.
College Junior,2,Financial aid is difficult to get through Georgia Tech unless you are near the poverty line.  I highly recommend looking into outside scholarships.
College Junior,2,Most students are busy with school work load 
College Sophomore,2,Very expensive on campus parking. Would recommend you leave your wheels at home.
College Sophomore,2,I do not like the weather. It's cold during the winter and wet.
College Sophomore,2,"You can never predict it. One day it will be sunny and 75 with a low of 55. The next it will raining, high of 50 and a low of 35."
College Sophomore,2,"Once you switch off meal plan, nearly no one goes back. I think that says something..."
College Sophomore,2,"Not nearly enough, but my parent's are ""sucking it up"" and footing the bill, even though it is significantly affecting their retirement."
College Freshman,2,Parking is outragously expensive and parking is very limited. 
College Sophomore,2,I have the state-given scholarship for if you maintain a 3.3 during the first 4 years.
College Sophomore,2,"It's really expensive to park on campus and not too convenient to park off campus, but if you happen to have a permit on campus, it's not too bad to find a spot."
College Junior,2,"I've had an internship but it wasn't through Georgia Tech. It was super boring, but the pay is decent. With Georgia Tech and your resume, you are essentially a prime candidate for any job out there that doesn't require very specific skills."
College Senior,2,"My major is very strange because it seems the further I go into it, the less teachers know what they're talking about. The intro courses were math based and easier to teach. Once the problems begin to get harder and harder, most of the teachers try to stumble upon answers that aren't necessarily right or wrong. In some ways this is a good thing because it forces students to try to figure out solutions that make sense for credit rather than there being a definite right or wrong answers. In one way this prepares you for real life, but in another sense it can be very frustrating not knowing definitively if your solution is entirely correct."
College Senior,2,"If I could do it again, I would pick Business Administration. As an Industrial Engineer, I feel like my major and the business track cross paths a lot. I appreciate that IE at my school is number 1 in the country but I would have rather have gone to another school and excelled in a business degree looking back on things."
College Senior,2,"If you're not rich, parking is a pretty stressful."
College Sophomore,2,"Georgia Tech is great at accomodating in-state students because the state of Georgia offers the Hope and Zell Miller scholarships. For out of state students, the tuition is rather expensive. Georgia Tech does not do much to help out the out-of-state students leaving it very difficult to pay for school."
College Freshman,2,"It was unclear to me that I had to send a message to the financial aid office telling them that I modified my application, so I am two days from the deadline for final payment and have not gotten my aid yet. It is supposed to be good, but I'm not going to have enough aid to be able to get it in once place. I'm going to have to get some outside private bank help, also."
College Junior,2,The parking permit price is ridiculous. $700 a year is just way too much to pay for a chance to get a parking spot in a parking lot.
College Sophomore,2,"You are not really going to go to Georgia Tech to find the most attractive person ever.  Although there are plenty of very attractive men and women, it does not compare to other schools.  The ratio of guys to girls is high (plenty of dudes).  But a lot of people are very nerdy and do not tend to go out to parties much, so at parties it is a fairly even ratio."
College Freshman,2,"Sure, you have nice frat parties here or there, but all of them will probably disappoint you in some major way. There could be too many people (males in particular), music that no one can dance to, or fraternity brothers refuse to let people into the party. Overall, the nightlife becomes much better if you actually join a fraternity or are very close with many brothers at a certain fraternity. The male:female ratio is really brought out during parties though. Transportation at night is pretty decent with the Midnight Rambler, as well as the Stingerette--where you can customize your start and end points. If you want to go to club, try going to one that isn't too close to campus otherwise the ratio will once again shine bright before your eyes!"
College Junior,2,"There are three dining halls, a food court in the Student Center, and restaurants on campus as well. The dining halls are all overpriced and sub par, and the food court is generally overcrowded and has limited options. The restaurants are very nice, though. Meal plans are quite expensive, and usually not worth their cost.

A main problem is that a company called Sodexo has a monopoly of almost all the dining places on campus with the exception of some private restaurants. There have been many initiatives by the students to try to influence what we will be offered to eat, but Sodexo and the administration rarely take us seriously."
College Freshman,2,"There's this thing called ""tech goggles"" which is a popular term referring to what one grows accustomed to seeing when on the Tech campus. The ratio is approximately 70% men and 30% women, which is not favorable to the men, who use the term to refer to when a male Tech student finds a female Tech student attractive, who is indeed not attractive when compared to the overall scope of women."
College Freshman,2,"Guys are average looking, girls are average looking. It's a good match when the average looking people find each other. However, there are outliers for both sides. You get the gorgeous (and smart) southern belles, and the athletic cute frat boys here and there. But since they know they are pretty, their egos get inflated and no one wants to date them anyway. Rough life."
College Freshman,2,"There's sometimes stuff to do. In general as long as you've got some money to spend and some friends to spend it with, you can generally find a good time. Usually, the best times are had by people who drink, but if alcohol's not your thing you can go other places though."
College Freshman,2,Atlanta parking in general cost more because of the metro area and Georgia Tech is not an exception. Parking permits are around 600-650 a year.
College Freshman,2,"The saying about finding a man is ""the odds are good but the goods are odd,"" but I think the one for guys looking for a girl should be ""the odds are bad but the bads are worse."" In general the boys are sweet and there's certainly a pool of attractive boys, but don't have high hopes for Prince Charming. As a girl, I can say that most of the girls at Tech aren't gorgeous. There are, of course, pretty girls, but they're not be most common thing. And girls tend to have a very inflated sense of self, so look out for that."
College Junior,2,"Lots of nerdy and foreign guys, not a lot of good looking girls."
Graduate Student,1,"Their communication is awful.  It takes them forever to respond to communication attempts and when they do respond, they do not answer your question.  Processes are unnecessarily difficult with little to no help when encountering issues."
Sophomore,1,Academics are good but they literally don't care about your health at all. Even when you have doctors' notes or physical or mental health problems they literally don't give a shit and won't help you. There's a reason so many people kill themselves here...
Senior,1,"I liked the diversity but hated the academic environment. Georgia Tech was one of the most toxic environments I've ever experienced, and I was born in Detroit. People shouldn't have competitions over who is suffering the most or whose mental health is the worst. I can't wait until I leave this hellhole."
Freshman,1,"Georgia Tech is a horrible school. The environment is so stressful and everyone is so negative that it’s hard to be happy or enjoy yourself. I thought classes were easy last semester but I ultimately transferred because the campus vibe was so awful. The dining halls are nasty and have few options if you have dietary restrictions, and the dorms are tiny and riddled with cockroaches. I found the student body to be rather unfriendly and snobby while I was at Tech. I transferred after one semester because my experience was so horrible."
Alum,1,GT has no job for you after graduation.  Surrounding manufacturing is non existent.  Only computer science grads do well.
College Senior,1,"Georgia Tech is notoriously stingy and does not help its students financially. A very small subset of the student population is aided in the form of presidential scholarship or a hispanic scholarship. Georgia Tech knows the programs are highly rated and students will flock to the school regardless of cost, which is why the bursar's office probably doesn't see the need to assist its students."
College Freshman,1,No aid for international students
College Sophomore,1,"Applying for and obtaining financial aid is easy. However, the type and amount of financial aid is abysmal. This is not the type of school you want to attend if you plan on going to college with a full ride. In fact, I don't even believe that's possible unless you get PLENTY of external scholarships. The complete tuition, room and board is harsh (thankfully this is a public school so Zell Miller covers tuition) and don't expect free money from the school."
College Freshman,1,They give you no money. I'm in-state and all I got was the Georgia HOPE scholarship. Georgia Tech themselves gave me no aid.
College Freshman,1,No scholarships whatsoever for out-of-state students!
College Junior,1,Parking is extremely expensive and the office that deals with it is a total joke. 
College Junior,1,Very expensive and not a good deal. 
College Junior,1,There is NO aid for out-of-state students and they purposely classify them as out-of-state to keep charging them higher tuition. 
College Sophomore,1,Parking is $800 a year and they crack down within minutes on illegal parkers.
College Senior,1,"If you are an athlete at Georgia Tech make sure its a varsity sport.  Varsity sports get scholarships, free tutoring, and housing priority.  Club sports are completely ignored and have to fight for every penny. We have to match in fundraising every dime SGA gives to the club.  The budget is hard to get passed with GT pressing the committee to not spend on Club Sports."
College Junior,1,"Parking passes are really expensive and there are very few places to park. Even with a parking pass, you could still get ticketed at any time"
College Freshman,1,"It is very difficult to receive a scholarship from the college itself. It is hard to obtain grants or scholarships from the college. The only financial aid I have received was from the state of Georgia. However, the financial aid process is very seamless and thorough. I was able to receive the financial aid from the state smoothly."
College Freshman,1,I didn't receive any financial aid even though I applie for it and followed up on it trough multiple emails. The financial aid office is not very helpful. It's harder to find financial aid at a public school. One tip I would give is start looking as soon as you get accepted.
College Junior,1,"Parking fees are extremely high, and the Parking and Transportation frequently changes rules unnecessarily."
College Junior,1,Be prepared to spend most of your time studying...the professors meet before the school year to figure out how much work they can give to fill up your out of class time.

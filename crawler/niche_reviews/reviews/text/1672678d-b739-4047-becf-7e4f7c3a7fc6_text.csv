Sophomore,5,What I like about Eastern Nazarene college is that it is a great school. We have the most caring students and staffs. It provides a good education and make sure that their students are well taking care of.
Freshman,5,Very nice college in a wonderful location. Everyone is friendly and open. So far this seems like a great place.
Freshman,5,"Great School with great people. Pretty good academics, and close proximity to  Boston. I have met so many great people here and I can't wait to continue my education here."
College Freshman,5,People there are care and helpful. They willing to help everyone regardless of your physical appearance.
College Sophomore,5,Before I even attended my first day of classes I had a job on campus. The cafeteria is alway hiring and other job opportunities such as the school mailroom and teacher aid positions often come along as well. Allowing students to work on campus during their time at ENC gives them a feel for what life will be like working after. Opportunities such as being a lab aid for a professor give students extremely good work history to put on their resumes for applying to graduate school.
College Sophomore,5,"Choosing to attend Eastern Nazarene College was by far the best decision about my college career that I have made. As soon as I stepped foot on campus I felt welcomed and at home. Although it is a small campus, I have found that many different opportunities have come my way that I would not have had at a larger institution. Class sizes usually fall around 20-25 students. Larger classes rarely reach more than 50 students and are often only so full because they are general education courses."
College Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere at ENC is amazing on campus and off! It is very easy to attend Red Sox, Bruins, and Celtics games. The MBTA makes travel to and from the City extremely convenient without having to worry about parking because the school is only a short walk away from the nearest stop. There are several different assortments of cuisine in the area for students to chose from."
College Freshman,5,"I'm a science major, and science is great in ENC. We have some great professors for math chem and biology."
College Freshman,5,"ENC has a 94% acceptance rate into Medical School and Veterinary School--I hope to get into vet school and I know that if I can get through this bio program, I am very likely to do so."
College Senior,5,"You have to sign a contract saying you will not partake in such activities while you are enrolled at ENC. But people still do it, just not on campus. Most of the time. "
Recent Alumnus,5,"There are many majors to choose from at Eastern Nazarene. And I have been doing great with my education and feel very satisfied with the education I am receiving at this college. All the professors I have had have been out in the field I would like to work in so they are bringing their own experience to class as well as teaching by the books, they are also eager to provide tips to students to help with our experience."
Recent Alumnus,5,Quincy is a pretty big town and not too far of a commute to Boston which is a big city with many things to do. Although Quincy also has a lot to offer if students don't want to travel outside of the city.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I've never felt safer on a college campus than I felt at ENC. Security is constantly around, and they use a lot of graduates on security, so they are familiar faces with a good knowledge of the campus. 

There's very little crime. The only problem I can think of is non-students who sneak in with students to play basketball, but security is pretty good about kicking them out. I wish the school would do something about them, though, because they always come back and security can only make them leave.

That would be my only complaint."
Recent Alumnus,5,The Campus Police are always driving around campus and they have a non tolerance policy for violence.
Recent Alumnus,5,You are able to have a car and if not applicable the Bat Bus runs through the campus at all different times. There is also a bicycle rack. And a drop off pick up location is in a designated place.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I can always find parking, it doesn't cost anything to park, I have never received a ticket or heard of anyone who has."
Recent Alumnus,5,The Health and Safety environment is great and all students feel safe and are using all the correct precautions to any health issues
College Senior,5,the Public transportation system is really good the school itself is no more than 6 minutes away form the train station.
College Junior,5,"ENC has a very diverse student population. There are people from all walks of live, believers, non-believers etc."
College Junior,5,The atmosphere is peaceful. It's quiet and you don't have to worry about noise.
College Freshman,5,There are plenty of computers and they're kept in nice condition.
College Sophomore,5,"The social work program is one of the best programs
I haven't face many difficulties 
Stay in touch with admissions"
College Freshman,5,The safety and security here at ENC is wonderful. The security people are always around when you need them and they make me feel really safe at night when walking on campus.
College Freshman,5,"I don't go to campus, but have lived in Massachusetts my whole life it's just New England Weather it changes so often you'll never know what to expect sometimes."
College Freshman,5,"I am in the Early Childhood Education bachalor degree program, in Brockton Ma. It's so helpful it's close to my house. This is my third class, and I have had the same professor. He's great so helpful and makes me believe that I can do this program even though I am older and haven't been at school in 16 years! I hope this program contiunes so others can join."
College Freshman,5,The professor I have is great. This is my thrid class and they all have been with him. I am an older person going back to school and it's hard to do. I am so happy Eastern Nazarene offers this program.
College Freshman,5,The drug scene here at ENC is not a problem at all. It all depends on who you ask. I have not seen anyone do any drugs while here on campus. There may have been a few issues with peer pressure when it comes to doing something you are not comfortable doing.
College Freshman,5,"There are many options of transportation in and near ENC. The most common use of transportation to nearby areas is the T, a subway train that is easily accessible and close to the college. It is easy to get to and cheap to take a ride into the Boston area."
College Senior,5,"There are tons of places, even without a car. Just on the way to the T, which is about a 10-15 minute walk, there is Pad-Thai, Papa Gino's and Tony's Pizza, Newcomb Farms (an awesome breakfast place!), Fuji (a sushi place), Great Chow, KFC/Taco Bell, Friendly's and there's always 7/11 (though it's not the cheapest option)... Then if you go toward the beach there a bunch of good seafood places. Most of the time if you walk down Hancock St you can find good options that may be a little past the T but still only between 10 and 20 minutes to walk...which is healthy for you :-), and if you have a car you can drive 5 minutes to Panera Bread or Apple Bee's. There is this hidden gem on Hancock called the Wheelhouse diner, and it has cheap and delicious food (I always go there for breakfast) There are really a ton of options, and if you are looking for healthy food you can definitely find it :-)"
College Sophomore,5,"I must say returning to school after being out of school for 7 yrs, Eastern Nazarene has helped me completely in transitioning back to school mode. I must say that I was completely procrastinating on enrolling myself into school because I have sat out for so long. But once I got in, realized there were other students that have been out longer then me & the classes to help you transition were awesome. The workload is a lot but it follows the program. I have thought about changing schools but I am so set in this program that I have decided to just stay until I am finish. Last but not least, the staff are GREAT. They are kind & are willing to work with you under any condition."
College Sophomore,5,"The academics at our school are top notch! The professors challenge their students to go above and beyond what is expected of them. They are extremely intelligent and interested in their subject matters. The curriculum gives students a broad range of education outside of their course of study as well. The registration process is simple and easy for students! The workload is manageable yet challenging, and the use of Supplemental Instructions at the Center for Academic Success are a wonderful resource on campus! The on-campus library (also home to the Center for Academic Success) is a popular study area for students."
College Sophomore,5,"Love the New Imacs! The new iMac computers in the library and classroom are excellent for students! I have a MacBook Pro, so having other computers available to transfer information and resources is extremely helpful!"
College Sophomore,5,"Quincy is situated only minutes from the main hub of Boston.  There is so much culture and diversity situated between Quincy and Boston.  The freedom trail, winning sports teams, historical museums and diverse restaurants make up the surrounding of this College."
College Freshman,5,"Always Available – The computers available at Eastern Nazarene College are easily accessible and effective. The Wifi however, is not so great. But overall, the ENC provided computers are great."
College Freshman,5,"The Campus – The campus is very small. Most of the buildings are small, and old.  The builds are very homey and welcoming."
College Freshman,5,The campus security is excelant. I have no problems at all with it!!
College Sophomore,5,"Plethora of Possibilities – The greater Boston area has numerous things to do including, but not limited to, whale watches, visits to historic sites, several excellent museums, and the most selection of restaurants available."
College Junior,5,"Eastern Nazarene College is a short 10 minute subway ride from Boston. There are many museums and parks to explore in the day time, and at night there are plenty of places for college students to enjoy the night. There are malls everywhere so there are a variety of choices."
College Junior,5,"Great Group of Ppl – ENC/Eastern Nazarene College has a great group of mature, morale, fun-loving kids from all walks of life.  Everyone is accepting of others, even if the others are different, with different tastes/opinions/etc.  Everyone is there for a good, solid, Bible-based education, both in and out of the classroom.  The campus is beautiful, the staff is warm/open/caring.  Everyone knows everyone on a 1st name basis, but aren't ""into"" all of your ""personal business"".  The accomodations are good for the most part, although some of the dorms could use some updating."
College Junior,5,"The Shuttles Are Great – The transportation around campus are wonderful. It's right outside of Boston, so we are a 15 minute's walk from the Red Line. There's another campus where some classes are held, but there's a regular shuttle that runs back and from from the Main Campus to Old Colony, as it's called. You know exactly where it's going to be a when and you don't have to risk losing your parking space unless you want to."
Senior,4,"I took a few classes online. The content was still great because many supplemental readings were available before conducting assignments. Assignments were fairly difficult, but more difficult when taken with another online class. Leniency is also offered if balancing with other classes is difficult."
Alum,4,I just experienced online learning during the time of COVID-19. I think ENC did a good job conveying information and learning material.
Alum,4,I think it was too Christian but I enjoyed being on the tennis team as well as leading the campus newspaper and yearbook as the director.
Freshman,4,"There's a great sense of community at this small school in Quincy, It's very safe, has great diversity, is close to Boston, needs some updating/renovations."
Freshman,4,"I love this place. It is a great school. The teachers are down to earth and want to connect with students on a personal level. lastly, the campus is beautiful."
Sophomore,4,"I never wanted a big school, and first visiting ENC showed me that I was right to think so. The atmosphere was any typical college type except a more homey feel. The student-professor ratio is about 10:1 creating the perfect classroom. Student life was filled with activities that everyone can enjoy. Athletics are always a good match up and create a good time. Overall, ENC showed me as student that christ and education fit very nicely together."
College Junior,4,Keep up the good work!!
College Junior,4,The cable tv doesn't work in my building but other than that it's fine
College Junior,4,I wish they would help me more getting an internship in my field outside of the school
College Junior,4,"The students are involved in athletics, going to games, keeping up the spirit"
College Sophomore,4,Lots of non alcohol and music clubs around in city just off the T
College Sophomore,4,Scholarships are kind if present at ENC but even more present if you're Nazarene or a pastors child...
College Sophomore,4,"The ENC campus is located only two miles outside of Boston. Many different restaurants and events are open and take place during the evening and often late into the night. While most students at ENC choose to stay on campus to study during the typical college night life, Boston is a very close and convenient MBTA ride away for those who want to go out and have some fun."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus has very strict rules on alcohol and drug use. Anyone attending the university, wether of age or not, is not permitted to drink alcohol or use drugs. It is a smoke-free campus. There are strict visiting hours when students of the opposite gender are allowed into the dorms of members of the opposite sex. The campus is a Nazarene (Cristian) based campus, so they follow strictly by the faith and the rules that the Nazarene church has set up to guide everyone into living more holy and fulfilled lives."
College Sophomore,4,"The institution has focused special attention on making top-notch study areas for students. They have individual study rooms that can be reserved for individual and group study sessions. They also enforce quite hours in the dorms so that students can study or sleep without being distracted or kept up. The cafeteria and student center are being kept up to date with renovations that have taken place over the summer of 2014. As a member of the tennis team, I can speak for everyone when saying that the athletic department is one of our best; everyone is extremely friendly and caring. The college has recently converted to using only natural gas for heat and has installed solar panels on several different buildings throughout the campus to provide green energy."
College Senior,4,"There isn't much to do in Quincy, but living 20 minutes from Boston is a plus"
College Senior,4,"The basketball games get the most attention, but it makes sense because there is no football and it's the easiest game to attend."
College Senior,4,"I may have some problems with ENC, but overall I love the school. It's a beautiful campus with a small amount of people so it's pretty top notch. ENC is a good school."
College Senior,4,"I feel pretty safe on campus, it's a pretty good set up"
College Senior,4,ENC is very diverse which is pretty awesome
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy my school's programs.
College Sophomore,4,Being a biology major can be challenging but totally worth it.
College Sophomore,4,It's close to school .
College Sophomore,4,There's a variety of academics at my school.
College Sophomore,4,Printing is free and there's always available computers at the library.
College Sophomore,4,Transportation is great when you want to go shopping or out for dinner in Boston.
College Sophomore,4,"Eastern Nazarene College is a very strict when it comes to drinking,drugs and visiting the opposite sex's dorm."
College Sophomore,4,I love Eastern Nazarene College . I have had great experiences.
College Sophomore,4,"An internship is great . I have learned a lot about the medical field. I do not get paid , but I enjoy helping and learning."
College Sophomore,4,"I would do all over again , it's great . My career goals is to obtain a job in the health field to pay off my loans."
College Sophomore,4,The off-campus dining is convenient. We have fast foods and Chinese restaurants.
College Sophomore,4,"For commuters it is definitely hard. But other than that it's great because everything (classes,library etc.) is close by."
College Sophomore,4,Being a biology major is great at my school. Professors care and are always willing to help.
College Sophomore,4,"I personally love living on campus because you have an advantage . For example , it is easier for you to attend any class sessions after 6pm , the library closes at midnight which is great for studying ."
College Sophomore,4,The atmosphere is great . College is beautiful and students are friendly.
College Freshman,4,"admission process is pretty good. They are really helpful. 

i believe they want students to go here, that way people would know there is something called ENC in quincy. i applied 2 weeks before the school started and i was still able to get in."
College Freshman,4,"if you are a science major, or something has to do with science, you are good to go."
College Freshman,4,"since its a really small campus, people are aware of sports events, and they show up to the events. Once again, this is only for people who live on campus. Commuters are barely aware about things/ events thats happening in school."
College Freshman,4,"comparing to the number of students, i think there is enough computers."
College Freshman,4,They have a great attitude towards people receiving scholarships and it seems to me that they give fairly generously.  I had an issue transferring in where my GPA sunk below the 3.5 mark they had initially offered me and they still gave me the highest aid available for transfer students without concern.
College Sophomore,4,I wouldn't say its horrible here. It happens everywhere it could be soo much worse.
College Sophomore,4,Everything is specific to your major I like that!!
College Senior,4,"I love the Biology department, I love all the professors especially Prof. Burt she has made me love being a Biology major more than anyone else in the department. "
College Senior,4,"there are actually no Greeks on our campus, we don't have sororities and fraternities "
College Senior,4,We are in a pretty safe part of town so I don't really worry about my safety that often. 
College Senior,4,"I think that the student body really comes together when we support our athletic programs, being on both the varsity volleyball and softball teams really allows me to become friends with a lot of different people only because they approach me to tell me good game or to talk about the game. "
Recent Alumnus,4,The facilities on campus are great the library is close and welcoming also the public library it great to go to as well. There is an athletic center on campus for students to take advantage of! There are always many campus activities going on so students have many choices to make and are rarely bored.
Recent Alumnus,4,Most of the professors I have had are great with the material they teach and the students are understanding what is being taught so that great but some teachers I feel are being kept on the staff because they are alumni and maybe the administration feels bad about getting rid of them or even because the professors have been with the school for so long. I am not saying they are bad teachers I just think they could use an update in their own material and how to teach to modern day students.
College Senior,4,I like the curriculum the school offers. The teachers are not laid back like other professors.
College Senior,4,The local atmosphere in Eastern Nazarene College is quite and rural town.
College Sophomore,4,its a dry campus but its got a lot to do in boston
College Sophomore,4,The school is so safe. My only concern is the lack of back up help in situations such as the storm this past winter.
College Sophomore,4,The public transportation is very convenient and cheap.
College Junior,4,The specific I like is the Lead program for Adult learners. Its provides a  way to earn a degree in an accelerated rate.
College Junior,4,"Since college campus is near a church, The last thing you have to worry about is drug safety.  Students are more focused on their studies.  Anyway, there is more ways to have fun than to get stoned."
College Junior,4,"The library has mac desktops, IT services, tutoring services, an arts and crafts section, book sales, a computer lab with about 30 computers, and services available to any public patron who has a library card."
College Freshman,4,"There are all kinds of places to eat off campus in Quincy, or you can walk to the T to bring you into Boston, and a short drive away there is also a mall.  If you have to money to go out to eat I would recommend it"
College Freshman,4,It has been snowing almost every weekend since we had the blizzard. It makes it hard to do things on campus. The only part about the weather that I didn't like was when we lost power for a whole 24 hours. It made my dorm room cold and I wasn't able to do much homework.
College Freshman,4,The diversity here on Campus is great. I have met new people who are different from me when it comes to their racial diversity and their economic backgrounds are different then mine is
College Freshman,4,"For the most part, drugs and alcohol are completely unavailable. Some students may sneak it in from time to time, but it is not tolerated."
College Freshman,2,Its a sham. Came here for a turf field that will not be here until after I have my first kid and a specific coach who ended up being a hell of a salesmen.
College Junior,2,a little better than highschool sports
College Junior,2,chinese or some kind of asian food.  and KFC
College Freshman,2,"very beat-up inner city, but has Boston near by"
College Freshman,2,Its  not structured well at this school
College Senior,2,"ENC doesn't let very many people live off campus, they prefer the big brother approach and like to know whats going on with every student."
College Freshman,2,"People claim here that ENC is a diverse campus. according to me diverse is defined as something, where other cutures and beliefs are welcomed and appreciated. But here its all about one being christian and following gods path."
College Freshman,2,"Waaayyy too strict. They think (and I guess can) control us. The opposite gender is only allowed in your dorm at certain times (usually two days a week from 6-10, except Young apartments, which are M-F...5-10 or something) and only then can they be in your room with the door open and the lights on--RA's patrol the hallways the whole time.  Drinking is not allowed at anytime while enrolled at ENC, with an exception of the summers, per the covenant you sign at the beginning of the year. The punishments are pretty strict, but there is not much drinking/ drug use--certainly not much that is talked about."
College Freshman,2,"It's a small school, so this is to be expected, but not having many focuses in majors is an issue. And double majoring is practically impossible because they're all so different--nothing overlaps except the GE's, which we ALL have to take. The same ones. There's no room for choice in the matter."
College Sophomore,2,If you like asian food and fast food you are set here.
College Sophomore,2,Nothing really makes it stand out from any other school.
College Sophomore,2,Nearby is really nothing unless you go into Boston but other than that Quincy is really weird.
College Senior,2,They only have one parking lot for on campus students. It's ridiculous.
College Sophomore,2,"I would give diversity at ENC a C because the numbers say that it is the most diverse  Christian College there is in America. But I am still a minority when it comes to my race (African-American) and my Sexual Orientation. There are black and Latinos in my school but we are obviously the minority. And it frustrates me that we are separated. The only diverse group there is on campus is the athletic groups due to the nature of college recruitment. I also identify as a Black, Bisexual woman and that makes things even more difficult for me. Especially since ENC is a Christian college."
College Sophomore,2,They really don't give out that much financial aid. A lot of people cant afford school and this school expensive and we get no help. They would have more people if it were more financially manageable.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Nothing spectacular. The people who work in the caf are amazing, but the food gets old fast. It is also hard if you have allergies."
College Junior,2,"Most everyone on campus is white, and we're all Christian. Granted it is a Christian College, so this is to be expected. There is a growing number of African American Students, but the numbers are still small. The school is not the safest place for those whom have a sexual orientation that is not heterosexual."
College Freshman,2,There are quite a lot of international students and racially we are diverse
College Freshman,2,"I understand that this is a Christian campus but sometimes I feel like I have more of a babysitter than I do guidance. Seriously, I should be trusted to stay in a guys room during the day hours and I feel like a lot of the authority expects the worst out of students sometimes. But it does help to keep the trouble down, I just wish I had more freedom at times."
College Freshman,2,There Is None – At ENC there is no night life because it is a christian college.
Graduate Student,1,"I have many comments. I should first mention that I am in a graduate program. They are very unorganized, untimely, and unrealistic. Most graduate students currently hold a full-time job, which they seem to neglect. Also, to add to the unorganized, someone dropped the ball on health insurance. Myself and many others were charged for health Inaurance repeatedly after opting out. As for the unrealistic comment, the college includes the textbooks in tuition (you can opt out- you should opt out!), and the amount of work is not doable with a full-time job. I would not be complaining about this, however most of the ""work"" that was assigned felt more like insignificant ""busy work"".  If I am going to pay copious amounts of money to receive a graduate degree, I would prefer to do meaningful studies and purposeful work. I would not recommend this college to anyone. You can pay less for a better education at your local community College."
Graduate Student,1,"See previous comments. The overall experience with ENC has been subpar, starting with unclear expectations and a misleading start."
Sophomore,1,"Eastern Nazarene is a horrible college, I would not recommend this college to any one. The professors are horrible and the cafeteria food is disgusting. All the money they receive, it’s funded into the church on campus. Bad living conditions."
College Freshman,1,Get out as soon as you can before you turn into one of them.
College Freshman,1,Greek life doesn't deserve to be on this campus.
College Junior,1,nazzy rules enforced by adminstrators who treat students like they are children. (rather than teach them responsibility)
College Junior,1,"ugly dorms, falling apart.  heat works half the time.  took a year to put a new roof on a dorm.  why?  no money?"
College Junior,1,no party no fun all naz
College Junior,1,off campus housing is expensive and not allowed
College Junior,1,school sucks.  anyone get in.  lots of closed minded people.  lots of gossip and back stabbing.  buildings are ugly and falling apart.
College Freshman,1,"Way to strict, feels more like a highschool"
College Freshman,1,We are terrible at every sport except basketball.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek Life
College Sophomore,1,"Obtaining off-campus housing during undergraduate years at Eastern Nazarene College is extremely difficult. There are certain requirements that must be met before someone is allowed to live off-campus; for example one can either live with a family member in the area, or be over the age of 25 (which most undergraduates aren't). The cost and convince of living on campus make it not worth arguing to try to get permission from the school to live off campus."
College Senior,1,"While Spange and Willy are pretty great, Monroe has got to go. That place looks ready to collapse the next time the wind picks up a little more than average. It's a gross building that I'm pretty sure isn't even up to code."
College Sophomore,1,The school is the worst . Always the same thing .
College Freshman,1,"PEople said, they offer you same kind of food every week. May be once in a blue moon, they have something special."
College Freshman,1,"this is a christian campus, so drinking and smoking and parties are strictly prohibited on campus."
College Freshman,1,"It's a Nazarene school. To find nightlife, you have to go off-campus."
College Freshman,1,"People try to tell me ENC is diverse and I just don't see it. Okay, so there are both black and white students and maybe like ten Asians, but...that's about it. Religious diversity (obviously) is almost non-existent other than types of Evangelical Christianity. If you identify with LGBT, please don't come here. I would love to see ENC become more LGBT friendly, but it's against Nazarene beliefs, for reasons with which I disagree. Discrimination definitely will not stand here, but no one is making it easy on any diversity. I come from a very accepting background and this is one of the most frustrating aspects of the campus life I face."

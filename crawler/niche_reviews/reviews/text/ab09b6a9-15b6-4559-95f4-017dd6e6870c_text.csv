Junior,5,"When switching to online for COVID, our professors made it as easy as possible to try to have the same amount of things to do so that our education wasn’t jeopardized."
Junior,5,They have an AMAZING nursing program! The teachers work with you so much so that you are doing your best every time. They take time out of their schedule to come in extra to help you if you ask them. Love the school!
Freshman,5,"It was amazing visit, the students and staff was really nice. They have a lot of good opportunities at this college."
Niche User,5,"I would not want to see anything change at Thomas more University it is amazing. Thomas More makes you feel like you are wanted and needed. Everyone gets along, and everyone on campus knows each other. You wont go a day there with a frown upon your face someone will make you smile and laugh."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small campus and small class sizes, but I wish there was more parking for students.  Campus feels safe.  Everyone is very helpful and welcoming.  The college does a great job of welcoming first year students."
Junior,5,I am currently enrolled in their TAP program working towards finishing my BA. They are all online which works well with working full time and family commitments.
Sophomore,5,"I have had a great experience at Thomas More. I am going to be a sophomore in the fall. I am an education major with a secondary history concentration. I love the small community, and how it is easy to get around campus without getting lost."
Sophomore,5,I enjoy the small school feel with average class sizes for undergrads at 25-1. The people are friendly and classes typically well thought out in timing and content.
Freshman,5,"One thing I love about Thomas More is that everyone knows almost everyone. It reminds me a lot of my high school In that regard. I also love the fact that all of my classes are in one building so when it is cold or raining outside I don't have to walk a mile in the weather conditions to get to my next class. Since Thomas More is a small college, it really feels like were one big family achieving our academic and career dreams. The staff always makes sure we are doing everything possible to pursue our dreams."
Senior,5,Thomas More College is the place to be to excel in academics and athletics at the same time. It allowed me to grow as a leader on the court during sports and in the classroom. There is nothing better than getting a degree while playing a college sport and maintaining a high GPA.
Sophomore,5,"Thomas More College is an amazing college. The class sizes are small, scheduled is flexible, and perfect of full and part time student."
Freshman,5,"I am enrolled in TAP (The Accelerated Program) It is for adults who have been out of school for awhile and have lived a little bit of live who have decided to finally go back to achieve a higher education. I love it! This was the only school I found that fits perfectly with my wants and needs. I only go to campus once a week and the rest I can do online. It is speedy so I will be able to earn my BBA by 2020. And all the teachers and staff are super friendly and helpful. They are a little more expensive than most schools but I figured since I'll be in debt either way, might as well go for the best!"
Niche User,5,"Great small school. Individualized attention. Beautiful campus. Helpful staff. If you're looking for a small, tight knit community, this is a great choice."
Freshman,5,I like Thomas More because it's a smaller school and you meet a lot more people and I think it's so much nicer than going to a big school and only meeting a couple people
College Sophomore,5,"Overall, I think the value of a degree from Thomas More College is greater than a degree from many schools because when someone has discovered you obtained a degree from Thomas More College they know you earned a great degree with a slid education."
College Sophomore,5,I love all of the professors and my ability to connect with them!  They are very available and always want the best for their students.  The courses are challenging but that is expected.
College Sophomore,5,I am in Greek life and I love it.  We are not seen negatively but we are a small school so not a lot of people are involved.  We are trying to get more involvement on campus.
College Freshman,5,"There is no crime on campus and parties happen only in the wet hall, Murphy. Campus police does not bust parties because they are not well known and most times off campus. Health is good. But because campus is so small, if someone gets sick and goes out, it does spread easily. "
College Sophomore,5,"I feel I would have a wonderful advantage to an internship because going to an extremely small school I have a more personal connection with my professors. They all know what my best option would be, the best direction for me to take, and they could hook me up with some of their own personal connections because they know me as a person, not just a student."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the art room. I do my english, my history, my math homework, everything in the art department. It feels like home to me. It is the most confortable place in the building for me to be. I know everyone, and there is plenty of room for me to be down there even if there is a class happening."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the school, professors, students, and the environment that comes with the school. Everyone is friendly and doesn't mind answering questions about anything. The food int the cafeteria could be better but the food in the Interlude isn't too bad, just takes a little long to get some days. They professors really care about you doing well in their classes and most of them will help you however they can and give you extensions if you are out of town for a sport or anything like that."
Junior,4,All schools can use improvement but I’m very satisfied with my school. Professors are agreeable to questions and conversations about classes. I have a great advisor helping me make connections. Lots of opportunities to get involved. Will graduate in four years with Business Administration degree and MIS minor.
Junior,4,"Thomas More University is great for people that like small class sizes and very involved professors. The faculty really care about helping make sure you succeed. There is only one academic building so classes are not very difficult to find. Most people are super friendly so they wouldn't mind showing you around if you had trouble. The athletic facilities could use some improvement, but there is also a gym next to campus that is free for students to use."
Freshman,4,Its a very good university. It has a lot of fun activities. They have good foods and services. People are very friendly there.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Thomas More is how easy it is to get help from your professors. If you cant make there office hours and you email them, they will make arrangements to meet you at another time.  Change, because of the new dorm there is a lot less campus life since they removed our sand-volley ball pit and our fire pit and they have not been replaced."
Sophomore,4,I began taking online courses at Thomas More College this year and have been very happy with the experience. I was nervous about it as I have not taken college courses in a very long time. The advisors and success coaches are amazing and very willing to help you. The instructors are also very helpful and responsive. I am very glad I chose Thomas More College and excited about finally obtaining my bachelor in business administration.
Freshman,4,"The academics at Thomas More have been great so far.  Some of the services need improvement, such as housing and the cafeteria."
College Junior,4,The school has upgraded it's entrance process since I've been there. Now you have to be a student or register with your ID to get into any part of the school.
College Junior,4,"They have a lot of workshops on campus, and any professor/staff related to your field is willing to help, too."
College Student,4,"The curriculum at Thomas More can be and is tailored to each student and their personal needs. Despite this, there is a base set of classes each student must take that does not pertain to their major or minor. Each student at the school must take a class from each other larger majors (math, social sciences, fine arts, English, foreign language, etc) and pass each in order to graduate. While it can help some students really decide what they want to do as a major, and make for a well-rounded student, it can also take up schedule space that would have otherwise been used for a student's major or minor courses. Many classes are available online and in person as well. The instructors and professors are on average, very knowledgeable in their field and teach well. The curriculum is heavily weighed upon writing skill and ability, no matter your major.  As a first-year freshman, you are put in a ""Freshman Seminar Class"" with the subject of your choosing, In these seminar classes, you are supposed to learn the basics of writing and researching for a paper along with the theme of the seminar you chose. However, some seminars fail to teach or completely ignore teaching the skill of researching for a paper which hinders the students in later courses with heavy writing assignments.  Thankfully though, there are many resources to get help from, including the writing center, student life center, and the library. There are many places students can go to comfortable study such as the hallway known as ""couchland"" where there is a collection of couches and chairs, as well as the three-story library with outside balconies, the student lounge with tables, tvs and game consoles, and the student life center. There are also several study rooms and spots within each of the 4 dorm buildings."
College Student,4,"The campus itself is a ""Tobacco Free Campus"" and there are reminders everywhere that you will be charged and have consequences if you are caught smoking. I have personally only heard of one instance where a student brought hard drugs to campus (crack cocaine) and he was immediately dealt with the first week of school. Other than that, it's oddly a pretty drug-free school save for the occasional whiff of marijuana from some students.

Alcohol is prohibited from the dorms and campus. Dorm safety checks are done periodically to check for any substances as well. Campus events typically just have pop, water, and other non-alcoholic drinks. However, art gallery openings often have wine and beer which are offered to anyone around at the time of the event, sometimes unmonitored,  and are easily assessable to underage students. 

There is virtually no peer pressure to do drugs or drink, and students are generally respectful of those who are underage and/or simply just chose not to drink."
College Student,4,"All classes take place in two buildings connected by a skyway/catwalk. Each major has its own department and floor or section of the building and all classes pertaining to that major take place there. Being a liberal arts school there is a general collection of classes each student must take, no matter their major. This can help and hurt because, while it gets the student experience and exposure to other worlds besides the one of their intended major and/or minor, it can also prolong the education experience (and raise your debt) by clogging up your schedual each semester and taking up time you could use for classes in your major or minor. Many teachers advise taking some of these required classes over the summer, but each summer course is $999 or more, and not covered by financial aid. So it's a matter of deciding if it costs more to have summer classes, or to take the classes during the fall and spring semesters and spend perhaps an extra semester or two if needed. There is a wide variety of classes offered, but many of the special topics classes are only offered every 3 or 4 years sometimes, or only taught if enough students are interested in the course. There is a good selection of online courses, however, during the fall/spring semesters and during the summer. The administrative and student life staff seem to all genuinely care about the students and there's a lot of resources to go to for help (such as the writing center and math lab). There is a lack of diversity in the staff, however, all are nice, respectful, and seem to care about their students. Also, all books and class materials are included in tuition, which means you just pick up everything the first week of school near the library."
College Student,4,"This is a small school and most everyone knows everyone else. It's generally safe and there is always little to no loitering that goes on around campus. All academic and student buidlings are typically open as well as the campus chapel, if shelter is needed. 

However, there are negatives. Sometimes the main acadmic/adminastrative building has locked doors for no speicifc reason, and there has been a number of staff members who have been charged, fired, and/or arrested due to sex-related crmes or charges over the decades. Most notibly (and ironically), is the campus safty director who was fired and arrested on suspension of child pornography. However, this was an off-campus situation and there weren't any reports of him attacking anyone on campus or anything. The entire student body recives constant emails to any type of potential threat (including weather), which I have found helpful and comforting."
College Student,4,"The school in general has a very nice atmosphere. It is pleasent and peaceful and as a short, small female, I feel safe when walking around at night after nigth class. This is a great school for those who are either less independant or those who like a small and tightknit community. The finacial aid, administrative, and student life offices are very helpful and 80-90% of the staff in those departments honestly care about your education and life while at the school. I cannot speak much on all teachers and instructors in every education department, but I can say that all of the art department instructors are very well knowlegable and genuinely want their students to succeed. The student life over all is typically welcoming and there is a good number of clubs and groups that anyone can join in, no matter their major or minor. Students are generally nice and friendly, just as staff tend to be. However, sports tend to take a prioirty in both student life and adcademic life and, if you are someone who is not into sports, it can become annoying to constantly get emails and see promotional posters and newsletters about every game and team."
College Student,4,Everyone works really hard on their school work.
College Student,4,"Our teams are fantastic, and a lot of people go."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is fair and open
College Sophomore,4,There are few accounts of alcohol or drug use
College Sophomore,4,"Professors care, just tough subjects"
College Sophomore,4,High chances for internships and jobs
College Freshman,4,Campus safety is very active and protects the students very well.
College Freshman,4,Thomas More College has a great football team and basketball team.  The community enjoys tailgating for football games and eating free wings when the girls basketball team wins.
College Freshman,4,Thomas More College is a great school to get an education.  I enjoyed being involved in the marching band program because its financial benefit and it provided a sense of belonging.  The food tends to get repetitive but you can always drive to the crest view hills mall if you want something different.
College Sophomore,4,I never hear reports of any violence
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of opportunities
College Student,4,Got what I neede with a few meetings and calls
College Sophomore,4,I really have enjoyed my time at Thomas More College. The school is very close knit but not to small so you still have the great college feel. The professors really do taking their time to make sure the students can excel to the best of their abilities and over all reach for all the goals they want to obtain. They have small class sizes allowing the students to get that one-on-one interaction from the teacher.
College Sophomore,4,I received a great scholarship for my hard work in high school
College Sophomore,4,Most students are involved with sports but not a lot of people come to see the sporting events
College Sophomore,4,I love the science building at our school and the library is wonderful.  There are many places to have privacy to study but can also have conversations.
College Sophomore,4,I am only a freshman but from what I've heard a degree from my school means something because of the level of difficulty of our classes.
College Sophomore,4,"I like the area, it is very safe and friendly.  There is an outdoor shopping mall right next door that has plenty of restaurants too."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall it's a good school, and I met a lot of great people"
College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are small
College Sophomore,4,The school is located in a good spot
College Junior,4,"It seems that everyone that lives on campus plays some sort of sport, and the sports teams are very well. "
College Junior,4,"All of the classes are in one building, which is nice when it is nasty outside. "
College Junior,4,"There are days where nothing they serve seems very good, but the buffet style is very nice."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is close by and things are quiet but often times things get a little crazy in the smaller dorms. 
College Freshman,4,All professors are extremely adept to making things challenging but worth knowing the knowledge. They hold you to extremely high standards and never realize that not everyone took AP classes in high school. If looking for a quality education you found it. Just have to work very hard to keep up with it. 
College Freshman,4,"Although it is only at certain times, there are two options to eating on campus. Meal plan covers both dining areas. "
College Freshman,4,"I have gotten involved in a lot of things such as theatre, clubs such as biology. Everyone is close by except those who commute. "
College Freshman,4,"The library, theatre, academic building, and cafeteria (commons) is wonderful. The student center is okay because of the fact that it is only a computer lab, the bookstore, and the interlude. Boys dorm has the advantage of having the study lounge which is open all night. Girls dorm does not have any amenities. Then there is the gym which the workout room available does have nothing except for a few weighted balls and 4 or 5 broken machines, completely rusted through. The see this as okay because we do have access to the country cub next store. "
College Freshman,4,"There are many places to go, to hang out, to eat. Plus anything off campus, excluding walmart or kroger, are within walking distances. "
College Freshman,4,"Everything if not followed has consequences. Parking is not one of the biggest things to worry about unless it is game day or move-in day. Drugs, alcohol, and internet have strict rules and if violated and caught have extreme consequences. "
College Sophomore,4,There is always a computer lab somewhere on campus available to use. ALWAYS.
College Sophomore,4,The area is very clean and nicely built and arranged. The school is 2 min. away from a town centre.
College Sophomore,4,"We get a pretty good deal on our meals considering they are always buffets, so you can eat as much as you want for the same price. We even have the option to get to-go boxes and we can fill them up as much as we please."
College Sophomore,4,I feel extremely safe and comfortable here on campus. Both in the parking lot and in the classroom. I feel comfortable about leaving my stuff unattended and not worry about the possibility of my things being stolen or abused.
College Senior,4,"For a small campus we have a pretty good range of choices, and many are the same as large colleges."
College Senior,4,"The campus is located near to large shopping centers, so the selection is large, it is pretty good, and price ranges vary."
College Junior,4,"Thomas More is a small college, and so the drug and alcohol scene are not big at all. If there is a drug scene at all, then I'm not aware of it."
College Sophomore,4,The computer labs are high trafficked areas during the normal college week. However in all areas you can always find a computer because lots of people just print a paper or two then leave. Campus WiFi is always excellent except for when it crashes due to illegal routers being set up this happens once or twice a year. The WiFi is easy to use and no password and constant login are required. If you need computer help the help center will always be able to do something for you even if it is just to tell you where to get a new computer part.
College Sophomore,4,The process of getting into the nursing program is very simple. Once I transferred it was very easy to get into. They set up my classes for me and told me how my next three years there would play out. They make sure you can get on track and be in the same classes as everyone else. This program in my opinion does not have an abnormal application process. I do not have any tips for admission.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone comes in with some sort of scholarship. you can get one from coming from a public school.
College Sophomore,4,"Well it is in Northern Kentucky. We have all four seasons so it will be hot in the summer, rainy in the spring, chilly and windy in the fall and cold and snowy in the winter."
College Senior,4,People from many different backgrounds and walks of life
College Senior,4,"There are many places on campus available for students to study. The library offers three floors for students to study on, equipped with computers. The studnet center has computers as well that are available any time. The student center also has a cafe which allows students to converse by the pool table, or grab a snack or a meal together. A game room composed of a hockey table, ping pong table, wii, play station, and couches offers a place for students to relax while enjoying their friend's company."
College Senior,4,"One thing that attracted me to this school was how personable the staff was at Thomas More College when I visited. The informed me that while the classes are small, the teachers are able to give individual attention and know you by name. Students are encouraged to contact teachers if they need more help in a class. If a student misses a class more than a couple of times, the student is notified by the teacher. You are not a number here at Thomas More College, but a name known by many."
College Sophomore,4,The faculty make this school stand out. They are all willing to help so long as you reach out and ask for it. Even then if some professors see you struggling they offer you advice. This community is very close knit and happy to help
College Junior,2,There wasn't a big support system for the sports teams there.
College Student,2,No one does anything. You go to class then home.
College Student,2,There is only one sorority and fraternity.
College Freshman,2,could be easier and less complex
College Sophomore,2,There are not many places nearby to party but downtown is close
College Junior,2,The school does not help look for other types of housing. 
College Junior,2,Its a small school and its not strictly white but it is predominately white.
College Sophomore,2,Don't need any. its small so you can walk everyhwere
College Sophomore,2,"I see things around the campus that are dedicated and sponsored by the sororities and fraternities but they are not a big deal around campus and not many people belong to these groups, as far as I know. Overall, not much is known about the groups but they do some things around campus."
Freshman,1,"The academics are good but if you’re looking to have fun in college, DO NOT COME HERE. I sit in my dorms on the weekends bored out of my mind while I see all my other high school friends having a blast in college. I’m transferring because of how terrible this school is"
College Sophomore,1,"I don't really know much about it, other than it's expensive "
College Junior,1,"The financial aid people at my college give hardly any options in receiving aid. They expect everyone to be able to get outside loans, and if you don't have anyone to co-sign they don't help at all."
College Junior,1,"If you need to get somewhere you better have a car. or else you could stick to walking to your nearest town center. Public transportation is always available, but first you would have to learn the bus route if you're not originally from the area."
College Sophomore,1,There is no night life other than late night study sessions and the occasional dorm room drinking party
College Senior,1,"Only had enough student loans to fit the core curriculum, it was had to impossible to come up with the extra money needed to complete the degree on time."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus can be a nightmare. Be sure to get to campus at least 30 minutes before your class to ensure you'll get a space and make it to class on time. Most of the good spots are for faculty only. The students have to park almost to the road and walk about a mile to get to class.
Recent Alumnus,1,There are not many scholarships to receive other than academic scholarships.

Alum,5,Great online classes and caring faculty. Staff was always available to help. Baker has been doing online since the 1993.
Alum,5,Love Baker! Caring faculty and staff. I landed a job within weeks of graduating. I felt fully prepared to start my new job day one.
Freshman,5,Baker College helped me finalize what I wanted to do as far as a career. Advisors are very helpful and the teachers put forth their best effort and they don't give up on their students! Each of them working diligently to make sure everyone in class understands material and that they're gaining new knowledge.
Niche User,5,It was a really good experience. I took online colleges throughout highschool through baker. The classes are nicely set up and it is very nicely set up online that it is not hard to log in and get to your classes at all. I learned alot from them taking classes here.  I have been on campus and it very nice and the people there are really nice.
Graduate Student,5,I love Baker! The teachers are excellent and really want you to succeed. The small classes help to have more one on one relationship with the professor. I would recommend Baker!
Junior,5,I like how easy it is to take online classes. I think online advisors and financial aid help need to be better.
Freshman,5,Enrollment and registration is quick and easy at Baker College. The student portal is very nice and easy to find everything you need. Tuition is cheap for an online Bachelor's degree. The advisers are helpful and always get back to you as quick as possible.
Junior,5,I have had nothing but a great experience at Baker. The staff and faculty really care about your experience and what you learn when you're at Baker. Every class that I have had has been really informative and really engaged the many different learning styles I had. From very expensive hands on labs and in depth lectures. This is the perfect school for you if you love learning and making connections with your professors.
Freshman,5,The Academic Advisors are very knowledgeable and caring for students. They are quick to respond to request and are more than willing to help. My advisor goes above and beyond for me and looks out for me with great advice and tips for school.
Sophomore,5,"I really love Baker College, because they are not just like every other College; they care about every student and want them to succeed and become successful. I am glad I chose this to be my College and thankful they are so great at helping me in accomplishing my degree. You become family and they don't give you everything handed to you, so you do have to put in effort; however they are like your parents who love you and want you to succeed."
College Sophomore,5,So far i have not encountered a job internship.
College Junior,5,On-line allows students to still have interaction with their classmate but on a schedule that suits them.
College Junior,5,The college sets up job interviews for graduates and they can come back time after time. The college will always set their former students up with a job in their profession.
College Junior,5,The professors care about their students and are willing to go the extra mile to help their students succeed.
College Senior,5,"The school is preparing me for HR Management and to be able to deal with employees, decision making, problem solving, employee related laws, ethics, and being a leader in business operations"
College Senior,5,Baker College Online was the best thing for me educationally and personally. I needed convenience in being home with family and also to continue my education that would prepare me for the real world.
College Junior,5,I love the small class sizes and all of my teachers are professional very knowledgeable.
College Freshman,5,"I have had the pleasure of having quite a few great professors, one or two bad seeds tend to be less informative and explaining details, but the rest were great"
College Freshman,5,All teachers instruct from experience within the field. I really enjoy learning from experienced individuals.
College Senior,5,Baker College offered me a better opportunity to advance my education
College Junior,5,"Every semester so far, I have had to change the days that I can take classes in order to better fit my work schedule. This has not yet been an issue and the advisor has been very helpful and knowledgeable every time."
College Junior,5,I love this school and the direction that my life will be going in once i graduate. This school is getting me ready for a future career in the real world.
College Junior,5,"This school has job fairs, and meetings, and student body events all the time. Talking to an advisor is as easy as walking into their office. Couldn't be any happier with how easy it is to get involved with anything at this campus."
College Junior,5,"The classes are really affordable. I have some difficulty affording it, but with financial aid it is doable."
College Junior,5,I believe there is around a ninety percent employment rate after graduation from baker. It is one of the best schools for getting jobs after graduation.
College Sophomore,5,The work connects to real life experience and is cohesive.
College Sophomore,5,They offer highly sought after programs.
College Sophomore,5,Very friendly and inviting.  You know you'll receive support necessary for a an optimal college experience.
College Junior,5,I love my program because the class variety is so interesting!  The work load is specific to the class and is heavy but that is to be expected in a 6 week program.
College Junior,5,There are many different degrees offered at this school.  I also believe there are more degrees offered here than at other online schools.
College Junior,5,The workload is heavy but in a good way.  My classes are accelerated so I have to stay on top of them.  It helps to have this type of class because I retain the information better than a 15 week class.  I love the peer to peer interaction in the discussion posts.  I have had some of my own thought patterns changed by engaging in these classes.
College Junior,5,I love the diversity!  I have learn many new things from these classes concerning different cultures.
College Junior,5,I had the easiest time getting my credits to transfer
College Junior,5,I love this school and would love to continue to attend but my financial aid is running out. The school has been wonderful in trying to help me.
College Junior,5,It was refreshing to have the costs be lower than other schools out there.  This is not a for-profit school. They seriously care about the education process.
College Junior,5,The online facilites are some of the best I have ever seen!
College Junior,5,uploading documents and class discussions are easy to accomplish
College Junior,5,I attend the online school and the system is so easy to learn!
College Sophomore,5,Most of the professors are great
College Sophomore,5,Very specific curriculum. I like it.
College Sophomore,5,Love the quarter system. Fast track but hard work
College Sophomore,5,Everything is very easy to do.
College Sophomore,5,Students are serious about their studies
College Sophomore,5,Best online courses I've ever taken.
College Junior,5,They are very helpful and made me feel great about my choice of school.
College Junior,5,"My online school offers a great platform, but the campus locations do offer students a lot. Baker is not a full university, so they do not offer some things. I found that if you are looking to advance yourself for a low-cost and very good quality education, then Baker is for you."
College Junior,5,Everyone seems to be very nice and are very keen on doing a great job in the classroom. I have never had a problem with any students or faculty and would recommend Baker to anyone that is looking for a better life for themselves or their family.
College Sophomore,5,"I truly am grateful that I switched to Baker College.  My previous college experience of 4-5 years was not helpful to my life and I left with a degree that I wasn't after and was unable to acquire the degree I sought in the first place.  There are many colleges to attend and we all hear good and bad of each, but I have not had a bad experience here at all after 4 semesters."
College Sophomore,5,"The prerequisites for the Nursing Program prepare you for whats to come.  For example, the Anatomy & Physiology class is hard but you learn so much that it carries over into other classes.  Microbiology prepares you for other classes, as well.  Its not just that its a ton of information that you need to know, its that the instructors teach it in a way that you will retain it and use it and, when the time comes, retrieve it from your memory.  I found this to be true in many of my classes.  The community college I had previously attended was not as effective in doing this."
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone who is in college is seeking to better their own lives in some way and by doing so they are looking forward to being a part of changing the world even if it is in a small way.  The inspiration of someone or something has led a person to become a student and Baker College makes one feel that their aspirations are meant to be pursued.  Being a student here makes me feel like my dreams are attainable and further down the road I will be able to help others.  The campus life would be described as friendly and career oriented, which is sometimes hard to find living in this area."
College Sophomore,5,Finding and signing up for classes is a very easy process.  The admissions office staff is very helpful in answering questions or concerns.  They help with the initial process and are available at any time with further questions.  The wait for selecting classes and buying books from the bookstore has been very organized and processed quickly.  I have been here for 4 semesters now with no problems.  I work and go to college and have been able to maintain both without severely high stress factors.
College Sophomore,5,I have attended Baker College for 4 semesters now and the instructors and classmates are all very friendly.  Students there seem to be very professional and are eager to complete their programs.
College Sophomore,5,"I attended a community college and was on a 4 year waiting list for the Nursing Program.  The second semester in the program (after the 4 year wait) I had an instructor who was not very cooperative.  One year later I attended Baker College, which I am in now and find the class material and instructors to be very helpful and highly educated.  I would recommend Baker College to anyone looking to pursue a degree no matter what their age is."
College Freshman,5,No back and forth traveling.
College Student,5,Online classes give me a great deal of flexibility. I love it i don't have to drive anywhere or be anywhere at a specific time. If i want to log on at 2am or 2pm it doesn't matter as long as I do what is required of me.
College Student,5,Awesome online programs. Accelerated pace online will help get your degree faster. Very easy transfer of credits.
College Student,5,"Baker has an alumni career center and forums for open jobs, they also have career assistance for life ,which is great."
College Student,5,"I love have fast paced it is, you never get bored and everyone is always so helpful."
College Student,5,"they give you a step plan of what is needed based on your degree. It's essentially a degree plan and it helps you keep focused on what classes you have taken and what you still need to take, it's pretty awesome."
College Student,5,"Since I take classes online i have a pretty heavy workload, each term is 6 weeks so we go pretty fast which i love. everyone is so helpful and there are tons of oppourtunity for help."
Senior,4,"Mostly great instructors. Little-to-no food choices and rather few student activities on-campus. If you are looking for a school to attend and wish to primarily focus on your degree then Baker College might be the right choice. If you are looking for a school with a lively college atmosphere then Baker College probably is not the right choice, particularly if you are looking for a “party school”. The instructors have been excellent, professional, and helpful, and are very knowledgeable about their subject areas and willing to work with students to help them succeed. The college’s focus on employable degrees means that more content covers realistic situations, rather than theoretical, and as such goes a long way to preparing students for future careers."
Junior,4,I have enjoyed my education at Baker College this has been I am truly grateful I chose Baker College for my education my academics have been hard but it has been every thing I have chosen to work hard for.
Senior,4,"I used to like the shorter classes that were 10 weeks not they are 16 and less get done toward my future goals of completing my degree.  Also the conversion took away credit hours, yet I didn`t get a refund for the credits that have been adjusted. I paid for those credit hours and now I have no money available to loan."
Junior,4,"Baker College has been a good experience. The classes are small so learning is easier and the teachers are knowledgeable and really want their students to learn. The campus is small, so friendships are easily made. Overall, a really good experience."
Junior,4,It is a great school for completing an online bachelors degree. Easy to register for classes and access to the online system is always running smoothly. Books can be a little expensive but that is due to being tailored to bakers specific classes.
Freshman,4,I've been attending Baker College as a dual enrolled student and it's been a great experience. All the students and professors are down to earth too which makes it comfortable to ask questions if you need to.
Freshman,4,"I am currently enrolled at Baker College of Flint and am studying Sign Language Interpreting. So far, I have had an overall good experience with my teachers, other students, and the staff at the college.
The support for students is there, but they are a little vague as to what each step is when initially enrolling for classes. I graduated 25 years ago so when I first enrolled, it seemed as if they assumed I knew all the steps required as far as applying for financial aid, how disbursements worked, etc.
They also don't explain where you go for specific questions. They just say contact student services, even if you actually need to call financial aid.
They are friendly and the college is very nice as far as amenities go. They have thought of little things such as plugs for your phones and laptops inside the oversized chairs you can sit in. I thought that was thoughtful and insightful.
Overall, I enjoy attending Baker College."
Niche User,4,Baker college of flint is a nice campus and I go to its sister campus in Cass City.  Cass city is smaller and more my style as I like the country life better than city life.
Recent Alumnus,4,This school has a very good outlook on careers and placement. a lifetime assistance program is in place for current students and former students.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I would choose my school because it is a small campus and the professors seem to genuinely care about your well being.  They also understand and acknowledge that there are other involvements outside of the classroom, so they are considerate."
College Senior,4,"So far, I have been very fortunate that I had good online instructors that don't overwhelm their students with lots of assignments. Everything was manageable and instructors were available very often to answer any of my questions."
College Senior,4,"The vast majority of my instructors were very knowledgeable and were able to give me a great learning environment. There were a few that didn't work out so well, but was great overall."
College Senior,4,"Besides two instructors I've had in the past, it was very good as far as my academic experience has been going."
College Sophomore,4,I like that I can work around my class schedule with my personal life. I can set my time frame and plan out my schedule.
College Sophomore,4,So far I really like the college. I do have a couple things I do not like in the mathematics department. Have one techer that makes it very hard to learn from and attend her class.
College Junior,4,I am able to get the classes on the times that I need. The school works will you so that you are still on the course to graduate.
College Junior,4,The college has great career services and if you have a question they are more than willing to help.
College Junior,4,"The school places their students into internships after graduation. The business management program gets in-depth in the way that business is run. They cover all the important aspects as in marketing, finance, and employees."
College Junior,4,Baker College of Flint is flexible to my schedule. All the employees and teachers care about your success as an individual. The professors are easy to contact and are willing to take time out of their day to help their students pass and succeed. I will and have recommended this college to friends and others that want to go to a career based college that is cares about your future.
College Sophomore,4,"It is a requirement to participate daily on the blackboard online, however with time management, the workload is manageable."
College Sophomore,4,"Baker allows for flexibility. Assignments are required on the due date or it is an automatic zero. It requires great time management skills, however the Professors are clear in their instructions and course schedule."
College Junior,4,it fits my busy schedule
College Junior,4,It has taught me a lot
College Junior,4,I don't know that there is one
College Junior,4,I want to manage others in projects
College Junior,4,I will see when I land a great job for my skills
College Junior,4,I think the books are a waste of money but the classes are great- They are challenging but fit into my work schedule.
College Sophomore,4,Some class work I have had some trouble with but my teachers helped me with it.
College Sophomore,4,Mostly everything is online but it is really easy and the teacher help explain everything that we have questions about to help us understand.
College Sophomore,4,the classes are small and they make it easier to learn. The professors are also kind and help you understand the work you are doing.
College Sophomore,4,The teachers really help you understand and try to relate it to the real world.
College Freshman,4,They help you find a job no matter how long or when you need it.
College Freshman,4,Job placement is expected and it happens.
College Junior,4,"My program is unique to Baker. The workload depends on the teacher, but it has never been overwhelming. The college helps students finds internships and has life-long job help."
College Junior,4,"Night classes make it easy to work and take classes. I have not personally transferred credits, but know that Baker does not accept a lot of transferred credits."
College Junior,4,"Very good student to teacher ratio; however, financial aid and career services are a bit of a hassle."
College Freshman,4,"I like the professors that I've had and the peer to peer interaction. Most have been quite supportive. I like that the work can be done online rather than in a classroom. I do like the interaction with peers because I don't have to speak to everyone, it helps me think more clearly rather than trying to think about what to think of next while in the classroom."
College Freshman,4,The Workload is average but the expectations are quite extensive. I haven't done the internship yet.
College Senior,4,Everything is related to the real world.
College Sophomore,4,The school's professional and the staff really helps.
College Sophomore,4,I've had nothing but positive experiences with my school. The professors are all very helpful and so are my classmates. We all work together to gain a better understanding of the material and how we can apply it to real world experiences. I wouldn't pick any other school to go to.
College Junior,4,Good student to teacher ratio. Teachers are very knowledgeable about their fields.
College Junior,4,"I absolutely love all of the classes and most of my teachers so far. The teachers I do not like as much were also very good, just not as great."
College Junior,4,The courses that you need will always be offered. I have never had an issue getting into a class that I needed and have always had all of the tools necessary to do well in the class available to be.
College Junior,4,The student body at baker is very smart and outgoing. They work very hard and group problems are never an issue.
College Junior,4,I am challenged in the ways I'd like to be challenged and able to get help when it is needed. The academics are overall very good.
College Junior,4,They have counselors and teachers in each specific major and are very geared towards helping each student graduate with a good chance of employment after graduation.
College Junior,4,"At Baker College in Flint, they have resources to do just about anything. They have everything from tutoring to resume building centers. I find it very helpful."
College Junior,4,I love the way the worker always speak to you.
College Junior,4,"I like the observation opportunities that start early on, so you get used to being in a classroom."
College Junior,4,"Admissions advisors were great, but after the admissions process it changes. It seems that you are more like a paycheck to the school instead of an actual person."
College Junior,4,Very Accessible and if you keep going into the offices they recognize you are even more helpful
College Sophomore,4,have not had any issues as of yet
College Sophomore,4,less expensive than majority of colleges compared

College Sophomore,4,all types of resources are available for students of all ages that need help or just want tutoring or a review on schoolwork
College Junior,4,The career center has given me some phenomenal ideas for jobs during grad school in my  field
Junior,2,"It was mostly alright, but i don't particularly care for driving into flint to go to school. All of the teachers are knowledgeable friendly and willing to help you learn beyond just the books. They assure you can apply what you learn and don't just have the book mesmerized."
College Freshman,2,Nobody is willing to work with you in extreme cases.
College Sophomore,2,"This is a career school, so you really can't take any extracurriculars, unless its on your student list, or if you want to waste money. Class sizes are small, anywhere from 11 to 30. Classes are 5 to 10 weeks depending on the course."
College Sophomore,2,"Tuition is a little high, but I've known higher. The financial aid office sucks and gives you the run around."
College Sophomore,2,"Class registration sucks, you can be sitting in the registration room for 5 hours and still have to wait longer."
College Junior,2,The orientation is a hassle.
College Senior,2,"For them to be ""financial advisors"" they don't advise much."
College Freshman,2,Baker doesn't offer much to online students.
College Sophomore,2,"I do mostly on line classes , I work my job all day and come home and try to complete my school work.

there are no internships as far as I know. They never have the information you need 

Always waiting for information to be transferred to another so you can move ahead"
College Sophomore,2,"Submitting assignments is always a problem, if it is an hour late it is not excepted after all the work you did to submit it.

Many times there is a problem with either the school web site or the internet connection or some other problem with compatibility issues. This is not fair at all. This should be changed"
College Junior,2,"     I tried twice to take the same class on-line (2 different instructors from different states) and had to drop both times due to the amount of workload it entailed. I was spending 2-3 hours a night answering the discussion questions posted because the instructors demanded the post to be minimum 500 words and you had to give citations to back up your opinion. This meant you had to do on-line research before you gave an opinion. Most of the questions forced you to dig deeper than the material covered in the book. It was like doing 2 mini research papers a night to fulfill your posting requirements--- that was in addition to homework for your other classes. 

     The same class was finally offered on campus and I took it. The workload was no where near what the online class demanded. There really wasn't much classroom discussion about the materials either. Everything discussed was based on the material in the book, and I learned way more than I did trying to cram material into a post. "
College Sophomore,2,"I have had poor experiences with the online courses I've taken. The curriculum was sufficient, however, the online instructors were terrible. The lack of communication and facilitation was surprising. If I can help it, I will not be enrolling in another online course."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Avoid buying your books and supplies from the school book store. Everything is over priced and it is very frustrating getting what you need on time.
I wish Baker did not depend on text books that have so much homework online that require special one time used codes. It means spending $50-100 on just the code or buying books brand new from the school. Most of the people in financial aid Don't know their left from right, but there are a few who are excellent."
College Senior,2,Good starting point but not to help my future.
College Senior,2,Not a good experience with financial aid at som campuses.  They seemed to be so hurried they don't have time to deal with me.
College Senior,2,"no sports, so it has the library, a student resource center, a career center and few dorms"
College Senior,2,"Baker is ok, the one thing i hate is that credits that do transfer, dont get full credit due to how we have 10 week classes, so a typical 4 credit class is 2 or 3 credits somewhere else. Another thing i hate is you get lied too by the advisers about dropping a class.  sure baker is there a more of a business school, plus they got online classes, and various campuses."
College Sophomore,2,"Some professors seem to truly love what they do and want their students to learn from the course. Many, unfortunately, expect to just give assignments and tests but not actually do the work of teaching the students. The students are left to learn on their own or from each other and, if a large number start to do poorly, they ""dumb down"" the tests."
College Sophomore,2,I haven't learned a lot of new information through my courses. It feels like a lot of busy work.
College Sophomore,2,"Baker College does not often offer a very flexible class schedule. It is also extremely difficult to transfer credits. Sometimes, it is a struggle to receive straight answers from faculty, such as counselors."
Niche User,1,"There was none, everything was very vague until the class started.  I was forced to drop it immediately."
Niche User,1,"I signed up to take a course from Baker to get my professional education certification.  I was not told that having a student as a case study was required.  The class was being offered in the summer after Covid-19.  This shoudl have been made clear ahead of time as a prerequisite for the course, it was never mentioned.  I was unable to access any of the documents requiring this until the course had started.  Everything was a total waste of my time."
College Sophomore,1,"If you are going in to the tech field, look forward to mostly night classes, 6-10 pm."
College Sophomore,1,"I would not choose this school if I had the chance to redo it. I wanted a school with character and fun, with good learning. I should have went to a different school after my first year, before I wasted money."
College Sophomore,1,The career services are not where they should be. Be wary of coming here. Its depressing.
College Sophomore,1,"Online classes require you to get on at least 5 days of the week, twice a day. seems like a waste of time to me."
College Sophomore,1,"The library is okay, I've been intimidated walking in every time. It just feels unwelcoming and confusing. There are hardly any campus activities for the dorm students. If you are looking for fun and activities around campus do not go here, don't make my mistake. There are no places to do anything around or near the campus either. There is a gym for working out, but it is small and can be overcrowded at times, so it is hard to get a good work out. The financial aid and other faculty dealing with you and your living, finances, etc. are pretty clueless. They can never give you a solid answer on anything. You don't know what scholarships or financial aid you have until a week before classes start. You also don't get a proper estimate on housing. They were off by over 500 dollars and many people had to drop out. You don't get your rooming assignments until a week before the year starts either. If I were you, stay far from this campus. They made it out to be all sunshine and rainbows, and it is far from it. If none of this sways you, I'll let you know that their credits only transfer to other baker colleges, and very few other colleges."
College Freshman,1,"I like the ease of being able to study when I can. I'm a single mom and work full time, so online classes are the only way I can attend college."
College Sophomore,1,"Like I mentioned before I need the extra help, but they won't let me have it because of my GPA being a little too low."
College Senior,1,last graduating class none still have jobs
College Sophomore,1,Outdated set up. Professors assign work and offer little help. Students are left to learn either on their own or from each other. Almost daily online posting is required and takes a considerable amount of time.
College Sophomore,1,Baker's tutuion is reasonable but there is not enough finanical aid for older people like me who have no choice to go back to school and have no money to pay for it. Something else needs to be done about this.
College Senior,1,I can't graduate because they can't find an externship for me.  So here I sit in limbo.  Maybe I will update if I can find a way to meet this requirement.  I can't imagine the post-grad service being much better than the current service.
College Senior,1,No Resources – The ones that they do have via phone are never available.  You leave a message and it promptly gets sucked into a black hole.  No one ever calls you back.
College Senior,1,"Diverse in Age – The age at Baker is anywhere from 17- 100.  I actually had a 73 year old in a Math class of mine.  Most are poorly educated and Baker does not raise the bar and make their students work on their grammar or critical thinking.  Instead, they simply lower the bar leaving Baker grads walking out with an ""A"" on their paper but basically unemployable for higher level positions because they cannot compete with other graduates.  I am in 400 level classes right now and most posts by students are so poorly written I cannot understand the point they are trying to make.  The teacher doesn't correct or make the students clarify."
College Senior,1,"There is no athletics, think of the student center as being about the size of your high school's education counselor's office.  Library is small, no campus activities."
College Senior,1,"Nothing to See Here – The library is also very small and has little useful information for any computer field. Campus activities are nonexistent. There is very, very little to see and do at BC Flint"

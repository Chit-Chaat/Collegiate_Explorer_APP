Sophomore,5,I had a tremendous experience with online education through Kent State Tuscarawas. At first it was a bit of a challenge being consistent with doing my work online because you have such more time. The professors handled everything great and helped out as much as they could which was very helpful with the difficult circumstances we were facing in the world.
Sophomore,5,"One thing that sticks out to me about Kent State Tuscarawas is how the feel is. Everyone at the campus is very welcoming and just makes you feel like you belong. There is also a sense of high school feel which for me can be a good thing but for others, that would be a reason for change. Overall I love campus"
Junior,5,The staff has been amazing. They have been with me through every step from signing up to starting class.

Niche User,5,I was a CCP student here. It really helped me learn what college was like and how to get ready for the big change. It was. a nice campus and I would recommend it to anyone. The only problem is how their isn't really a uniform student body people are not very involved because it is a commuter campus and there are no dorms. I believe this will change when they get dorms which they are currently in the process of building.
Freshman,5,"Kent State Tuscarawas is a very interactive and excellent college. The smaller size is nice because it means there is more personalized relationships with professors and staff, creating the best learning experience possible.

College Sophomore,5,"Professors seem to enjoy what they are doing, and have a passion for teaching."
College Junior,5,Easy to get with counselors to help decide what classes are the best for you. Courses are easy to add and drop. Everything is fitted for how you'd like it.
College Junior,5,Always great opportunities to use the knowledge that you have gathered from the professors. They know what they're talking about and when they don't they aren't afraid to admit that they need to look it up
College Junior,5,There are a wide variety of courses available which is awesome. Students can join clubs to see what they are interested in and meet friends that share common interests.

Sophomore,4,It is a very welcoming place at Kent State Tuscarawas. All the professors that I had so far cared about all the students and would get to know them. All the students there are so nice and help one another on anything that they need done.
Junior,4,"Kent State University at Tuscarawas is a fine school to go especially for someone who wantsâ€™ an education. It's filled with teachers who are willing to help, and you learn and work with you when you find things difficult. While they have yet to implement dorms on campus, I know that there are plans to do just that. The Performing Arts Center or PAC as it generally called is a great place for those looking to find some entertainment as well as hold certain events. Overall Kent State University at Tuscarawas is a great place for anyone starting there college journey and getting their foot in the door with higher learning."
Freshman,4,"I liked the small campus so it didn't take me very long to find a parking spot or walk to class. I also liked it because my classes were small so I could connect with my professor and classmates, my opinions were heard during class and all of my questions were answered. They tried to engage in students on many occasions and more often than not they provided free food!"
Freshman,4,"I have only attended the local university for a short period of time, but in the time that i have spent here it has been pleasant. The staff is more than welcome to help, as well as the students. The facilities are kept well, and many resources are offered on campus."
Freshman,4,It's a great school.  There's a good amount of students - enough to make it enjoyable but not so many that you're constantly distracted.  Everyone is very nice and most of the professors try their hardest to keep you going in the right direction.
Niche User,4,"I enjoy attending this school as it has many opportunities offered; including on campus study sessions, clubs and a wonderful library. It's easy to get into contact with your professors and advisors. The faculty are always willing to help."
Alum,4,"Kent State Tuscarawas campus offers you a very low tuition rate for the price of 1. With the low tuition rate, the professors are very hands on with the minimal number of students in each class compared to Kent State main campus. They have a cafeteria open almost all day and outside activities in both fall and spring semesters. I earned my bachelors in Psychology at Kent State Tuscarawas and saved so much money compared to those who attend a 4 year public institution!"
Sophomore,4,"Kent State at Tuscarawas is a close-knit school able to provide academic support for each individual student. The range of available classes is excellent and many students are able to complete their general or lower-level classes here for a branch school price before transferring to the main campus. Some majors can even complete bachelor's degrees entirely at the Tuscarawas branch, as I plan to do with my nursing degree. The professors are cordial and understanding of the pressures balancing family, work, and school work and enjoy helping students reach their fullest potential. However, the cafeteria menu is quite small and overpriced. I survive by packing lunches. Everything else about Kent State at Tuscarawas is wonderful."
Niche User,4,"I really liked how there was always a fundraiser going on that one of the clubs had set up. There would be things like pancake breakfasts and homemade Christmas cookies. There are definitely a lot of clubs compared to other Kent State branches, in my opinion. The Tuscarawas branch is the only Kent State branch left that has a gym other than the main campus. Also, they are constantly trying to introduce a new activity or replace one. For example, a sport. After I left there, they started a soccer team. Something I would like to see them change or fix is their wifi network; it seemed like there was always issues with it. Another thing I would like to see them change or fix is their parking area. Either make it bigger or rearrange it."
College Sophomore,4,"Schedule was very flexible, and it helped me a lot."
College Sophomore,4,"Online courses are not my favorite, but they work well for some of my class mates."
College Sophomore,4,"There are good opportunities, which I will definitely be looking for."

College Sophomore,4,"Great professors, with a lot of experience in the field!"
College Sophomore,4,My experience was great because it is a small University and everyone is helpful.
College Senior,4,I have not had any major trouble with this at my school. The only thing that has been a pain was the fact that two of my course times changed after the course started. This meant a late start and scheduling conflicts. All of my credits transferred with ease. Due to the small size of the campus there are not many evening courses and no weekend courses.
College Senior,4,I have not done a lot of extensive research on the post-grad services at this school but some of the graduate students I have talked to say they are very good.
College Senior,4,"Courses vary from professor to professor. I have had an Organic Chemistry class that was a breeze and I didn't have to study at all to get an A. I also had an introductory Biology course that I had to really work at in order to get an A. They were both very good courses though. I have not taken any online courses, only classes on campus. For the majority they are relatively small classes, lots of one on one time with the professors, and not a ton of work. I have also found that at this campus of Kent State there are not a large variety of courses. Mostly the basic gen eds and a few specific programs."
College Senior,4,"I am a part of the vet tech program at Kent Tusc. I will be going into my second year of a two year program. This program has a lot of hands on experience with animals and we are learning things that will be essential in the clinic. This program has a lot of bookwork associated with it as well. A lot of memorization of drugs, techniques, diseases, etc. Overall I really enjoy the program."
College Senior,4,"I really enjoy Kent Tusc as a college. The small size makes for small classes and lots of one on one time with the professor. All of the professors that I've had so far have been really easy to work with and understanding. They really want you to learn the material. There are lots of clubs available to the students and the honors program is great. As an honors student I have access to more scholarships and extra learning experiences. Technically it is more work, but its a different kind of work that is very enjoyable. I love my honors assignments."
College Junior,4,Very flexible. But of course classes are limited so they may not be exactly what you are looking for but are better than nothing
College Junior,4,The alumni are still part of the school in many ways. It's a small school so once you are able to graduate you tend to bale attached to the charm
College Junior,4,There are plenty of opportunities to get internships around the school. Professors often recommend where to go and how they glean get a job and or internship. There is also a separate building for students who are looking to start their own business and the school gives them free office space to do that.
College Junior,4,"There are clubs that are specific to your major, great activities, and amazing library cat and so much more!"
College Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed Kent State Tuscarawas. The majority of my professors have been really great. I like the size of the campus. It's less intimidating than larger colleges and I like the small town feel of the campus. It's very convenient to have the opportunity to expand my education so close to home. The tuition costs are so low compared to my friends attending colleges such as OU, OSU, Malone, Wooster, and Miami. I'm glad to receive such a great education for such a low cost that is so close to home."
College Sophomore,4,"Very small and easy to commute to everywhere, easy to meet people."
College Junior,4,"I haven't personally used a lot of the resourses.  I've used the library and computer labs, and those were great. They were staffed well, quiet, and easy to use."
College Junior,4,"The professors are resourcefull and qualified for these courses.  I learn a lot from them, not just from the textbook material, but from their real life experiences, which I believe is more important that the text anyways."
College Junior,4,Kent State is known as a great school in our area and valued by local employers.
College Junior,4,They work their best to make sure you get your degree as quickly and efficiently as possible.
College Junior,4,This college has a lot of relaxing places to study and work on school projects.
College Junior,4,I love that this college is small because it is easy to make friends becaus everyone is friendly and helpful.
College Junior,4,I haven't had any problems with the administration.
College Junior,4,Kent has always been flexible with me.
College Junior,4,I like the locality and the setting of the school in general. I grew up in this area and so I don't think I would like the huge college campus feel.
College Sophomore,4,The great part about going to a local school is the local job opportunities and the networking that is opened up through going local.
College Sophomore,4,"The wireless access on campus is great. It supports not only computers, but mobile devices as well. "
College Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed the gym and weight lifting/ training rooms while I have been at KSU at Tusc. They offer many different ways to train and the gym staff is always willing to help you. Working out between classes was a great stress reliever for myself and other students.
College Sophomore,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at KSU at Tusc, there is always something going on, an activity, student organization or other group doing something. There is a wide variety of students- from post-secondary high school students to adult 'non traditional' students."
College Sophomore,4,"For the size of the campus, Kent State at Tuscarawas offers a wide variety of majors. I have been very pleased with my experience so far."
Niche User,2,"Very small, local town school. Basically half the people who go here are high schoolers in the CCP program. I've had decent professors and the workload is barely anything."
College Sophomore,2,The online courses that are given are few and far between and most of the time the classes that are offered online are not core classes. They systems of online work need reviewed. Peer-to-peer interaction is not something that I've dealt with in an online class. The work load was okay.

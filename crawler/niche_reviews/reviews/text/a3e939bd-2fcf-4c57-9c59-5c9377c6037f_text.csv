Sophomore,5,I love Elon! Having small classes makes you feel like an important part of the community. Professors actually care about their student's success.
Alum,5,"Elon's agility is impressive - as the pandemic continues to challenge institutions of higher education, Elon's agility and creative thinking keeps them propelling forward successfully as they deliver both online and in-person options for students."
Alum,5,Elon is distinct and amazing. The engaging and supportive community of faculty and staff merge together seamlessly to provide a terrific college experience for all students. A beautiful campus with close proximity to major metro areas in NC also provides a myriad of experiential learning opportunities for students. My Elon experience was wonderful.
Junior,5,"Elon professors CARE about their students and it really showed during the transition. Online learning is typically conducted via Webex and professors were still available during their office hours over the same platform. The transition into virtual learning was executed smoothly, considering the circumstances. I actually performed better via the online learning model."
Junior,5,"The professors at Elon are some of the most inspiring people and really do care about their students. The campus is just the right size and the extension of the town of Elon just outside the campus' borders puts Elon University in a very convenient. There are so many different opportunities for students to engage in an array of student club, service opportunities, and cultural events that Elon students are never found board or with nothing to do. Elon's a really, really great school."
Sophomore,5,"Elon University cares about it students and helps to create unique relationships between students and staff. It provides great educational experiences to help students get a jump start towards their dream careers. I really love my time at Elon, and I've made some great connections."
Junior,5,Elon has done an excellent job with online learning despite the recent change in our economic and health distress. The university has made the most of online learning and the professors are dedicated to the success of each student.
Alum,5,"I remember coming on Niche before entering college attempting to sort through reviews in order to determine which university would be the best fit for me. Now, as a recent graduate of Elon, I am 100% confident in saying I made the right decision four years ago. Although everyones experience is different, my time spent at Elon was integral to my academic, professional, and personal growth. I made all of my best friends at Elon, was inspired my fellow students daily, and received a quality education from professors who truly cared about me. Throughout my time at Elon I was able to live on campus all four years, study abroad, have an on campus job, complete research, and have an active social life-and this is the norm for many students! The community present on campus is truly special, and I know I will forever have a home there."
Alum,5,"Online learning, while challenging for everyone, was a smooth transition at Elon. The administration did a lot of work to check in on students and make sure they were adjusting, and the professors worked hard to set up their classes in a new way. All of my professors worked really hard at making sure I was learning and understanding the material, and went above and beyond in helping me."
Sophomore,5,"I have had an amazing experience thus far at Elon, being able to work towards a degree while making friends, playing on a sports team here, and juggling extracurriculars. I feel as though they really care about their students and have been working hard, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic to make sure their students are accomodated and taken care of to keep up with their learning from remote locations. I also feel as if they make campus life very peaceful and look  to fulfill all the needs of all their students. Beyone this, I think the university goes above and beyond to provide opportunities and experiences for all of their different students."
Freshman,5,Elon is a beautiful campus. Makes me feel safe to walk around. The residence halls are up to date and home feeling. The professors take time with students and want them to succeed in life. The dining halls are just great. On our visit I was so impressed by all the dining halls were so clean and made me feel at home to relax and eat a meal. Elon has students all over the US and even internationally. I'm so excited to continue my education with Elon University.
Freshman,5,"Elon is an amazing university. The transition to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively seamless, and we were refunded housing and dining credit. The fellows programs are outstanding and provide extra opportunities for academic and personal advancement, some involve undergraduate research that the university provides a lot of help and instruction with. The study abroad programs are second to none. The community found at Elon is amazing, however the school is overwhelmingly white which is not very evident on the promotional pamphlets and social media. Elon's food is sustainable and delicious at all three dining halls. The residence halls are extremely well-kept and feel like home. Elon works well for people who are curious, want to ask questions and want to be engaged in classes. The Writing Center, Student Professional Development Center, and Academic Tutoring that students can turn to if they need help. Elon is also extremely inclusive by nature."
Sophomore,5,"Elon is amazing! We have wonderful faculty and staff that care about students' learning. So many go above and beyond to help students. The campus is absolutely gorgeous and there are so many fun and inspiring ways to get involved. The Burlington area was a little smaller of a town than I was used to, but Elon does a great job sponsoring events and student groups have events as well! That all, paired with the fact that Chapel Hill, Durham, and Greensboro are only a car ride away makes it so that there is always something fun to do! The classes at Elon are interesting and the food is pretty good (although you do get sick of it after awhile)."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Elon and I cannot say enough great things about this school. I do not take part in greek life and while some of my friends do (and admittedly greek life is pretty big here), there is so much to do other than parties and greek life. I have met friends for life (most of whom do not participate in greek life) and I really do feel like I'm getting a great education. The teachers really care about classes and students which is not the case at some other schools. The only thing I would say is a sticking point is the price. Elon offers two main scholarships or nothing at all and at the end of the day, the price tag almost drove me away from enrolling. However, I know it's an investment and I think it's worth the money. The last things I will say are it's fairly preppy here but I found my tribe and I could not be happier and it is in the south (i.e. it's not very diverse). Elon definitely is what you make it."
Freshman,5,"I loved the beautiful campus and the small class sizes. When I was touring it I fell in love instantly. It isn't in a city like I originally wanted, but it makes up for that in other ways."
Niche User,5,"My sister is a Junior at Elon University and I have never seen her this happy. She hates coming home because she wishes to be back at school. The school is academically difficult, but she is able to manage her time properly to enjoy her free time with her friends. She is in a sorority at the school but she believes their greek life is unlike most. She is friends with girls from many different sororities and has never felt that she wasn't able to be friends with other girls. She has been able to become her true self and I have seen her become a better person through the people she has met."
Freshman,5,"I have had a great experience both academically and socially at Elon. There are so many opportunities. However, like most universities, it is not for the procrastinators. I learned that the hard way, but there are much better alternatives to procrastinating as there are many opportunities for tutoring, one-on-one sessions with professors during office hours, proofing of writing assignments at the Writing Center, and so much more. If you don’t get lazy and take advantage of the opportunities that this university provides, Elon University is one of the best colleges to foster intellectual advancement and career readiness."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my Elon experience so far! The student to faculty ratio is so nice, as well as the beautiful campus and engaging classes."
Niche User,5,"As a parent, I couldn't be happier with Elon. So much so that I have a second child applying now. Yes, the campus is beautiful, but so is the academic community. Great teachers who know your child's name, amazing study abroad opportunities, and a vibrant social life are just a few of the wonderful things about Elon."
Niche User,5,"I am still a high school student but I had a close family friend who attended so I was there all of the time. The school is so warm and welcoming, it almost feels like home."
Sophomore,5,"I love Elon University not only for their push for the acceptance and success of their students but also in their work to ready their students for the working world. I found that I could get advice and help from teachers, staff and even upperclassmen. I love the inclusion Elon shows through the different events that are hosted around campus. I found that everyone on the Elon campus has their Elon way which is what I find amazing to learn about."
Senior,5,"I love this campus and the people I've met here. The facilities are gorgeous and there are so many great programs, clubs, and activities. The professors here are very engaging and truly care about their students. I also LOVE the small class sizes! Things that could improve are the gym (way too small) and the diversity."
Alum,5,"The ideal medium-small school experience. One of the most progressive, involved, and proactive administrations in the country and a fierce academic environment in the classrooms. Professors and students are closely connected and faculty as a whole is incredibly supportive and helpful. Students have a strong voice on campus and getting involved is easy and highly encouraged by all. Great value as well and it is impossible to overexaggerate the asthetic beauty of the campus."
Freshman,5,"Amazing overall experience. Beautiful campus, small class sizes, easy to get involved and always something fun going on."
Freshman,5,"Once I got into Elon, everyone there helped me answer any questions. I could tell they wanted me at the school. When I went to revisit I was welcomed with friendly faces. The campus is gorgeous!!"
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at Elon! It is not for everyone but if you are looking for a smaller school with a college town feel and want to be very close with your classmates and friends, then its perfect. Academics in the business school are tough and professors are really engaged. Everyone is hyper-involved in clubs and orgs and Greek life is big for girls. The party scene is great as long as you are fine with only having one bar. Everyone goes to Greek parties or house parties but it is great! Students are really loyal to the school and I have never heard of someone who did not love their experience."
Freshman,5,"I just got in!! I loved Elon from the first moment I stepped foot on the campus.  The students are all really nice, the campus itself looks like a country club.  There are tons of clubs and activities and my college rep. Ashley was amazing.  She was so helpful and really cared about me.  She took the time to call me personally to let me know I got in before I got the email.  I actually cried!! Elon class on 2023"
Junior,5,"Choosing to come to Elon has been the most important yet best decision I have made in my entire life. While I will admit my first semester was a bit rough, I quickly assimilated into the school and was able to make a ton of friends. The rumors are true- compared to other schools popular with students from the Northeast/Midwest, the student body is not as diverse. However, Elon is a mid-size private university that has made consistent strides over the decade to bring more diverse students to campus, and it seems to be working. 

Student life is very centered around academics and extracurriculars, and most students I know are involved in at least one organization and are passionate about the school and the local community. At least from my perspective, the academics are on par with Wake Forest and Davidson, and programs are only getting more competitive."
Sophomore,5,"I love Elon so much. The campus is great. It is honestly the most beautiful campus I have ever seen. The professors are wonderful and the students amazing.  The academic interest is so high and strong, but there is also a great student life too."
Sophomore,5,"I love it at Elon, as I write this it's summer break and I'm counting down the days till the start of fall semester! Just being on campus brings me joy, it's so beautiful that my friends and I refer to it as Elon Country Club, a joke that is made more funny by our on campus driving range and discounted student membership to the local country club. The academics are great and I was able to get a internship out of freshman year no problem. Fitting in is easy, if you are kid from NC or the northeast who likes to wear VV polos and sperrys you will bELONg (that's a tacky ass pun administration loves to use) here."
Sophomore,5,"Elon University is a terrific institution. The professors want you to succeed and grow as individuals, and their is an immense amount of support for students. The university offers many paths of support, such as job opportunities, financial aid, internship applications, and so much more."
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman at Elon University and I love it! I definitely feel like I picked the right college, you can't go wrong with Elon. The academics are incredible and the campus is gorgeous."
Freshman,5,"The layout of the campus allows you have a life outside of your classes that includes relaxing by the lake, eating with friends in downtown Elon, or catching up on homework in one of Elon's many study spaces. Many of the professors here have gone above and beyond to accommodate for any questions and concerns that I may have. Going to an out-of-state school is very nerve wracking at first, but I am glad that I picked Elon. Elon has become my home away from home in more ways than one and I often find myself counting down the days till I am back on campus. Elon's curriculum can be very intense at times; however, I am getting an education based on the work that I put in. One complaint that I have about Elon is paying for laundry. The cost adds up very quickly and is often frustrating that I have to pay so that I am able to wear clean clothes to class. However, that is the only negative that I have so it doesn't outweigh all of the positive things that Elon has to offer me."
Niche User,5,Elon's campus when I visited was beautiful! It was raining the day I visited and I still loved the campus and felt at home. It made my college decision easy feeling so safe and welcome on the campus.
Freshman,5,Elon University is an amazing place that is so welcoming to all students. I love their global emphasis on everything they do. There are so many students from so many different backgrounds and so many different countries. The school and professors really care about that students and want them to succeed. I wouldn't want to go to school anywhere else.
Freshman,5,"Elon is not as diverse as advertised, though they are making an effort to change that!

Beautiful. I don't know where else I would be!"
Alum,5,"Tight night community with lots of opportunities.  The career services department is very helpful and responsive.  Overall, excellent experience."
Freshman,5,"Elon is the perfect size where you can see familiar faces around campus but still meet new people every day. Class sizes are all small so you really get to know your professors and their subjects in depth. There is a real focus on the individual student at Elon, students often research alongside professors or conduct research on their own worthy of publication. There are many resources to help students succeed around campus, including the Student professional development center (SPDC) and the writing center."
Freshman,5,"I like the student involvement and how invested the faculty and staff are. 

Better way to improve would be more diversity in class and race"
Niche User,5,My older sister attends Elon and she tells me nothing but good things about the atmosphere and academics.
Senior,5,"really strong athletics, greek life and academics. lots of student run organizations and clubs. large selection of food. lots of different living spaces. great classes and strong faculty."
Freshman,5,"The reason why I chose Elon University is the people. They helped me understand what kind of education I would be gaining at the University, and helped me step by step with the process. My professors all reached out and communicated with me about what to except and if I have questions. It's also a beautiful college and theres a lot of financial help that can be offered. Very lively campus community and a lot of room for diverse lifestyles."
Works Here,5,"Elon is an incredibly student-centered university and it's all about hands-on, experiential learning. Global engagement is central to the curriculum and Elon has the #1 ranked study abroad program. Two-thirds of the campus has been built since 2000, and it's an outstanding environment for learning. Once you see Elon, you'll never want to leave."
Sophomore,5,"I am so happy that I gave Elon a chance because the school has been a very positive experience so far.  We all know the campus is amazing,  greek life is active and the people are beautiful but there is so much more.  I have found engaged professors, a well rounded workload and a supportive student body. The administration is working on the weak points by pursuing more diversity among applicants and pouring money into the sports teams.  The reason I think Elon is exceptional is because the curriculum focuses on getting  job in the real world.  Internships, meaningful study abroad, alum network  and engaging classes are all focused on the next step.  I am not rushing college but I am going to have a a good amount of debt and need a real exit plan and the administration seems to get it.  There is a good number of rich kids here and many partiers but overall people want a real plan and I appreciate that mind set."
Sophomore,5,Elon's engaged learning curriculum translates well into the small classroom atmosphere. The opportunities to get involved on campus combined with the study abroad programs allows for a well-rounded college experience.
Alum,5,"I had a great experience. It's def a work hard play hard school. Students are dedicated to their work, extracurricular activities but still def know how to have a good school. I met amazing people during my time there. There is a big greek life presence on campus though and it's in a small town so don't expect much to do outside of campus life. You have to drive 30min to get to a big city."
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience at Elon University have been great. Not only have I met great friends here, but the faculty has been excellent in supporting my needs for learning. I am a Music Production and Recording Arts major, and the music community is close knit and supportive. I have access to a lot of professional equipment as well as professors who are willing to facilitate my learning. Similarly, there are many ways to get involved on campus with any kind of interest."
Sophomore,5,"Great School for most majors, lots of oppurtunities, there is definitely an Elon Bubble, that dictates social life and campus involvement. It can often feel like people are competing to be more involved than the others."
Freshman,5,Love the feel of Elon...very welcoming and everyone is friendly.  Professors know you personally which is great.
Sophomore,5,"ELon is a wonderful place. It has the most beautiful campus you were ever see. Many people on this website bash Elon because they would probably end up not fitting in anywhere. Everyone I know LOVES ELON. The professors are so helpful, the food is good, the campus is georgous and it's just such a friendly, engaged, and social atmosphere. The only way you will not like this place is if you sit in your dorm on your computer and do nothing. Overall this school is an amazing place. Talk to someone in person about it and they will tell you. Don't let these reviews fool you."
College Sophomore,5,"Housing is first rate- Almost all the housing has been renovated or constructed within the past 10 years, and have all teh proper amenities of home."
College Sophomore,5,"I lived in the historic neighborhood and you're just so close to everything. You can walk out of your room and into your next class in 2 minutes which was awesome. I'm living in Daneilly next year which is quite a walk but I'm sure it'll be fine, lots of people live in that neighborhood and deal with it. Historic was very social and the housing process was pretty easy. I got lucky in getting an awesome roommate by doing random but I know some didn't get the best option."
College Sophomore,5,they do a good job
College Sophomore,5,"Fantastic professors, great classes, the workload is heavy and registration can be overwhelming, but Disability Services can be super helpful if you are in need of assistance."
College Sophomore,5,"I have loved the variety of courses and professors I have taken at Elon in my two years here. The class size is capped at 33 students, and the average class is around 24 people, which is what I love most about the class environment."
College Sophomore,5,"Business and Communicatiosn students are required to have an internship while at Elon, The alumni network is so strong and the Job & Internship Fair is always helpful. The Student Professional Development Center is one of the best resources on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"For first year students, there are a variety of options, none of which are bad. When applying for housing, first year students prioritize neighborhood. Neighborhoods open to first years are as follows:

Historic: About 700 first year students, most social neighborhood, biggest closets, themed around tradition, SIngle Sex and co-ed options, near a dining hall

Global: First year and sophomore students, Newest neighborhood, rooms vary, many Living Learning communities, themed around global engagement, near a dining hall

Colonnades: Open to all years, nice layout, closest to business school, near a dining hall, many Living Learning Communities, themed around sustainability, pretty quiet/less social

Danieley: farthest but really great setup. Mostly sophomores, some first years. Own fitness center, near retail food options, nice for business school students rather than comm."
College Sophomore,5,"At Elon, I have found my home. Now let me get this straight, at first, I was miserable and was convinced I wanted to transfer. But that was more just getting adjusted to college as a whole. I'm now incredibly involved on campus, hold multiple leadership positions, on campus jobs and I'm part of a few other organizations. Elon is unique because of the relationships you build here. I not only have made great friends, but I've made fantastic professional connections with my professors.  I would do it all over again, but maybe if I could skip the first month or so."
College Freshman,5,The SPDC does a great job of helping people with their job and internship search.
College Freshman,5,Most professors truly care about the well being of their students and most courses are appropriately challenging.
Sophomore,4,"I took a four courses online in the spring and am doing  two hybrid courses this fall. It was good overall, with most professors putting a lot of work in to make a good class. Unfortunately, Elon is made to be experiential learning and you can't get that from online courses."
Freshman,4,"I only had one professor who didn't take any care to make the class slightly easier considering the circumstances. Everyone else was super understanding, with minimal time spent live to account for students in different time zones, and extensions being offered as necessary."
Junior,4,Elon University is full of supportive professors and peers. This university pushes its students to be be their absolute best. The only downside is the location lacks things to do in the area and the university lacks diversity.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is absolutely breathtaking and makes you appreciate the school every-time you leave your dorm. Greek life is BIG.If you are a girl you MUST apply for the all girls dorm. I was in a coed dorm and still had a great experience and it was a lot of fun, but I wish I had the experience that some of my friends had. The school is expensive, but will work with you and even help you find scholarships or loans if needed. The absolute top of the line services when it comes to academic facilities. Small class sizes. Every professor I had made it a point to remember everyones name. They are always available during office hours, and they always email you back quickly. Haven't had a bad professor. The dining halls are great and offer healthy selections."
Alum,4,"I am convinced that Elon has some of the best educators in the country. I use skills I learned at Elon every day, and I honestly adored going to class. 
Social life depends a lot on what type of person you are. GREEK LIFE IS LIFE. When I went to school (graduated in 2015) we had an ongoing joke that everyone not in a sorority/fraternity was basically in a sorority/fraternity: we all knew each other. It also wasn't diverse at all -- very heavily populated by white, wealthy Northeasterners. 
But I eventually met the best friends of my life there after a rough first year, and I am very much not a sorority person. I also don't think I could have gotten a better education anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"Elon is a great place to attend school. As a freshman, I felt very much at home with lots of things to do on campus and lots of good food, too!"
Freshman,4,"I am currently a first year at Elon, and I have loved it so far! The professors genuinely care about how you're doing in class, as well as other aspects of your life. I have also already found many opportunities to be involved on campus, whether through sports, clubs, or an on-campus job. I was worried that the transition to college life would be very difficult, especially since I'd never been away from home for so long, but I quickly made friends during orientation who helped the transition seem not so scary. My only caveat is about learning disabilities services. While I do not have a learning disability myself, I have heard my friends who do talk about how disabilities resources has not always been able to meet their needs."
Freshman,4,"This was my dream school and I absolutely love it! I'm a person who loves school and learning but also likes to have fun and I'd definitely say its hard to balance work and the party scene here. I didn't realize how big the party scene was until I got here and I know a lot of people who have gotten behind because of it, so just prepare to juggle your work with going out a lot during the week and weekends."
Sophomore,4,"I like the professors - they are very invested in helping each student succeed. The small classes help strengthen student-teacher relationships. 
I dislike the diversity at the school - there is a majority of white students and there are not very many racial minorities. I would prefer a more diverse school in this way."
Freshman,4,Elon has an amazing study abroad program. Roughly 80% of the student body will travel during their time at Elon. This program helps expose our community to new cultures and help us be a more inclusive student body.
Niche User,4,"I like how friendly people are here. Whenever I first toured the campus, I knew it was the place for me. Professors are really engaging and truly care about their students."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Elon right now, in my first semester, and so far it is much better than expected. Most people (yes, including T-Pain) complain about the school being full of rich, entitled, white people, but this has not been what I've found. I was worried coming in as a student of lower financial standing when I believed all of my peers would be the opposite, but I've found that the majority of students are just like me. Sure, there are a few students with no financial burden at all that are aware of that and don't appreciate their position here, but it is certainly not the majority. I immediately felt very comfortable arriving on campus in August and am happy everyday that I made the decision to come here."
Freshman,4,"I love Elon. The school is gorgeous, the people are great, and the professors and staff here are so dedicated to helping everybody succeed and have the best college experience. My only real issue so far has been that this year the freshmen didn't get to pick which neighborhoods they wanted to be in since the school was trying to change the neighborhood stereotypes. However, this lead to even bigger issues between neighborhoods and even between halls. This made it much harder for me (and many people I know) to make friends early and all of my upperclassmen friends shared that they certainly didn't have these extent of issues when they were able to choose their neighborhoods.  That being said, all of the dorms and people are truly great, it just worked a lot better when people where able to be grouped by a shared value rather than just randomized."
Freshman,4,"Elon University has a beautiful campus, great professors, and great food all over campus. The entire campus is filled with people who are willing to help you, no matter what your problem is. The professors are open to talking to you and help you about any of your questions or concerns. Overall, Elon University is an amazing place that I would recommend to anyone in search of a future home for college."
Niche User,4,"They have a great theater program. It's strongest for acting, as opposed to design/tech. The campus is beautiful, and the library is huge, with friendly people there to help you find what you need. Plenty of on campus dining options, and decent food. The only downside I would explicitly list is the price tag."
Senior,4,"Elon University is a great school with caring professors, people, and students. They are constantly growing by adding new buildings and food options. The professors put a big emphasis on student success. The only thing I would change is the area surrounding Elon."
Alum,4,"great study abroad, good opportunities for student leadership, beautiful campus, good honors program, not a lot of diversity in student body"
Freshman,4,I love the school and how many opportunities there are. The one thing that I would like to see improve is the diversity on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I love my experience at Elon thus far. I feel that I have made great friends, I love my classes and professors and couldn’t ask for a more beautiful campus. I wish the tuition wasn’t as pricey or that their scholarships were better!"
Sophomore,4,Elon definitely prepares its students for the real world. Down fall is the culture surrounding the school and the student life lack to be inclusive of organizations and societies. Many Jewish kids feel left out even though their is a big Jewish organization.
Alum,4,Elon is a great school. I loved the majority of my time there. I got a great education. Their mental health resources are seriously lacking.
Senior,4,"Elon has a friendly, welcoming campus full of many educational opportunities I would hardly receive anywhere else. Due to the professionalism and excellent choice of faculty members on the school's part, their professors and educators are knowledgable, eager to help you achieve success, and actually take the time to know who you are as a student and who you want to be once you graduate. They will do anything to help you get to where you want to be in life and I am forever grateful that I decided to be an Elon student."
Sophomore,4,"Pros: Beautiful campus, great academics, dorms are pretty great, big social scene, tons of study abroad opportunities, many great professors, decent food, quaint town with big chain stores and restaurants a few miles away, “big” cities  farther away (a pro and a con)

Cons: lacks diversity!, too many east coast, snobby kids, expensive, Greek life kids can get pretty nasty, can feel isolated without own transportation as big stores and restaurants are too far away to walk"
Freshman,4,"I've really enjoyed my first year at Elon. It's a very supportive environment in many ways with lots of things to do on campus. I've had good experiences with the dining halls, excellent classes and professors, and good interactions with other students. I can see where some aspects of the school are not as focused on academics as others, and that, along with the level of diversity in the student body and in the faculty would be something I would like to see change."
Freshman,4,"I really like Elon. It a small school with small class sizes, which is my favorite part because you really get an opportunity to get to know your professors. They offer a good variety of classes but it can be kind of difficult to get the class times that you want.  The campus is beautiful and it's not too difficult to navigate. The food is average and the diversity is poor. Although the diversity isn't good, there are still a good amount of programs and resources available to minority students."
Alum,4,"Everyone knows the campus is beautiful and the study abroad options are endless. However, the options to find your group of people is rather difficult if you aren't starting your education at Elon from semester 1. The professors however are great which is what truly matters."
Freshman,4,I just finished my first semester at Elon. I love the school and think they do a great job trying to get students involved on campus and the people/professors are all very nice. Some of the freshman residential neighborhoods are better than others about having everybody get to know each other in those first few weeks. Overall I have really liked it here!
Freshman,4,Elon is a great university with a large offering of courses.  There are a lot of opportunities available as well.
Niche User,4,"Elon University has provided a great education, opportunity and experience so far. I wish they had more to offer their music majors in the way of interns and hope to be surprised in the coming year with new opportunities."
Senior,4,"I really like the School. I think it is a great place for young people to come and grow.  I think the environment is conducive to a lot of good conversations about race, sexuality, social class and has a a good mix of people willing  to have these conversations in a safe and open place.

Like any environment, it has it's bad apples but the majority want to understand each other and work together."
Senior,4,"The professors are the best in the state, which makes the academics amazing. The campus is beautiful. The dorms and food are well above average compared to other schools. However, Elon lacks in two aspects. The first is racial diversity, as Elon is almost entirely white. The second aspect is tuition. Elon is incredibly expensive to attend and the school has few scholarships."
Sophomore,4,"I wouldn't change my time at Elon for anything. For the first time in my academic career, I've been enrolled in classes that truly challenge me and teachers that make me apply course concepts to the broader world. The majority of students here are upper East Coasters which was a surprise to me once I arrived here. I've learned things both in the classroom and out. Elon does a good job hosting speakers, holding a variety of fun events, and incorporating international food in the cafeterias."
Freshman,4,Great School - Love the class sizes and most of my professors so far. Professors really care about your learning.
Freshman,4,"Elon is a warm, friendly environment. The strongest majors it offers are Communications and Finance. Sports Management is also a popular one. A majority of students are out of state, however many are from the East Coast. As a student from the West Coast, I felt a bit out of place. It also has a large Greek system so if you are not interested in joining, Elon might not be the place for you."
Sophomore,4,"Elon University is a very open and welcoming school. From time to time I forget that I am a minority on campus because we are all given equal opportunities and viewed the same. The faculty and staff work their hardest to help every student reach their full potential, pushing us to becoming future leaders. I am in love with the school, I truly feel like I bELONg. "
College Sophomore,4,Class size is small which us great.
College Sophomore,4,Very nice dorms but are expensive.
College Sophomore,4,"Just overall had great experiences with my professors, the curriculum, registration process, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"It's pretty abundant, but at the same time I haven't seen anyone have problems with it. It's what some people choose to do every weekend which is fine but I haven't known anyone or heard of anyone going to the hospital and most people who smoke weed regularly have been written up throughout the year. Alcohol is looked at much more leniently."
College Sophomore,4,I think like most campuses we have those blue buttons you can press if you feel unsafe and we have numbers you can call to be picked up in I think under 2 minutes if you don't feel safe walking somewhere.
College Sophomore,4,I felt like my professors really cared about the work that I was doing. I never felt strangled by school work and they constantly encouraged us to have good relationships with them outside of the classroom. I haven't had a class over 30 people yet and even in my larger classes I felt like I could always speak up and answer questions. How much you get out  of the class definitely correlates with how much you put in but I thought the professors do a good job of facilitating discussion and expression of different opinions in each class.
College Sophomore,4,"Although I only just finished freshman year, I feel confident in my career prospects. I'm a film major and I've already made connections with other film majors which is a huge step in creating great things and networking towards career opportunities after graduation."
College Sophomore,4,very comfortable yet challenging  environment
College Sophomore,4,career prospects play a huge role
College Sophomore,4,hard to get what you want
College Sophomore,4,very important at that school
College Sophomore,4,good spirit but small school
College Freshman,4,There are several modes of protection for students.
College Freshman,4,Elon has so many connections in regard to the job world and they prepare you for the world of jobs with career fairs.
College Freshman,4,"Most of the professors that I have had are very passionate about what they teach. The classes and the work they give are hard and challenging, but most of them teach the information very well."
College Freshman,4,Some buildings are older than others and you can tell which residential places those are. But overall in every neighborhood. There seems to be a lot of space and not one residential neighborhood is worse than the other.
College Freshman,4,There are various people that participate sports and go to the games and such. There is also a number of people that do not care about the athletic scene.
College Freshman,4,"My school is beautiful and has so many opportunities that are offered and many activities that will suit anyone that comes to the school. The work is challenging, but it prepares you for the real world."
College Sophomore,4,"Constantly parties, some frats, some club sports. Tons of pre-games, as for clubs and bars, they're more limited."
College Sophomore,4,"Frats and Club Sports at off campus houses. Only thing that happens on campus are pre-games. Impacts every student differently, can be avoided."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus crime is very limited. I have always felt safe, and we run on the blue light system. Campus Security is always willing to drive or escort you home, plus Safe Rides is a great option for students on the weekends to prevent drunk driving. Sexual Assault is always an issue on college campuses, but we have great resources for victims."
College Sophomore,4,"Delayed Recruitment is a big plus when it comes to Greek life at Elon. Without it, I don't think that Greeks and non-Greeks would mix as much. It doesn't totally dominate the culture, but it can seem like it on occasion."
College Freshman,4,"Generally very safe, but alcohol mixed with frat boys always creates danger."
College Freshman,4,"The process for housing is confusing and some places are much better than others, but nice overall"
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. Campus Police are always there to help if you need anything. They will walk you home if you leave the library late. There is rarely crime on campus.
Junior,2,"I am a transfer and non-traditional student at Elon and I feel very much out of place. There are some really dedicated professors (and faculty) who do know their stuff and there are some solid academic programs. The campus is absolutely gorgeous. Other than that, there's not really much else to praise. There is hardly any diversity in any sense -- age, race, religion, socioeconomic background. If you don't fit into a certain mold, you will not likely not have an easy time here. People are pretentious, entitled and obnoxious. About half of girls and a third of boys are Greek. Greek life is VERY VERY prominent. For guys, it isn't as tough to be non-Greek but girls seem to have a harder time. 

If I didn't love the academic program I'm in and some of my professors, I think I definitely would have transferred (again). It was not what I expected when I first enrolled."
Sophomore,2,"I am a minority student in a not very diverse school and town. While most people are very nice and welcoming, I have weekly experiences that remind me that I am not a traditional white student, specially at parties after people had a few drinks and the occasional administrator. The campus and facilities are very nice and modern, but it is not a very challenging institution. I think I used to work a lot harder in high school."
College Sophomore,2,"Academically, it is fine. The teachers are attentive and the classes are usually pretty small, which makes it easier to form relationships. However, the overall student population is shallow. I strongly dislike being here."
College Sophomore,2,"Academically, it's okay, but the general population lacks depth. A majority of students care too much about looks, money, and greek life. I really would not recommend this school."
College Sophomore,2,"I found it to be childish, and it fractured the social groups as it moved to consume the entire campus. The initial groups of  residents in the first-year housing made quick bonds early in the academic year, only to have them squashed by rushing and Greek life. So by the end of the year most if not all freshmen are members of greek life, leaving the others(unaffiliated) to venture on by themselves. Overall, Greek life is huge at Elon. It's a huge plus if your into partying and all that; But a negative if you're not. There is enormous pressure to join a Greek organization, perhaps more pressure than students should be putting on themselves to choose a meaningful major."
College Sophomore,2,"If you aren't up for greek life I would find a new school. Seems like everything that happens on campus revolves around greek life and unfortunately it is either you are part of greek life or an athlete, otherwise you are on the outside."
College Sophomore,2,"Just bad overall, ethnically, economically, and geographically. Most people are white, upper middle class, and from the NorthEast. But with that said, I know Elon is working on this and recognize that it is a problem."
College Freshman,2,most people assume you will rush
College Sophomore,2,"Academics are outstanding, social environment is horrendous"
College Sophomore,2,"I'm an Exercise Science major, and our department is housed in the Koury Center, the same building that our gym is. The Koury Center is old. It desperately needs a renovation. Most buildings on campus are absolutely amazing, but this is not one of them. The gym lacks equipment, it lacks space, it lacks proper A/C. As someone trying to get into bodybuilding, it's impossible since we don't have enough machines or types of benches. I get that I might just be picky, however, even for the normal cardio junkie student, our gym is inadequate. There is not enough cardio equipment. Even if you come at the weirdest times, the cardio equipment is still always in use aside from maybe a few machines. Half the time, pieces of equipment are broken. During winter term, the hamstring curl and quad extension machines were both broken and it took a month to be fixed. Those are prime leg day machines. There's also no air circulation and it's like 75 degrees upstairs. I sound like a snobby brat, but Elon has a VERY fit student population, so the facilities are really lacking in regards to the high demand. 

There's a nice field house for the D1 athletes with better strength training equipment, however, it is only open to athletes. Unfortunate.

Our soccer team and basketball team are pretty good, whereas football is a struggle but we're getting there. The tailgates before the football games are well attended and fun. Club sports are really competitive and a lot of students join those or at least intramurals. Intramurals are easy to join and there are a wide variety of options."
College Freshman,2,"Our teams are not very good-- especially our football team, which is unexpected for a Southern school with d1 football. No one really cares about the football team's performance and people don't really go to the games. Our men's soccer team on the other hand is very good, and their games are attended, but there is very little school spirit surrounding athletics at Elon."
College Freshman,2,The health center is the most frustrating part of the health system at Elon. It's a million miles away and never open when you need it. You also have to schedule an appointment which us tedious.
College Freshman,2,Athletics just aren't that big here. Club sports and intramural sports can be just as big a deal as varsity sports.
College Freshman,2,"Elon defiantly attracts a certain type of person. People here are usually smart but they're also self centered, ""perfect"", rich, preppy, bitchy, and selfish. Honestly I haven't met that many people I genuinely like or relate to even though the school isn't that small, everyone is very similar. Elon is also very greek, which isn't a bad thing but its always a presence on campus. For me I will definitely not be coming back next year, I don't like the people and I hate the town. There is honestly nothing to do, the frats are all the same and theres nothing to do in town and unless you have a car to go to Alamance crossing every once in a while, but there are no clubs or shopping or many food options close to campus. That being said there are also no job opportunities unless you have a car or want to work for the school. While I don't feel like its Elon's fault that I don't like it here, all of this is definitely a thing for incoming students to be aware of. If you don't fit into those things I previously mentioned you probably won't like it here."
College Freshman,2,"Because my school just recently became an NCAA Division 1 school, the varsity sports are definitely not up to par for the division and it shows. Coming from a high school that placed such a large emphasis on our prowess in the sports arena, as well as a city whose local university houses one of the top Division 1 basketball and football teams, I am very biased and harsh in my criticisms of my current university for its underwhelming mediocrity. I will admit, however, that the support that the athletes receive is very similar to what I am used to back home, in that there is a lot of pride, school spirit and overall encouragement for our team, regardless of the score."
College Junior,2,Very little diversity between students.
College Junior,2,"Elon is a growing school so the network is still really small. Unless you're studying comm, there aren't a lot of opportunities for jobs and internships through Elon beyond the Raleigh-Durham area. They have some connections to the big firms, but it can be hard to find less competitive and more attainable options. They do a really good job preparing students for interviews and in creating resumes and cover letters."
College Junior,2,"Despite being Division I, nobody on campus really pays much attention to sports. Basketball brings in the biggest crowd and baseball is sometimes attended in the spring. Our football team is really weak but there is still a pretty good tailgating scene and homecoming is widely celebrated on campus. Our student body is really active and many students play club or intramural or exercise regularly. Our gym facilities have everything you need to get in shape."
College Freshman,2,"There are very few scholarships available on campus, especially need-based since many students come from wealthier families. Was categorized as not needed aid, but still need to take student loans. Merit based scholarships are small and do not reflect increasing tuition."
College Sophomore,2,I have a hard time finding scholarship.
College Freshman,2,"Elon's student body is over all mostly wealthy, white, and straight, with a lot of Catholics.  I've had a hard time finding anyone genuinely unique/interesting."
College Sophomore,2,"Meal plans are expensive and not worth it! The only way to get good food is to pay way more for a +7 or +14 plan, which are not worth what they cost."
College Freshman,2,Social life lacks if you don't live near your friends or are not involved in greek life.
College Freshman,2,There are about 3 options to eat at off campus in walking distance.
College Freshman,2,Everything is more than 10 minutes away outside of a few options
College Freshman,2,"Dining halls are sh*t, retail options are okay but get old quickly"
College Freshman,2,"Varsity sports are a joke, club and intramural sports can be fun"
College Freshman,2,School spirit doesn't lie with our Varsity sports.
College Freshman,2,Burlington is in the middle of no where but there are places to go but not much to do.
College Freshman,2,Burlington is in the middle of no where so campus housing is hard to find. However millpoint is very nice but incredibly expensive. the houses off campus are falling a part and small.
College Freshman,2,"In Elon, there is absolutely NOTHING to do. Greensboro and Raleigh/Durham are neat cities and have a lot to do, but are both a minimum of an hour's drive away."
College Freshman,2,Cheap restaurants with crappy food.
College Freshman,2,"I can only speak to my experience as a minority. It is WEAKKKK. Especially since I'm from a big city, I'm used to much more live parties or at least a lot more party options for minorities. However the lack of diversity does not lend itself to minorities when it comes to partying."
College Freshman,2,"Coming from a big city (Philly), the local atmosphere of Elon, North Carolina is terrible to me. Life would be so much better if I had a car and could visit other schools, especially because i am a person of color. Honestly, if you're white you may never feel the need to leave campus so the local atmosphere may be tolerable for you."
College Freshman,2,"Academically this is a great school. They provide each student with an abundance of opportunity to get involved and are really supportive in helping a student become more involved with clubs, organizations and internships within in the community. They are very focused on the well being of the student and their success at Elon. They provide great facilities for the students, nice gym, good dorms for the most part, nice classrooms, awesome library, good food at the cafeterias. The problem I find at Elon is the lack of diversity and the social scene. I feel as if I am stuck in a bubble with all of the same type of students, vast majority are preppy spoiled northerners who bring shape the social experience to be extremely dramatic. I don't find the students very mature, I find the way students deal with issues very similarly to high school. People gossip, you think it is a big campus however everyone seems to know everyone and gains a reputation quickly. I don't find the students very friendly or trust worthy. Greek life is a huge part of the social scene, I find a lot of the rushing and pledging process to be oriented around very fake criteria."
College Junior,2,This school does not offer much in scholarship opportunities and the scholarships that are available barely cover the ultimate cost of tuition here at school.
College Junior,2,Many fast food options and chain restaurants but very limited healthy food options off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Everyone is white, preppy, and from a high economic status"
College Freshman,2,People should be able to receive more financial help when they need it. Pepole love the school and want to come here but some won't get the chance with the amount of money they are given to attend. Students would enjoy the school more if they re able to receive more money when they perform well
College Freshman,2,Administration needs to be more strict with noise in the dorms during the week. Make sure RAs are following the quiet hour times and enforcing them. There has been multiple times i have not been able to sleep when i have an early class the next day because of people out in my hall screaming.
Junior,1,"I am on my third semester at Elon as a transfer student from a community college. I haven’t made a single friend there because the students are absolutely terrible privileged kids. I tried actually getting someones attention today and they clearly and bluntly ignored me.  That’s not even my first bad experience with a student, I’ve had plenty. Great group of kids here Elon, they really make you feel like you’re worthless and a loser. I don’t get it, I really don’t."
Alum,1,"Elon is a bridge to nowhere
A straight up diploma mill
65% acceptance rate means ELON is no more
Than a check clearing business."
Niche User,1,There is absolutely nothing to do in Elon.  The school does not encourage you to do anything at night.  I have spoke to several parents that their kids never leave their rooms except to go to class. So if you want to go to a beautiful school full of preppy white kids this is the school for you.
Sophomore,1,"if I could rate zero stars I would this place is nothing more than the high school you hated, but now you sleep here. Useless bunch of wealthy brats, who will all work with the family business after four years of drinking here.  Greeks are exclusive, prof's are not focused. Elon is a magic trick, you write the check Elon makes your parents money disappear.  You can be the town drunk and not go here."
Sophomore,1,"Absolute joke of a school. Elon is just a business for cashing checks that parents write. I've never had such horrible teachers before in my life. If you're unlucky enough to get a bad teacher, who gets fired after one semester, where the class average is a D, you're stuck with that grade. While good teachers are hard to come by at Elon, so is good food. The dining halls here are so bad. I'm really not sure what I'm eating half the time. For my almost 50k a year, this school really doesnt act like it."
Sophomore,1,Elon is a haven for wealthy aimless failed prep school kids. I'm in a sorority and its pathetic as girls are in tight cliques and no one looks out for or cares about any one else. It's a marketing machine selling a great facade but few kids here are motivated and it's a loser party school . Some solid professors especially in finance but many are international and very difficult to understand.  Very poor connections to the business community.  I'm transferring it's a waste of time.
Sophomore,1,"ELON IS A CHECK CLEARING BUSINESS, ACCEPTANCE DIRECTLY RELATED TO ABILITY TO PAY, ELON IS ABRIDGE TO NOWHERE, ELON IS A JOKE, IF I COULD TRNSFER I WOULD...STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLOWN COLLGE....."
Freshman,1,"I played football at Elon and had every scholarship and grant I could and it still was financially not worth the year I spent at the school.
The business department is littered with professors that have no clue what their talking about and it's obvious that Elon just hired many of them because they are outspoken liberals or minorities. All of my other classes tended to have the same biases especially philosophy where my teacher neglected to read my papers which forced me to go to the school board.
Student life is full of fraternities and sororities, most of these kids have known each other before coming to Elon!
Unless all of your best friends in the world are going to Elon there is no reason to apply to this school. There are many other great schools to give your money to that are much better value for education. And if you are prospective athlete, unless you are being offered a full ride, I would look somewhere else."
Freshman,1,"Elon is essentially a country club full of rich, privileged, white kids. Located in the middle of no where with nothing to do but drink!"
Freshman,1,"Absolutely awful first semester. None of my professors cared about my actual learning and were more concerned with grades. Quite frankly I'm surprised they even learned everyone's names. As far as the students, they are all carbon copies of each other. Everyone is rich, white, and preppy. If you're looking for a challenging and stimulating academic environment with diverse peers this is NOT THE PLACE."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life runs the school and it is very shallow here. (If you're attractive, have drive a car on campus, you'll likely get in)"
College Sophomore,1,"Parties are gross and grimy, but there's nothing else to do."
College Sophomore,1,"No diversity and certainly no interaction between racial and economic groups. Faculty and staff want to change this, but students don't care."
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't drink you're a nerd, if you smoke you're a convict. People are really judge-y."
College Sophomore,1,SUPER cliquey and if you're not part of it you're excluded (unless you're a girl at a frat party)
College Sophomore,1,"GREEK LIFE LITERALLY DOMINATES THIS SCHOOL AND IT NEEDS TO CHANGE. 

People who NEVER would have gone Greek feel the need to just because a majority of people are affiliated.

Girls who get dropped from the rush process get super sad and want Elon to add another sorority, but we already have 9 and already near 70% of females are involved in Greek Life. (The number admissions advertises is before the first years rush so it's majorly skewed) So the LAST thing we need is another sorority. We just need to overall change the campus climate so people don't feel the need to rush to have friends and to be involved in the school. We have 200+ other organizations people can join and immerse themselves in, but I've found that a lot of those organizations it's hard to make close friends in since people most strongly identify with their greek life sisters and don't feel the need to make friend groups in other outlets. Which is frustrating since I'm looking to make super close friends when sorority girls are all set with their sorority sisters. If you're in Greek Life, sure, you might love your sorority and you might not rank this as ""The worst"" but I think whether Greek or not, it is not okay how divisive and cliquey and dominating Greek life is on our campus. It's not a healthy campus culture."
College Junior,1,The SPDC is pretty terrible.
College Junior,1,Greek life is divisive and petty.
College Freshman,1,"It's tough being different in any capacity here on campus. If you're not white, preppy, straight, and well off financially, you will find it tough to fit in. The campus is large enough to find your niche if you look hard enough for it, but it may take some looking. The campus staff on the other hand is very good at making you feel accepted, but the students are indifferent and varied."
College Junior,1,Only frat parties. Only drinking until you black out.
College Freshman,1,"The health center is so far from everything!!! When you get there there is usual a 2 hour wait. And then they never know what you have!!! 

I had mono...they told me it was nothing and then I had to get rushed to the hospital the next day. I needed a doctors appointment off campus and they told me they would make the appointment and they forgot."
College Freshman,1,"If you're a girl you can get into anything, but no guys will be able to get in unless they are involved."
College Freshman,1,"All of the parties are monotonous and regularly include drinks with drugs added. Parties are easy to get into as a girl, but you are taken advantage of almost as soon as step foot in the room."
College Freshman,1,I did not receive any aid when peers who are much less intelligent than I did.
College Freshman,1,#4 frat school in the nation (which sucks if you're not greek).
College Freshman,1,"Alamance county has one of the largest KKK chapters and has a huge problem with human trafficking because of the freeways. Other than that, the Burlington people are very unfriendly because we're a bunch of stuck up, rich, white kids."
College Junior,1,The local area is not a college town or a city of any type. There are not job opportunities in the area surrounding Elon so I do not know why someone would choose to stay in the area unless they were at Elon for graduate school.
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing to do. Painfully uneventful. Most interesting thing around is 30 minutes away in Greensboro, where virtually nothing happens. And then 40 minutes away in Raleigh, but even then, there's not that much to do."
College Sophomore,1,"No real off-campus dining options, at all. If you want fast food, you have a few options. But there are very few restaurant options, and the ones we do have are average quality."
College Sophomore,1,like the princeton review states  best run diploma mill in the south
College Sophomore,1,"Diversity is Elon's biggest issue. They're trying to work on it - anyone will tell you that - but for the most part, people agree that the student body is very homogenous. There have been a few isolated incidents of racism in the last two years."
College Freshman,1,It's so boring and there's no nightlife. It's not a college town and Burlington is very run down and boring. There's a huge difference between the campus and the surrounding town. There's no culture or things to do on the weekends outside of campus.
College Freshman,1,"I am filling out this survey in hopes of receiving the scholarship that is tied to it because Elon gave me a comically small amount of financial aid. My family wanted to make it work, but with less than 4.5% of my $40k tuition being covered by this wealthy school, we are simply unable to. After talking with numerous other students, it seems that the school is only willing to help with financial aid if you pester them enough. I am still in the process of talking with workers at the financial aid office, trying to receive the financial aid needed to stay at the school. It has been quite a hassle."
College Junior,1,"the kids at my school all seem very much alike.  but the school is working on its diversity across all bases.
"
College Freshman,1,Its a different world where everyone is stuck up and judgmental and noatywr what everyone is judging no matter what.
College Freshman,1,I got no scholarships. With all the money this school has you would think they would give merit. But no. They don't.
College Freshman,1,"I am so isolated. There is nothing to do. If you want to do something to do, find someone with a car. The town isn't even a town and has two good restaurants and a coffee shop (university owned). The community doesn't seem to look up to Elon students or the university, which makes it uncomfortable to be in it. There's Alamance Crossing, which has a ton of stores, but again. You need a car."
College Freshman,1,"Overall experience is poor. I love my professors, the looks and location of the school itself, and the opportunities available for me. Campus dining is amazing with so many options available. There are great options for students to utilize tutoring and help from graduate students in their classes. Yet, the social scene and atmosphere makes me despise the school. The personality of the kids and their attitudes makes the school very unappealing and unbearable at times. "
College Freshman,1,"Everyone is very preppy as a whole, each person trying to conform to the new and cool 'norm'; I find the girls to be stuck up and rude and the boys to be very very rude on most occasions. "
College Freshman,1,"Greek life consumes in my opinion 80% of students on campus, which is very unappealing to me. It is hard to find the GDI's or non-greeks on campus and also hard to fit in without joining PHC."

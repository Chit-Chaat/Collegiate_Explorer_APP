Freshman,5,"This college has taught me the idea of being independent and responsible. This college has healed many of my hurts and hangups. Overall, coming to Oak Hills has been a blessing in so many ways."
Sophomore,5,"This is a truly amazing school.  They are extremely personal and the whole staff really cares about you personally.  I have only finished one year at this school, and I am looking forward to whatever the next three years bring."
College Sophomore,5,"Morals Are Upheld – We are a small Christian College which adheres to the Biblical code of morality, meaning that underage drinking, drugs, and so forth and strictly (and justly) prohibited. However, the vast majority of the students here follow these rules freely and disciplinary action is rare, and what action there is is done with kindness and gentleness."
College Senior,4,Christian college with high expectations on behavior
College Senior,4,"Community service is a part of curriculum, as well as built in internships."
College Senior,4,"Very accomodating, professors schedules are flexible and they are available for individual meetings."
College Senior,4,"Great people, it's like a family, small college."
College Junior,4,I really like going into downtown. There are a few coffee shops and thrift stores that are very cute and have great prices. Book stores are my favorite and even some of the thrift stores sell books too! There is a little mall with some good stores to choose from as well.
College Sophomore,4,"In the Pastoral Ministry program at Oak Hills Christian College, you not only get taught hands on preaching pointers from one of the best professors on campus but you also get taught life lessons from all of the staff/faculty that take the time each day to ask you ""How's it going?"". The professors are fantastic role models! This past year, I was not a big fan of Old Testament History (especially when we had to learn the order of all of the kings) but the professor, well, she made the class enjoyable by her 'down-to-earth' attitude ever single day. It's not a chore to learn at Oak Hills but it is a chore to grow and that's exactly why I love it so much. I have grown in my walk with Christ so much and I have made many great friendships simply by asking THEM ""How's it going?"". Additionally, the college atmosphere at OHCC makes learning enjoyable anytime and anywhere."
College Junior,4,"Bemidji is a pretty nice place to be - there's a lot of coffee shops and some good pubs downtown. There's a small mall, a variety of restaurants (though they lack sushi places), and a good variety of oddities to do. The town doesn't slow down in the winter (if it did, there would be a problem). And so long as you travel in packs at night (at least one other person) you'll be fine. (You probably would be anyway, but as a precaution, friends are good to bring along.)"
College Junior,4,"I'm in the Applied Psychology and Biblical Studies double major, and I love it. The work load can be a little overbearing at times, but it's doable and help is available. The head professor for Psych is great and has been in his field for a while now. He's helpful when it comes to internships, and from what we've heard from all psych graduates is that if you plan on getting your masters, you're prepared for it."
College Junior,4,"For a small school, we do pretty well - though compared to bigger schools we don't have a lot of choice. However, what we lack in variety is made up for in academics. We have small class sizes and great professors that can really get to know you and your work. They're able to push you to achieve more than what you might at other schools."
College Junior,2,Not really sure how to answer this question as I don't understand the focus on parting when talking about college. Oak Hills doesn't have bars or clubs (or transportation for that matter). We have fun on campus with each other - but not because of alcohol or a need for going clubbing.
College Junior,2,"It's Minnesota. If you think the weather here is always a delight, you've never lived in the northern states. It gets cold, cars don't always start, and it snows A LOT. Classes rarely get canceled due to snow, but we always have fun ice fishing, playing hockey, and playing in the snow."
College Freshman,2,"School Rules – Note: CHRISTIAN college. Second note: I don't understand this 'grading system'... The dorms have pretty strict rules about when the oppisite gender can visit, but the appartments for older have more freedom. It's a smoke and alcohol free campus, with a lot of other activities to keep a person busy!"

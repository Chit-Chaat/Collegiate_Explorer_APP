Junior,5,"I am a third year student at Oakland University and so far in my academic career I love the campus and academic program! Professors and advisors are informative and always willing to help with any issues that arise during the semester. The campus is safe, clean, and diverse. Amazing college overall."
Junior,5,I am taking courses online due to the pandemic and professors are doing amazing with the adjustment. They are extremely helpful and diligent with grading material and getting grades out efficiently.
Freshman,5,The accommodations for all on-line learning was efficient. Professors are utilizing the platforms and students are engaged.
Freshman,5,"very welcoming, even with classes on-line.  Plenty of activities and organizations to participate in."
Niche User,5,"I would give it 4.5 stars. Overall the experience has been smooth. I would like to see their website become a little more user friendly, as some pages and their search is a little outdated. Counselors get back in a timely fashion which is amazing!"
Niche User,5,So far Zoom has been awesome and informative. I personally prefer the pre-recorded lectures that way you can go back and rewatch/listen if you feel you have missed any information.
Freshman,5,Professors really help when a student is struggling with a concept and they leave lines of communication open
Freshman,5,"So far, classes have been great! I feel like I really retain the information I am taught during lectures because my professors at OU make it interesting and engage with the class, even in the craziness of covid"
Freshman,5,"Oakland University is a highly underrated college. Students can get the degree they want while always feeling that they are in a safe environment. The staff and faculty are always willing to help and there is always free tutoring available. One great thing about OU is that the campus is tightly knit, so you will never feel like you're alone. I highly recommend that every student participates in a student organization reflective of their major, lifestyle, or personality. It's a great way to make you become a better person. I'm glad I chose to attend Oakland University."
Freshman,5,"I only had one class that was online learning, but, that one class was executed perfectly. Not too much was asked of me and the teacher really understood the students home lives and was able to adapt to fit each students needs."
Junior,5,"Due to Covid-19, in April 2020 our classes were transferred from classroom to online lecture in the matter of 7 days. I couldn't believe how well each teacher organized the page to include each week's material and allowed us to keep on track easily with all that was going on. Also, the way that some teachers did the lecture by recording their screen or doing a live online lecture worked just as well for me as the in-person lecture. I've taken online classes also in Summer 2020 that were already established online classes, and the main thing I love is the organization of all the class material. You always know what the week's assignments consists of and some classes allow you to work ahead on the material!"
Junior,5,"I recently transferred from Oakland Community College to Oakland University in Winter 2020. A big difference for me was the amount of different teachers offered for each class. This made a huge difference for me because at OCC I didn't have as many options with teachers and class times, which sometimes was difficult for me with my work schedule. OU offers a ton of class time options and that's one of my favorite parts about it. Also, the buildings are organized, the cops are constantly patrolling the school ground, the campus is clean, and around and on campus are so many options to eat.
However, I dislike one thing. For certain buildings like the Human Health Building where most my classes are, parking runs out fast at busy times during the day and you have to park almost half a mile away at a different building's parking lot. When this happens for me, I usually become late for class even though I come about 45 minutes early to school every day."
Senior,5,"With the covid pandemic, Oakland University has done an incredible job in keeping the students safe. As a nursing student, I feel like the faculty are really working to help the students get their clinical hours. I can truly say I feel like I am still learning and they are just so caring!"
Senior,5,"I am taking Nursing classes online due to covid, and I think the professors are doing a great job! I feel like I am learning!"
Senior,5,"I have commuted to OU for the last 3 years and have had a great experience at this school! One of the things that I love the most is that it is rated the safest campus in Michigan and the third safest in the nation. The campus itself is beautiful, student life thrives in a wide variety of clubs and organizations, and the university's president stays well connected to the student body. The surrounding city has many great places to study, hang out, and work for college students as well."
Senior,5,I truly enjoy oakland. I have appreciated all the opportunities and classes that I have been able to afford here at a good and credible level.
Senior,5,I have taken many classes online at Oakland. I personally have had a very positive experience with them.
Senior,5,perfect size school. Food court needs to be better. Some professors are very good while others aren't.
Junior,5,"I very much enjoyed my past year at Oakland University. Along with the beautiful picturesque campus, numerous resources are available at your disposal. Professors and faculty are always ready to help with any problem that arises."
Sophomore,5,"For me personally, Oakland University is a great school. I really enjoyed the campus and everyone is very friendly. However, even though I didn’t have any complaints, a lot of my friends and classmates did. Oakland is not a big party school so if you’re looking for that, I suggest going somewhere else. It’s definitely more academically focused more than anything, not much emphasis on anything else (sports, clubs, etc.). I’m not much of an extrovert so Oakland was perfect for me. All my professors were very understanding and always helpful as well as the rest of the staff. I lived in Oakview so my dorms were really nice and clean, one of the best I’ve ever seen, but I don’t know about any of the dorms. Overall, I very much enjoyed my first year at Oakland and can’t wait to go back in the fall."
Junior,5,Everything about OU is amazing. I would like to see healthier food choices offered to students. A lot of the food is processed fast food which is not a great option.
Sophomore,5,"Great variety of majors and classes, incredibly active student life. So many different opportunities to join groups, clubs, and activities."
Junior,5,I am pursuing a degree I love that fits me just right! It makes learning so much easier when you enjoy it.
Alum,5,"I loved the experience I had here. I graduated in 5 years with my Bachelor's in Health Sciences. I worked on campus as an admissions ambassador as well as an admissions programming assistant. I was involved with an organization called HOSA which allowed students to be able to go to competitions. I lived on campus 3 of my 5 years and made many friends during my time at OU. The environment was welcoming and felt a lot like home. I was not far from home either, about an hour drive if I wanted to come home. To this day the school is expanding and renovating allowing it to look more beautiful than ever.  Oakland allowed me to branch and grow into the individual I am today and I am currently working on becoming a nurse. This school gave me better communication, leadership and teamwork skills that will allow me to become a great nurse. My overall experience with OU was amazing! It taught me so much and I am forever grateful for the experiences I gained from being here."
Junior,5,"Oakland University is an excellent campus, filled with amazing staff and professors willing to help you achieve your greatest potential and assist you all the way into achieving your goals and dream. The student atmosphere is also very friendly, with tons of opportunities to meet new people and build relationships through clubs or intramural sports!"
Junior,5,I love Oakland University! This is my  first full year as a undergrad student here. I transferred from another school. All the professors and advisors have been very helpful so far! My grades have improved greatly at this school. The campus is so pretty and everyone I have met so far has been really nice. My younger sister just started here last semester as well and loves it too.
Senior,5,"Within the journalism department, the teachers are AMAZING. I never feel stressed or worried about receiving help from the professors because they make sure they are available to assist you. I've learned so many valuable skills that will help me with my future career no matter what it is."
Senior,5,"Advisors are decently helpful! The atmosphere is very warming, plus the food choice is amazing! It transferred into OU and it was the easiest transfer Ive experienced."
Senior,5,"I transferred to Oakland from a community college and have loved every second of it! The counselors and staff are amazing and the level of opportunity is immense. There is always student involvement and outside activities happening and even if you do not go there, sitting on campus is beautiful in itself. I have loved every second of attending this college!"
Junior,5,"Oakland University is a great college for many reasons. First of all, they have excellent dorms, that are set up to give you a feel of a community. Second, they offer a penalty of activities to do when you are not studying so you are never bored.  the food at the cafeteria and food court offer plenty of options for food so you can always find something you like. Last but not least Oakland wants there students to succeed in whatever career you choose, so they offer a lot of free touting to assist you in even the toughest classes."
Sophomore,5,There is plenty of opportunity for on-campus involvement. The faculty I have had the experience of meeting have been incredibly pleasant. They  have been very forgiving and respectful.
Alum,5,"I loved Oakland University! The majority of the professors I had were so nice and very understanding. I also loved that Oakland was a commuter school, so I was able to save a lot of money during my undergrad. I feel that I got a really good education because the majority of the professors are so intelligent and love what they teach. I also felt very safe on Oakland's campus. The university has great security throughout the campus. While I may have missed out on the student life throughout my undergraduate career, I still will not regret going to Oakland University."
Niche User,5,I've visited the campus several times as an incoming 2020 fall freshmen and they are very friendly. the staff and the students are very helpful and are always there to answer my questions and help me to the best of their abilities.
Freshman,5,Great school if you want to focus on your studies without too many distractions. Amazing dining hall and nice clean dorms. Great atmosphere. They've done a really good job with resources for students and getting students involved. The campus is quite pretty and if you're commuting in the morning you can enjoy the sunrises depending where your class is (it's the little things in life). Very nice Rec Center. Over all great school.
Alum,5,I've been visiting Oakland University since I was about 3 years old. My experience with the college has been inspiring and motivational. It has also persuaded me to apply for nursing and now I am an admitted freshman in the upcoming 2020 fall semester.
Senior,5,"Great school for typical and unconventional students, the political science and language departments are excellent. The professors are extremely encouraging, smart, and helpful. I have loved every minute of my time at OU.  The students and staff are also very helpful.  Lastly, the campus lovely and manageable with a beautiful new Oakland Center, you can get to any class on campus within 15 minutes, walking."
Sophomore,5,"So far, I have LOVED attending college at Oakland University. I have made so many new friends. They offer so many different courses and clubs to attend and be apart of. The atmosphere is so welcoming and naturally beautiful. Every professor I have had so far has been wonderful. It is a great school with very helpful and kind people."
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Oakland University has been amazing. Oakland University offers a lot of student life with their organizations for everyone like Greek Life, Diversity Organizations, Community Services, and Art Clubs. The professors at school are interactive with assignments and help with research projects and internships. My experience helped me land an internship in psychology in my sophomore year of school at an ABA clinic."
Niche User,5,I've went to visit oakland university and its a great place to be .It seems like every students enjoys going there and the surroundings make you feel like home.
Senior,5,The support I receive from my academic advisors and professors is really encouraging and sets you on the right path. I feel like they want me to be successful and are willing to help me in any way to achieve that.
Senior,5,Oakland University is amazing. The student involvement is wonderful and so supportive. All my professors have been nothing but caring and sincere my whole college career. I would recommend OU to any student looking for an awesome college!
Sophomore,5,"Thought I was going to hate it here but, it's been such an amazing experience being here. The Professors are so amazing and kind, and if you don't understand they really don't mind helping!"
Graduate Student,5,Oakland's medical school has some excellent professors who care about their students' success.  It is an excellent option for students that want to stay in the Detroit area while receiving a world-class education.
Niche User,5,"The bottom line of why I enjoy OU so much is that there is not one person I have met that has not given me a welcome feeling. Everyone here cares about me, everyone I have met is nice to me, and does whatever they can to help me out. Other universities I visited were not the same way, often treating me as one of the thousands of people they have at the University. I felt like I was home at OU, as well as feeling cared for, which is a great thing to have at the college level."
Niche User,5,"I liked the people there, the programs, and the campus and Oakland University 
Community service has helped me grow as an individual because it made me want to help others more often. I think helping to volunteer to help others is a very self rewarding things because I personally think it makes you feel better to help others. You can help others in a lot of ways like  helping young kids. I have volunteered to read to younger kids. The happiness and excitement i"
Freshman,5,"Stepping onto campus just feels like home. I enjoy classes, the campus, the activities, sporting events and the friends I've made on campus. There are a lot of opportunities no matter what field you're in. I am currently in the honors college as well as the business honors program. Both are very doable. The only thing I would change is the parking. Since OU is still a commuter school, it is sometimes very difficult to find parking. I do recommend living on campus though."
Alum,5,"I loved the smaller campus life and the convenience of the location. It gave me the feel of going to college, but not going away to school. The parking there is crazy though! You might need to leave early just to find a spot or have enough time to walk to class from where you do park."
Senior,5,"As a senior, OU has changed ALOT in the last 3 years! They've expanded and made more study areas which has been incredible. I loved my major, advisers, and everyone in my classes were always kind. It was always ""we're all in this together"" attitude, ESPECIALLY in labs! I made all my friends in those classes. As someone who is attending grad school after OU, they really prepare us for the rigorousness of that. Also, theres tons of free stuff on campus. Not much of a party area though, i commuted so i cant really comment on how the dorms are but i heard the honors college housing is incredible. I wish OU would expand their graduate programs since they have a medical school maybe they should open up a dental school! I would love that. Only downsides are the math department but when i took calculus in 2019 it wasnt that bad i was able to pass with a B. Overall i've love my experience and i will be a proud alumni."
Freshman,5,The Campus is really beautiful and everyone is really accepting of individuals who are different and accommodate those who need help really well
Senior,5,I really enjoyed the extra help/special services they offered for all their classes and the writing center. Being able to easily make friends in the classes made the days goes by a little faster and definitely made everything easier. The student welcoming get together really brings everyone together and allows for you to view all of the wonderful programs that Oakland has to offer. The people on campus are so helpful and are willing to go out of their way to help you. The professors are very reliable and understanding and truly appreciate their jobs. You can definitely tell that they care about you and how well you're doing in the class as long as the effort on your part is there.
Junior,5,"I love Oakland University and the environment for its students and staff. I am a Junior and have worked two jobs there. I am in the business school. I have the chance to take a wide range of interesting classes, both inside and outside my major. I also get infinite opportunities to look at different majors.  I love living on campus and being provided with so many work opportunities. I have met many great people, had terrific experiences, and an overall wonderful time. I have lived in multiple on campus dorms, all have been great. I am just starting my second job at Oakland University, loving it more by the day."
Sophomore,5,So far my college experience has been one of the bitter sweet. I've liked most of it but not so much the dorm experiences.
Sophomore,5,Oakland University is a great school.  It's a community that is hiding in plain site.  Being a commuter and growing up in the area I had never realized how great the school was before went to it.  It's a great mix between high level academics and competitive sports.  I wouldn't want to go to any other school.
Junior,5,"Oakland University is a place of unique community and acceptance. Over the past two years I have come to truly think of it as a home away from home. The professors are devoted to their students and want them to succeed. In my Cinema Studies major, especially, the smaller class sizes allow for a more personal and invested professor to student experience. I have been given incredible opportunities to gain hands on experience in my chosen field through the program. Campus life is fun and inviting; I have never been to a campus that felt more inclusive than Oakland University. There are a lot of on campus job opportunities that offer experience and for me personally, help me see the university in a new light. Working and going to school at Oakland University has been the best decision I have made in regard to paving the right path to the future I want to achieve. It's a devoted school, close to home in more ways than one. I am proud to be a Golden Grizzly."
Freshman,5,What I like about my experience at Oakland University is the push to put yourself out there more and be more social. In high school I was more shy and reserved but going to Oakland really helped me get outside of my shell that I was in. Especially in the academic department where I find more of myself in the things I was learning I found more things that I was interested in and that helped me look towards my future career.
Senior,5,"I love how one-on-one my classes can be and the environment is so beautiful. I have loved my past three years here, and I'm so excited to graduate and be a proud alum."
Junior,5,"I love everything about OU. When I first decided to attend OU I was honestly frightened. I didn't have any friends that were attending, they were all moving elsewhere. My first year on campus really set the standard for me. Everyone is super nice and willing to help you with anything at any time.  I dont regret my decision at all."
Freshman,5,"I come from a very small faith based private school, and I graduated in a class with under 90 students. I was nervous about enrolling in such a huge school and thought it would be a drastic change from the tight knit school I was used to, well I was wrong. Oakland University has made me feel welcome, and has always willingly helped me with any problems or questions, it is as if we were family. I truly believe Oakland University cares about their students and I'm happy to be apart of school that is so active in the students campus life."
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year, and I can say that it was a very adventurous year. Filled with new friends, mentors, scenery , and education."
Freshman,5,"The staff there are very kind and welcoming, academic wise very good, and professors are amazing and very helpful, campus life is beautiful especially because it is located in a very nice area with beautiful sunsets."
Senior,4,"All of my classes last semester were moved online due to COVID-19. The professors and all staff throughout the university were accommodating. My professors had live lectures, recorded powerpoints, and online office hours in order to teach the concepts and answer anyone's questions. Advisers had online meetings to discuss any questions regarding classes, scheduling, etc."
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed attending Oakland University,  because they really try to get everyone involved in clubs, sports, and other organizations since it is mainly a commuter school."
Freshman,4,"I loved the atmosphere at Oakland University. Everyone is super likable and friendly, even the teachers were interactive and willing to help."
Junior,4,Oakland University gets everyone involved with fun activities on campus. They care about their students future and have different programs to get them ready for a real job.
Junior,4,"The online classes depend on what professor you have. Some are better than others, but overall the classes were better because students can do school work when they want and learn when they want also."
Niche User,4,Online leaning with Oakland was amazing and I had an amazing time enjoying everything that happened daily I would recommend applying if it's something for you
Niche User,4,Campus looked great should apply the diversity was amazing there was so many new faces almost everyday very friendly campus.
Sophomore,4,"Oakland University has a very homely environment and a beautiful campus! As a student who stays on campus I love the amenities and the ability to wake up and go to class on a campus small enough to be comfortable but big enough to be exciting. My teachers have all been excited and ready to help me learn and I've never had any bad experiences when it comes to the different departments. The biggest thing I have an issue with is Grahm Health Center. Their health clinic on campus is perfect for small woes but isn't a place one should seek support in when it comes to mental issues. Their staff is nice and all but the place feels off and they don't treat you if you have been clinically diagnosed with pretty much anything. They'll quickly refer you somewhere else. However, I have had a great experience with Oakland University and I am proud to call myself a Golden Grizzly!"
Sophomore,4,All my classes turned to online in the spring and next fall they will all be online. There is some extra work to be put in but it is almost the same as actually being in class.
Sophomore,4,"Professors are nice, online classes were successful, online website is very helpful. In class learning is helpful and supportive."
Sophomore,4,I like the effort of the university trying to make you feel at home on the campus also in the dorms not much really needs to change at Oakland I like the way it is now just takes a lot of money to attend like some other colleges
Junior,4,"I am a music major, so the online experience was robust. I will say that most of my professors were very understanding and wanted what was best for us. They were willing to meet outside of class to help and before. They genuinely care for us."
Alum,4,"The online classes and online student resources were very streamlined and user friendly. I do think you tend get more out of in-person class, so I would suggest limiting the number of online classes you take and/or reserving the online format for elective courses."
Senior,4,"I have intentionally taken only a few online classes at OU, however, due to COVID-19 all of my classes finished the semester online during the Winter semester of 2020. I have found that the professors who run online classes do their best to communicate and keep a connection not only between themselves and students but among students as a classroom community! There are many resources from professors and OU that are helpful with online learning and in my experience, my professors have been more than willing to meet for in-person office hours as need be!"
Junior,4,"Overall, I appreciate the bonds that I have made with other students on campus. Aside from the atmosphere as a whole, the campus is very convenient/easy to get around, classes are enjoyable and professors are mostly excellent at helping students succeed."
Junior,4,Due to COVID-19 I have had to both finish my classes online and take some completely online over the summer. Oakland University is very well adapt to student success when it comes to making online courses comprehendible.
Niche User,4,IDK jsdhbcdc wehdeiuwhdjeshdeliwudbufewgfuwhjdsbbsjdnewydgshbjnedctgvhbedchjbsdjknwjdkncjkdcnejecniro
Junior,4,"With classes being cut short this past semester, professors had to change their platforms and switch online. I had never taken an online course previously, so this was a major change to have four classes online. My professors made it very easy to do my homework and allowed me the help I needed if I had difficulties."
Alum,4,"I loved taking classes online here. It allowed a lot of flexibility in my schedule, but I don’t think online classes at Oakland were  any better or worse than online classes at other universities"
Sophomore,4,Everyone was forced to switch to online classes once quarantine began and it was definitely tough but all my professors were very understanding and considerate and tried their best to help which made everything a lot easier.
Junior,4,"Oakland University is a great place to expand your knowledge and discover what you would like to do with your future career. The campus community is a great one to be apart of, as you will meet a lot of awesome people here! The staff and professors are excellent here due to how most of them take a genuine interest in you. I have quite a few of professors that have helped me out a lot, in both the classroom and in life. My experience in the dorms was awesome, but it depends on which building you get placed in as there are some older dorms that aren't as nice as the one I stayed in. The atmosphere of the dorms was very friendly and welcoming, and I have met some of my best friends in the dorms at Oakland University! There is not a lot of partying going on at Oakland, so if that is what you are looking for I wouldn't recommend this university. That being said, I have met so many people that have values that mirror mine and have led to friendships that will last for my whole life!"
Junior,4,I'm only a junior so I haven't completed my experience. The campus is beautiful. There are many opportunities to become involved in fraternities/sororities or clubs. The math department isn't the greatest and I recommend taking your math courses at your community college
Freshman,4,"Oakland has been great, and I definitely recommend the college for others looking for a small campus life! It is a tight-knit community and professors really help students."
Junior,4,The Oakland University campus is relatively large and many buildings are newly renovated. The campus is clean and I always feel safe. The staff is friendly and there are many clubs and access to resources for students.
Freshman,4,"The staff all have pretty basic lecturing teaching techniques; although, they are always willing to give extra help as needed. In addition, their tutoring center is a great addition and super helpful. The campus is absolutely beautiful and they love to get students involved."
Niche User,4,"I have not attended Oakland yet, but it is my school of choice. Oakland is a fee-free school which means that having a car on campus is no cost and using their laundry services is free as well. Oakland has a great vibe from what I noticed visiting. The library is open 24/7 with cubbies with TV's that connect to computers and dry erase walls for study groups. It is all about the little things :)"
Senior,4,"I have been an undergraduate student at Oakland University (OU) for 5 years, with a major in Psychology minor in Sociology. I have had both ups and down at OU, as I started with a major in Accounting which had very few applicable classes for my end choice of a Psychology BA, resulting in adding an extra year before graduating. On the contrary, I have made strong friendships and a network with both graduate students and professors from OU and other university through the research lab I joined in 2018. I joined the lab to get hands on experience for graduate school and got that along with a strong network of professors, students, and clinicians. I have become the manager of the lab, run the labs in-person study, published a manuscript, and presented my research and other members research at national conferences such as Meeting of Minds and the American Psychological Associations."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I love it. Home-like campus, decent food, amazing professors. I haven't had a bad professor yet. I connect with people on campus often. There are plenty of things to do off campus as well. I would strongly recommend keeping Oakland in mind when choosing a college. I know people who didn't choose Oakland first, but it grew on them. Trust me It's a great place."
Junior,4,"I can say I have enjoyed going to Oakland. Not a big party school or anything, but I'm a chill person so that works for me. I'm a student-athlete so by default I am already apart of an organization, but for traditional students there are a number of ways to get involved on campus through a number of organizations. The academics for me have generally been very good. I am a nursing student, and Oakland has one of the top nursing programs in the country. Thus, with my classes being mostly nursing classes, I have nursing school professors, and so these professors are very good."
Junior,4,I enjoy the professors at this university. I haven't had a professor yet that isn't interested in their student's success. They have always made themselves available and teach in a very detailed manner.
Freshman,4,"Oakland University’s campus is not too large and has great food, they also have good professors. One thing I want them to improve are the dorms."
Sophomore,4,I transferred here from a private college in western Michigan.  Oakland offers diverse subject matters and a wide variety of classes.  Professors are very helpful and well-versed in subject matter.  Many student organizations.  Campus is well-kept.
Junior,4,"I like the professors, they care about their students. The only issue I have is staff not giving clear information on confusing things like meal plans, Chartwells couldn't tell me much about their own meal plans and housing just directed me to the website which is also confusing. If I wasn't looking for housing and meal plans it would be 5 stars!"
Senior,4,I love Oakland University. The faculty and students all really care about the university and the campus life is thriving.
Freshman,4,I really like the small class sizes and easy to navigate campus at OU. So far the transition from high school to college has been pretty easy thanks to my professors.
Sophomore,4,"This is my second year living on campus at Oakland University. I love living in Oakview Hall, it is a very nice dorm. I have had professors that know what they teach very well, and are generally reliable. I feel safe on campus and there are many services available for students."
Freshman,4,the advisors here are great the professors are okay. the food is awesome i honestly love this school they make you feel important and cared for
Freshman,4,"I knew that I wanted to go to Oakland University the day I step foot on the Campus for a visit. I love all of my professors on Campus. They are all so help, and not scary. I had attended class at Mid Michigan Community College in high school, through a dual-enrollment program and I fell the Professor at Oakland are so much better. I also feel there is lots of great Opportunities for students to learn more then just in the class rooms. For example there was just a program called, ""Ask Orah"" Last week that I had just sent to. That gave a chance to hear more about the College and more educated topics form the President of the United Stated. Now a little bit off the topic of Education. I feel that Oakland University has Wonderfull building and Campus living. All of the dorms have updated spaces and feel very safe. Never once has I ever felt unsafe on campus. They make sure all students are protected with a night watch program"
Sophomore,4,Oakland is a pretty nice school. Some downsides is that the math department is pretty terrible. Many students do struggle because of the structure and teaching style. If your major includes a lot of math it may be smart to take those math classes at any community college. Besides the math all of the other classes have been fine.
Freshman,4,"Oakland University is a public research university in Auburn Hills and Rochester Hills, Michigan.Its a incredible place to be."
Freshman,4,All the professors are very personable. Also the campus itself is beautiful and very easy to navigate. The price is very good and scholarships are reasonably easy to acquire.
Graduate Student,4,I attended Oakland my first two years of school and am already admitted for grad school in the winter semester. It has a fantastic campus life for residents and commuters. Oakland has amazing and helpful professors that stir you in the right direction for success in your career. I am so thankful and blessed to continue my education in graduate school at this magnificent university!
Junior,4,"I like that they have great career opportunities available once you earn you degree. They offer several internship programs and they have unlimited scholarships. They have other campuses where you can take your courses instead of just one campus. Also, they offer online courses and they have advisers to assist and help you every step of the way. They try their best to assist students with financial aid issues and they are really persistent with having students start on time. They are really helpful and they provide the tools that are needed to help the students be successful.  I would definitely recommend this school."
Senior,4,Great school. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The only negative thing about the school is that the financial aid sucks.
Junior,4,"The professor really make an impact on expanding your knowledge, and making you feel comfortable in there learning environment."
Senior,4,I like the class schedule they have a variety of classes to help suit your career and be able to work as well. The professors have good work ethics and go beyond to help each student who require help. School is located in great area with a beautiful school setting. I will recommend this school to everybody.
Freshman,4,"Oakland University is a fun university with a beautiful campus and good people. It is easy to get plugged in and find good resources, both from the university and from your peers. Overall, the classes are decent and many of the professors are easy to work with. The only downfall is the lack of a party scene. There are  no parties on campus, which means you have to know somebody to get into a party off campus. Overall, Oakland University is a good, albeit quiet school."
Sophomore,4,"I give them good ratings because everything seems to go well except for the financial aid office. I am struggling to return because of miscommunication on their behalf and no forgiveness or understanding on personal situations that make financing more of an issue than they need to be. I'm afraid every other college is like this, however; Oakland gave me the most money in the first place. I can only assume their staff is incompetent or not trained for ""non-textbook""questions."
Senior,4,"A great college, especially for commuters. There's a very involved campus life with events happening constantly for any group around campus. Not too diverse; but where there is a lack thereof, student organizations use whatever they can to educate those not particularly aware."
Junior,4,Oakland university is a beautiful campus and a great place to be.  The staff is great and it is such a diverse campus.  I would recommend being apart of the grizzly experience and attend
Sophomore,4,"Oakland is a wonderful college with great academics and decent housing and meal plans. However, it’s a heavily commuter school, so unfortunately weekend life is non existent, almost everyone goes home leaving campus dead and boring. The campus is extremely safe and the surrounding areas are not lacking in things to do!"
Alum,4,"The campus is absolutely stunning after many renovations and additions. Although tuition is on the rise, the quality of the campus itself is as well. Class time options are one of the greatest assets as Oakland University id a commuter school, so having more options for days and times of classes, especially general education classes, is fantastic. Though some may not like the commuter school feel, there are an array of campus activities at all times of the day that make Oakland University feel like a big school."
Freshman,4,"I love the overall atmosphere of Oakland University because of the smaller campus and the accessibility of everything on campus. I also love the diversity of students there and I have found that everyone who attends is super friendly and makes one another feel comfortable. I started school in January was was pleased at the maintenance such as the parking lots always being plowed early in the morning and all of the sidewalks being adequately salted and shoveled to prevent unsafe travel to and from classes. What I would like to be changed at OU are some of the professors who are noticeably unhappy with their teaching positions and that greatly affects their teaching in lectures. I would not change anything else about Oakland University because overall it is a great small to medium sized school, easily reachable by many, and provides students with a diverse and great college."
Freshman,4,"Small but nice, open campus. It is home to one of the few Chick fil' A's in Michigan. The campus itself is constantly being renovated in the summer in order to improve the experience one would feel at Oakland University. Parking is a huge issue with this university unfortunately."
Junior,4,"I enjoy attending Oakland University. It is a great commuter school and easy to get involved. With joining clubs and attending classes, I have made great friendships. The professors are caring and helpful. There are usually multiple classes to choose from with different times and professors."
Sophomore,4,"This school is good if your looking for a small classroom environment. Most classes and professors are easy. Harder classes come with supplemental instruction classes to help you understand. The school is located near many businesses so you can easily find a job or internship. The party life is nonexistent but, students are social on campus."
Junior,4,I love Oakland. Everyone on staff is very nice and caring. The students are super great and I have made a lot of good friends. The professors are super great and they care about their students.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy this school; the students are all very kind and the academics are great. However, the parking on campus is less than ideal."
Junior,4,"My time at Oakland University was very enriching and fun. I made many friends as everyone was friendly and willing to help on campus. The campus is clean and small. To walk across the entire campus it takes about 15 minutes. I would prefer a bit more diversity on campus but it isn't a deal breaker for me. Though it is easy to make friends, because Oakland is a commuter school, many of the events on campus are lacking."
Freshman,4,They're application process is very easy and they respond very quickly. They have two brand new dorm buildings and are working on renovating many of the classrooms. It is a commuter school being turned into a full scale university.
Freshman,2,"I am taking online classes over the Fall semester 2020, the professors seem to be nice but as a freshman, you're nervous about everything. Taking online classes is not an easy task financially or educationally. Financially, because they all require a brand new textbook. Educationally, because its hard understanding complex subjects online."
Sophomore,2,"If you need to take mult math classes (engineering), this is NOT the school for you. Their failure rate and caring about it is abysmal. The math dept claims their 50% failure is avg among other schools but see here is the spin. My Calc 2 class started with 60+ students. The first month saw a drop to 30 students. By the last day to drop classes there were 12 students left. I dropped that day with a 20%, yes 20% in the class. I had years of advanced math and scored a 4 on Calc 1 AP. I looked later and there were only 6 students left in the class. So with a 50% failure rate (OU only counts those that finish the class), that means a total of 3 students passed out of 60+ that started the class.  That is over a 95% fail rate. I retook the class at OCC and passed without a problem."
Sophomore,2,"Oakland turned out to be so disappointing for me. There is ZERO social life. Poor Greek life, no parties, and no college town. Oakland is treated by many as a community college and many students are just local kids from Macomb and Oakland county. The business program is very bare bones and has terrible resources. I would only go to Oakland if you feel you are not ready for college and need a place with little distractions."
Sophomore,2,Extremely boring and some professors are good while others are absolutely terrible. The fellow students were boring as well.
Junior,2,"Oakland is a good school if you want to get a good return on investment, and you don't mind not having a big social life. Most of my professors are really good, and a few just kind of expect you to just know the material. A lot of commuters go there and there isn't affordable housing nearby. I know a few people who hang around campus, but most people study and go home or work. The parking is pretty bad with all the commuters too, so plan on looking for a parking spot every day. There is little to no party scene and no football team to watch which either. The local area is mostly wealthy suburbs, so the area is really boring and expensive."
Sophomore,2,"Oakland University as in terms of location is in a beautiful place, but the college overall is decent at best. The academics are god awful just from being in a business program I have to take all kinds of classes that don't pertain to my major, and even though this is common among all colleges. Oakland takes it one step further by making sure those classes that don't relate are difficult, and you are more than likely going to fail it and you are going to have to retake it. Although there are some great professors at Oakland the majority of professors I have had are unwilling to help, cocky and rude they love to tell you that they have a masters degree or a doctoral degree. The overall student body just seems depressed and anti-social. Personally, I think Oakland is an ok college with decent reputation in the metro-Detroit area but other than that it's virtually unknown so if you want a reputable degree that will work outside the metro-Detroit area then Oakland is not your college."
College Freshman,2,The party scene is very limited. There are fun events you can go to during the evening with lots of people but I wouldn't call them parties. If you want a party you're not entirely out of luck. Get into a greek organization or get into a social circle that parties. Not many large scale parties happen.
College Freshman,2,If you want to party your going to have to work hard to find one. Greek life helps. If you're underage you'll have to throw your own get together with friends or get upper classman friends who party.
College Freshman,2,"I have had one professor who had policies solely revolving around minimizing his own work load, he didn't speak loud enough to be heard past the second row (of 10), and he looked like he hated his job. Another professor had recently come from teaching high school and treated the class like children. I've also had an equal amount of decent professors and a few great ones. However I don't think a 50/50 good to bad ratio is acceptable"
College Junior,2,There's not a lot of involvement and they tend to only be friends with other Greeks
College Sophomore,2,We don't have much spirit.
College Sophomore,2,"Unheard of, to me and my friends, and I do not see the impact they have on our school/society."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not pay much attention to athletics, but I'm sure others in my college do. They do not seem to be a large part of college life."
College Sophomore,2,"Parties are not abundant, from what I see, but people seem to be happy with them when they do occur. I do not see many clubs in the surrounding areas, but do know of a popular bar where the older students hang out occasionally (Red Ox). Underage nightlife is probably prevalent, but I don't go out so I don't know much about it. I am slightly disappointed with the lack of transportation at night--that is dangerous for students who have night classes (especially who have to walk across campus back to the dorms or to a far parking lot)."
Recent Alumnus,2,I am not a fan of the campus housing and glad I do not live on campus
College Freshman,2,I don't know anything about this.
College Freshman,2,"Oakland University is a commuter school, so the party scene is pretty much absent."
College Freshman,2,"Not many people stay after they finish classes, so not too much happens."
College Senior,2,Greek life is not a big part of OU. I think this is because many students live at home and there is not a large street of sorority houses. The sorority houses that I have seen are small and slightly run down. OU is also not big on parties so that also hampers greek life.
College Senior,2,Athletics are not a big part of OU. The only thing people even sometimes pay attention to is basketball. There is not even a football team here.
College Senior,2,There is only one fraternity and one sorority for all of campus and they have no housing.
College Sophomore,2,"No parking, financial services are terrible, awful food in vandy"
College Freshman,2,"It's really boring and I regret coming here. No one has any type of school spirit, the dining food is gross, and no one lives on campus. Overall, this is an awful college experience and I plan to transfer in the fall."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are very old and need to be remodeled. There is a new building that was recently built called Oak View Hall and it has air conditioning, personal bathrooms, a microwave, refrigerator, sink, and cupboards in the rooms."
College Freshman,2,"Oakland University is primarily a commuter school meaning students aren't involved in campus activities. There's no social scene or school spirit and a lot of people keep to themselves. There's never any parking spaces and the food served in the cafeteria is gross.Overall, this has been an awful college experience and I plan to transfer in the fall."
College Freshman,2,"My experience has been very poor. Classes are too easy, I don't take pride in going here, and the community is not academically stimulating."
College Senior,2,"I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to fill out paperwork. I'll have unsatisfied requirements that I won't know about because I wasn't notified about them. I'm still working on getting all my paperwork turned in and I'm getting frustrated because I am going through a lot of work to get this turned in, and I think they are probably not going to give me much money. I lost almost all of my grants last year. This year, even though I am in need of financial aid, I'm getting the least amount I've ever gotten from them. I wouldn't mind dealing with the paperwork if I actually got a lot in grants and scholarships. But they aren't giving me much!"
College Sophomore,2,"The on campus police and administration are way too strict about keeping the campus a dry campus. Most parties are usually squashed by RAs or police within the frist hour or so that they go on, so if you want to go out, it's usually a hit or a miss."
College Freshman,2,I had a large sum of money taken away from what I had rightfully earned in the financial aid department of OU. The workers made mistakes with W-2's and permanently deleted my chance of earning back the aid I crucially need.
College Freshman,2,"Vandenberg Cafeteria was not very impressive in their range of fresh foods. This year many people got sick and there were rumors that it was from the cafeteria food, but the company did not verify if it was their fault or not. I would often go back to my dorm either hungry or with an upset stomach from the Vandenberg Cafe. However, the Oakland Center's food was a lot better, but the number of meals that we were allowed from the OC were limited to 3 a week, which was an inconvenience."
College Junior,2,"OU's Financial Aid office is not helpful and not empathetic. When they took my scholarship away even though I met the academic requirements for renewal, the lady told me to apply for one of the business school scholarships. I asked her to show me which ones I qualified for, and when she saw I qualified for NONE of them, she said ""that sucks""."
College Sophomore,2,There are so many thungs Oakland University is lacking as far as athletics are concerned. This seriously impacts the level of school spirit on campus.
College Freshman,2,"I can not afford college, so I might have to take a year off. My mother is widowed and she can not afford it. I wish i was rich so I can continue to chase after my dream."
College Freshman,2,"Enforcement isn't that great, many noise complaints are submitted but nothing is done about it. It seems like all the officers care about is giving parking tickets to people who aren't in overnight spots, instead of cracking down on drug and alcohol use."
College Freshman,2,"The only parties here are through fraternity's and sororities, which are organizations that I don't want to be a part of or hang out with,"
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many options at Vandenberg cafeteria, which is the main place to eat, and it's where my meal plan is. Most days there's nothing to eat so I end up wasting a meal there and leaving hungry."
College Freshman,2,Only good place to eat is the OC and students only have three meals there per week.
College Sophomore,2,"they did not work with me to give scholarships.  they were rude and it was such a headache trying to earn a scholarship, even being in the honors college"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The parties will take place in the apartments, but there are rarely any parties on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The food is bad in the cafeteria, but the food court is decent. There is a Subway, Chick-fil-A, and a few others. You can use transfer meals to eat here."
College Freshman,2,"The food is okay but most of time its pretty bad, I eat it because its easy access and I have a meal plan for a reason."
College Freshman,2,"I don't hear much about it, so I don't think it's a very big deal."
College Sophomore,2,There should be more going on outside of the classrooms to help students get ahead in the real world. Internships and volunteer programs should be made more known.
College Sophomore,2,"Oakland lacks that feeling of togetherness. Especially with sports, I wish there was a football team, and a big awesome band, and majorette dancers, the whole nine. Oakland is one step up from a high school to be honest."
College Senior,2,"I considered going greek life, until I saw the girls in one chapter making fun of a girl on my freshman move in day."
Recent Alumnus,2,There really isn't much that goes on
College Freshman,2,The parties always get shut down by the cops !! It's not fun no more! Ugh
College Sophomore,2,They don't give out very much financial aid
College Freshman,2,There is no parties anywhere
College Sophomore,2,I wish there was more student involvement in sports and I wish the college overall placed more importance on sports.
College Junior,2,I feel like that I am not learning anything new or worthwhile in these BSN classes. These RN to BSN classes are just a means to an end so that I can earn my NP.
College Senior,2,"The hours of dining are terrible! There is no where to eat late on campus, and the food is always overpriced. There are some healthful options, but there are few."
College Senior,2,"While there is financial aid available, you are completely on your own with it. The people in the financial aid office are very vague and different people will tell you different things. Also, none of them in the office have any actually doing power to help you. They will always refer you to another source, which is a headache, and it often takes forever to process paperwork. I also know that they have even misplaced some of my paperwork, thus making things late, thus charging me with ridiculous late fees. The late fees have disrupted my class registration too, thus messing up my curriculum at time too. If I wasn't so far in my program, I would most definitely considered transferring just to avoid the mess."
College Junior,2,"I don't care for Oakland's dining service. I hate it. It's not good to me. I would usually go to Subway in the food court. I tried my best to stay out of Vandenberg dining hall. It's good for the freshmen who come in. They have not experienced the food enough, but when you've been there for three years like me you start to see a difference. I always went to the oc to eat where better options were."
College Junior,2,"All of the social scenes on campus are well-maintained, but the social scene on campus does not seem too vibrant."
College Freshman,2,The wifi at OU is one of the biggest complaints students have about the technology.
College Freshman,2,"We don't have a football team, just a club. We have a good basketball team. Oakland is growing."
Recent Alumnus,2,Winters are freezing and summers are hot and humid!
Recent Alumnus,2,"Really expensive and outdated. There are nice apartment complexes in the area, but they're expensive, too."
College Sophomore,2,"Since this started as a commuter school, on campus transporation is still very limited."
Freshman,1,Online is awful. Professors expect a lot out of you. It’s even worse because a lot of professors will force you into groups of people you’ve never met before. You have no way of forcing them to do their work so you just take a bad grade. Avoid online classes at all costs
Sophomore,1,"They were disorganized. I fell through every crack possible, and when I went in to talk to an advisor about it and fix the problems, she coldly reminded me that she is the advisor, and I am the student, implying that I did not have the power to second guess her. I moved schools."
Sophomore,1,"Small, dead commuter school with no parties or any night-life. Hard to meet new interesting people since everybody goes home after 5. Even joining a sorority didn't make campus life more exciting. Sports aren't big on campus and campus dining is sub par. Also Auburn Hills isn't lively and exciting like other college towns. If you want a real college experience. Apply to MSU, U of M and other school. You're better off"
Freshman,1,Oakland does not truly care about its students. Their motto is all about student involvement but if you dont like the way something is run too bad because they wont hear you out to make it right.
Graduate Student,1,"I had a serious issue with a professor being unfair and non responsive towards the end of the semester and I reached out to the dean of the school and even the dean could not help me nor respond. To many professors have that ""im better than you"" attitude. The counselors were all ""pro teachers"" and took the professor side without hearing what really happened. Very unprofessional to not respond to a student. I emailed the professor numerous times and he just felt like not responding... The headline of his syllabus states ""treat this class like a work environment and be professional""  that must not include the professor. I was late for a lot of classes because the parking lot is too small, and was a nightmare. Even in the cafeteria, I had to sit on the ground to eat my lunch because they do not have enough seats and tables for everyone. I passed all my classes and got my degree in four years so im not complaining because I failed, just keeping future students aware."
Sophomore,1,"Honestly, the worst university choice ever. I went to Western for a year and I have  visited many campuses. I have never had to deal with more incompetent professors, the financial aid experience has been a nightmare (it is almost the end of the semester and my tuition is still not paid because of how incompetent this office is), and the campus life is horrible. If you commute, do not plan on making any friends and plan on dealing with a bunch of weirdos that are too scared to move away from their mommies and daddies. The worst school ever. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A MEMORABLE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. I will be transferring at the end of the semester and this is my first semester here."
Freshman,1,"The ceiling was leaking while it was raining. I was 10 minutes early to class, I had set my stuff down and went to the bathroom right across the hall. I slipped and fell and hit my head, things were spinning. I ended up not going to the restroom, and was less than 1 minute late to class. The door was locked and when I explained what happened the professor said I needed a doctor's note and wouldn't even let me get me things out of the classroom. Most professors at Oakland are like this. It sucked."
College Sophomore,1,"If you are looking to party, do not come to Oakland."
College Sophomore,1,"Disabled students are treated harshly. Faculty and staff call out both minorities and people with disabilities, asking invasive questions that are none of their business. I have been in classes where professors single out students of minority religions or ethnicities in front of their peers - even in classes where it isn't relevant to the class topic. Staff in Financial Services calls out students with disabilities that seek financial advice."
College Sophomore,1,"There are emergency phone booths all around campus. However, students still receive at least one e-mail alert from OU Police Department every month stating that there has been an alleged physical or sexual assault on campus (usually in the apartment complexes or near the library)."
College Sophomore,1,"WARNING: DO NOT ATTEND THIS SCHOOL - ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE OUT OF STATE!! My name is Kaitlyn McCandliss. Oakland University promised me a full-ride academic scholarship. I moved here from Missouri. I never would have moved here if I had known what OU would do to me. THEY TOOK AWAY MY SCHOLARSHIPS on move-in day! I was left with nowhere to live! When I fought for my scholarships in a civil manner, mind you- the faculty at Financial Aid treated me with absolute disrespect. They told me that they had already awarded my financial aid to someone else! Later, I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease. I was becoming completely disabled. Before dropping any courses, I spoke with Financial Aid Representative Glen and other faculty at Financial Services, and with the Dean of Students. They told me that I could reduce my course load or drop all of my classes, and that, after reducing my course load, I spoke with the Director of Financial Aid. She confirmed that I could appeal. They told me that once I was well again, I could appeal for my scholarships back, and that if I had sufficient documentation, that my appeal would be approved. After undergoing treatment, I submitted an appeal. Monica at Financial Aid informed me that I AM NOT ALLOWED TO APPEAL!!! Apparently, I became disabled over winter break. I should have become disabled during the semester, if I wanted my appeal to work. That is absolutely ridiculous!!!!"
College Sophomore,1,Nursing school is filled with prissy sorority girls.
College Sophomore,1,I really don't care enough about sports and athletics.
College Freshman,1,"No one cares about Greek life here. They try to make this a ""party"" school by hosting events but it's not going to happen."
College Sophomore,1,There are barely any parties here.
College Freshman,1,Not much happens at Oakland party-wise. I kind of like the quiet though and there are other fun things to do than go to parties.
College Freshman,1,We do not really have parties here at all.
College Freshman,1,Lots of people get food poisoning
College Freshman,1,The police is quick to get to the scene and break up a party. The parties are sometimes fun. It annoying if they are in a persons apartment because of the size of it.
College Junior,1,"It was a horrible experience. I was denied financial aid because my parents ""make too much""; if they made too much I wouldn't be asking for it in the first place. This is a problem because it is stopping me from taking the classes I need."
College Sophomore,1,"the police strictness on parking is unbelievable. Everyone knows parking is hard on campus, so why is there even debate on students parking in certain areas overnight? We aren't killing people, raping people, assaulting anyone, we just want to park overnight."
College Sophomore,1,If colleges are supposed to assist in off campus housing this one doesn't.
College Freshman,1,"I say it's the worse because There's always a form that's needed and then you worry about if you financial aid cover everything! If it doesn't cover, you will have to take out a loan."
College Freshman,1,I have heard a lot of bad views about it from a lot of freshmen
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing makes this school unique, and it is a terrible experience to have to go here. This place sucks and has to be one of the worst universities in the nation."
College Sophomore,1,"A degree from here has little value, and the career prospects after graduation are extremely slim."
College Sophomore,1,Choosing to attend college at Oakland University was the worst decision I have made in my life.
College Sophomore,1,"The facilities are undersized, overused, cheaply built, and run-down."
College Sophomore,1,"The professors here are unprofessional and under qualified, and this makes it extremely difficult to get anything useful out of virtually every class."
College Sophomore,1,"Majors hardly vary in terms of required classes, and the workload is extreme and difficult along with professors who are unknowledgeable and unwilling to help."
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone has a horrible, stuck-up attitude, and no one is willing to get to know you or help you with anything."
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone here seems to be of the same background, rarely is anyone considered different. This place is almost full of stuck-up rich kids who live off of their parents."
College Sophomore,1,"This campus is pretty much totally unsafe, and students get robbed and sexually assaulted very often."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is not fit for human consumption, and the cooks are mentally ill and have no knowledge of cooking."
College Sophomore,1,"I do not enjoy it, as the classes you advisor makes you take are complete jokes along with the unqualified professors who teach them."
College Sophomore,1,"Extremely limited options, high prices, and low quality."
College Sophomore,1,"Not many options available on a college budget. On-campus housing is over capacity, and students who do not receive a spot on-campus are hung out to dry by the housing office, which is a joke and run by morons."
College Sophomore,1,"Drugs and substance abuse run rampant here, and the social scene is dangerous and unenjoyable. There are rarely ever any parties, and the few that do take place are small and uneventful, except for the heavy drug use that usually takes place."
College Sophomore,1,"I cannot stress this enough. THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE HERE IS A JOKE. They take 3 weeks to give you an answer on even the smallest question, and when they do, only more questions arise. The imbeciles who work here should all be fired immediately. The workers here have zero care in the world for the concerns and questions of students."
College Sophomore,1,"Horrible selection in majors, and the classes required to get them hardly differ from each other."
College Sophomore,1,"Extremely difficult as the professors expect you to perform miracles for them in order to get anywhere. I learned nothing but had to work extremely hard, and barely got anywhere even with good grades."
College Sophomore,1,"Small and undersized, and the 10 kids that actually do participate in it are complete snobs and treat the non-members like peasants."
College Sophomore,1,"The police officers here treat the students like criminals, and slap you with a parking ticket on move-in day if you are even remotely parked illegally. Good luck."
College Sophomore,1,The housing department is a complete and utter joke. Their setup and system is complete garbage. The residence halls are old and worn out and need replaced ASAP. The people working in the housing department do absolutely nothing to help out if you need assistance or have questions.
College Sophomore,1,"Bad, run-down part of town. Not anything worth seeing or going to as far as activities and attractions go."
College Sophomore,1,"No one ever pays attention to any of the sports, and rightfully so as they all suck anyway."
College Senior,1,"The University provides no help with off campus housing. If you want to live off campus, you're on your own. You better hope you have your own car to get there, for there isn't any decent public transportation. The costs aren't really that affordable for the average college student, especially if you want to live alone, it's near impossible to find a place affordable. The town is pretty residential, not suitable for cheap college living."
College Sophomore,1,Doesn't seem to be any strickness
College Sophomore,1,This has been the worst winter ever and the campus is not kept clear of snow for walking or parking
College Sophomore,1,I was stuck in a snow ridden temporary lot at 11pm when I returned from work and called campus police and it took over an hour for help and several calls and I was all alone
College Freshman,1,It makes the school day way less enjoyable.
College Freshman,1,Walking in the snow is horrible!
College Junior,1,"Unfortunatelly, I cannot ever find a spot and the distance is so far from the buildings!"
College Sophomore,1,I received a little financial aid at first but was not told i had to renew it and they took it away from me and left me with nothing.
College Sophomore,1,"The sciences are extremely hard and there are a lot of teachers who are hard to understand.
The OC is the biggest ""hangout"" area in our school and is always over-crowded with no seats available"
College Freshman,1,"The staff in the weight room at the rec center are BEYOND RUDE. I got threatened to be removed from the facilities because I was wearing spandex shorts, which I see other girls wear all the time.  I believe they're discriminating against me because I'm the only female in there lifting big weights.  I've been yelled at every single day for stupid things and they all watch me like I'm their child.  I felt uncomfortable, and when I was told if I ""disobey"" the dress code again that I would not be allowed to come in anymore, I just told them I wouldn't be coming any more.  Super SEXIST,  and none of the staff know a thing about fitness at all. DO NOT GO HERE. Get a gym membership or buy your own equipment. They also don't let you use chalk and there isn't nearly enough strength training equipment, but they have a billion treadmills.  Seems like a wannabe Planet Fitness to me."
College Freshman,1,"This is the main reason most people don't get the ""college experience"" at this university. There is no college experience. The university is only concerned with academics and it really has a toll on the students. There's no where for any students to go to unwind and relax and relieve stress. It's pretty upsetting."
College Freshman,1,"There is no ""off campus"" parking. The university and police work together to ticket any student that parks in a restaurant lot, since there is no designated ""off campus"" parking. Tickets are also pretty average, unless they catch you going 5mph over, which will cost almost $100. "
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing to do at night on or around campus unless you're over 21, and even then it's pretty sad. There are no parties, the clubs are expensive, and the campus security, as well as off campus police, are always on top of parties. No one is even near campus when they don't have to be. The campus is pretty dead during the weekends. There isn't much fun to be had."
College Freshman,1,"We're not allowed to park off-campus for obvious reasons i.e. businesses complaining. You have to arrive really early if you're a commuter because you probably won't get a spot if you arrive later than eleven or noon. There are a few temporary parking lots, but they're really far and I have classes all over campus and there still isn't enough parking, even with the temporary lots."

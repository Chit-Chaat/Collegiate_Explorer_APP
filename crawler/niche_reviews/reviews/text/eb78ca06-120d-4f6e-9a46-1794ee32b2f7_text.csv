Freshman,4,Everyone is super helpful and attentive to my needs. I love it! I became less scared and more excited to continue on.
Senior,4,Great experience after I took a chance on myself to get active and engage in school activities. I used to stay in the back of the room but I nominated myself for vice president for the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) Club and I was promoted up to President a month later. I was nervous when I took on the responsibilities but it's been a rewarding experience. I know more now than I wouldn't had I not stepped up and nominated myself then took responsibility as president. I meet a lot of new students even if they don't get active in the club activities. I'm looking forward to elections next week! A good experience that I would recommend to others interested in school at SBC.
Freshman,4,So far college has been great for me here at SBC. A lot of hands on help and resources here on campus. I'm also living on campus and the housing is very clean and safe. There are many clubs and tutoring available here also. Only thing I think it could improve on or add to campus is after class activities for students with children here on campus. There is a small fitness or exercise room but not a whole lot to work with in there. Maybe more weights and some type of gym would be great. A outdoor basketball court would be nice. All in all though I am happy and intent here at SBC.
Recent Alumnus,4,I have enjoyed this school so far. very convenient location and friendly students and teachers. The teachers are there to help you in any way to succeed
College Senior,4,The tuition is very reasonable and with scholarships and grants you even get paid to go to school.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many different ways that the school helps you find work. While you're in college, they have a lot of job postings up usually through work study, but also to become a peer tutor. Most of the programs here require you to complete an internship, which helps you out in the long run."
College Sophomore,4,The students here are typically really nice to each other. It's been fun getting to know people here and some of my best friendships were formed here.
College Sophomore,4,"The workload isn't too much. I can get help from my classmates and my teachers if I need to. For my degree plan, it's required to have an internship before I graduate, which will make finding a job in the future easy."
College Sophomore,4,"The academics are good. The teachers push you to do your best, but they don't push you too hard. If you need help they'll be willing to help you out so you can get better grades. The registration process is very easy, and doesn't take too long. If you need help with the registration process, you can ask just about any teacher and they can lead you the right way."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of places to go to, to work on homework."
College Sophomore,4,"Welcoming classmates, easy workload. Cheap tuition"
College Sophomore,4,"The instructors are very helpful and there a few hours after class. They also have a tutoring schedule. Class registration is very easy. You just meet with your advisors and they help you pick out your classes, so that the rest of your years will go by smoothly without any problems. Also, your advisor is the head of the program you are going into, so that is a huge plus."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of computer labs and accessibility to them is good. You can print as much as you would like without having to pay for the papers. The wireless is great, haven't had any difficulties with it. They also have laptops that you can rent for about a week and rerent if there is no one on the waiting list."

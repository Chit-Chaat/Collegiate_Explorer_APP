Alum,5,University of Illinois at Springfield offers incredibly diverse academic and extracurricular opportunities in a close-knit campus community.
Sophomore,5,"I am very happy with my experiences so far at the University of Illinois Springfield. I am part of the Baseball team there. Being a part of the baseball team makes me feel very connected to the university because it is like my family away from home. From my teammates, to the baseball coaches, and the strength coaches I really love this university. Also, all the athletes at this university really become close since it is a smaller setting, so we all get to know each other and become close since we are all similar."
Sophomore,5,"We transitioned to online classes as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic made its way through the country. The transition was very easy and my professors were extremely flexible when it came to this new learning platform. In all honesty, I liked the online classes more than the in-person classes because it was more based around your own schedule. The only downside to transitioning online was the unavoidable difficulties that technology sometimes causes."
Sophomore,5,"I love UIS. From the teacher to student ratio to the tight communities you form, I would choose to come to a small school every time if I were to choose again."
Senior,5,"Awesome, clean friendly campus that has great resources for their students. Offers a variety of activities to choose from"
Sophomore,5,"Well for starters I love the university of illinois at springfield because of its diversity , class size and most of all everyone from peers to staff works with you to help better your college experience and make sure that you are on the right track by being prepared for each and every class."
Freshman,5,"I am going to be attending this Univeristy very soon. The campus looks amazing, and I can not wait to be able to be there."
Alum,5,"Overall, I had an incredible experience attending this school online. I was challenged and given criticism as well as the opportunity to really grow both as a person and in my skill is a writer."
Alum,5,"I loved UIS. However, I wished there were more on campus activities! I would have enjoyed pep rallies, tailgating, a football team, and even sororities and fraternities!"
Senior,5,Great school with amazing professors that are always willing to help. Lots of activities to do on campus!
Senior,5,The school made it easy for me to complete my degree while also working full time. The professors are great and knowledgeable and always willing to help.
Sophomore,5,Amazing! love attending classes and knowing that I am not just a number. I would definitely recommend UIS to any incoming freshmen. They have a very safe campus multiple clubs and activities you can do while you are on a break from homework.
Junior,5,The campus is the most beautiful thing you will ever see. The people here bring everything to life and everyone is just out there trying to be the best version of themselves and you just couldn't asked for a better atmosphere to be around.
Graduate Student,5,There have a wonderful community where they genuinely care about each student and their achievements.
Junior,5,"My counselor has been very helpful, the transfer coordinator has been very supportive and I have loved working with him. The campus is perfect for those who want a high quality small campus. The only issue I have had was they package dependent students' financial aid as living on campus automatically, which I found very annoying because it prolongs you getting a correct award letter because you have to correct them and they have to redo it. I feel like it would be more efficient to just pull the living situation of the student from their FAFSA instead of a blanket policy."
Junior,5,"I would like to have more opportunities for online and part-time students to receive financial assistance from the college.  Several of my friends have struggled with the issues of paying for school, and even had to drop out.  I am not the average high school graduate attending school for her first year, and the campus opportunities for funding just don't exist."
Freshman,5,The people were nice and welcoming. The campus was great and it is a small school. It is nice that the school does a dinner for the incoming freshmen.
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere at UIS, everyone is extremely helpful and friendly! The professors and the support staff help you in ever way they can. The students on campus all say Hi to each other and it's just a very close knit community."
Freshman,5,"Coming from a small town, this smaller college is perfect for me! It isn't too big, nor too small. The community here is so wonderful and accepting! The teachers do their best to make sure everyone understands the material and helps whenever it is needed. Overall, this school is a perfect smaller university!"
Sophomore,5,"I feel like I have so many resources to go to on campus when I need help, and as a student-athlete I find this very important.  If you seek out the help you need, you will succeed here!"
Sophomore,5,"Attending school in Springfield is not bad at all. I enjoy the atmosphere and the peers around me. Very nice school which isn't huge, but just right."
Niche User,5,"As a high school senior, I have lots on my plate when it comes to finding the right college for me. Growing up in the city of Chicago didn’t make it easier because it's so many options for colleges to choose from. I didn't want to go to a big university and be another number, and I didn't want to go to a university that's too small. I was hopeless because I thought I won't find the right college for me. That was until I met an admissions rep for the University of Illinois at Springfield. He introduced me to the amazing school where I know that I can find myself at for the next four maybe six years. Once going to the school I knew that it was just for me. I really loved the gym, it is the best thing on campus in my opinion."
Sophomore,5,"A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible parts (still called ""leaves"") imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles. One glance at it and you hear the voice of another person, perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time ― proof that humans can work magic."
Freshman,5,"It is overall an amazing school where it is easy to have close relationships with friends, professors, and everyone on campus.  The professors really do care and want you to succeed and will help you if you put forth the effort to seek help."
Freshman,5,The university of Illinois at Springfield is a small college. The people are really nice and accepting to all types of people. Also the campus is very diverse. This is good because it allows other students to explore other cultures. This gives that student the opportunity to understand the world a little better.
Freshman,5,"I have loved my experience at UIS! I am a freshman accounting major living on campus. I love the small campus atmosphere. I can get anywhere on campus in about five minutes. You also get a personal relationship with your professors, as they all know you by name. You won't just feel like another number. All the faculty that I've interacted with have been nothing but kind and helpful. I truly feel like everyone at UIS is looking out for my best interest. The only negative I have is that the food options and hours can be limited."
Senior,5,"UIS is an amazing University. The experience you get at this university is what you make it. The school is working to advance in Greek Life, diversity and expanding to meet the needs of the students. No UIS is not perfect but it's perfect for me. This school is small, and quiet. The student life office offers plenty of events to keep students busy and they offer students leadership opportunities that will allow professional growth. The class sizes are small, so you have the opportunity to get the one on one help you need from your teachers. The advisors are friendly, and our Vice Chancellor will add you on Facebook (She likes posts too). IT'S GREAT TO BE A PRAIRIE STAR!"
Niche User,5,When I went there for a visit I enjoyed the tour that was given to me. This is my dream school and they showed me a very good first impression. I intend on attending this school in the fall of 2017
College Junior,5,UIS is constantly having job fairs and sending e-mails about jobs and internships available. I feel like they are invested in helping me get employed after my schooling ends.
College Junior,5,"I am an online student, so I can't speak for the campus life. However, UIS has offered a quality education with a personal touch. I like that my professors care about my success and know me by name. My math teachers are somewhat disengaged, but I assume that would be the case in any university. They are attentive when asked questions, but most expect us to learn the majority of our material from reading the textbook alone."
College Sophomore,5,UIS is great and i have met a lot of wonderful people here.
College Freshman,5,A degree from this school would benefit you a whole lot because its not just from Springfield its from U of I period.
College Freshman,5,It's so much fun living on campus because they have lounges and other places you can go and things you can do.
College Freshman,5,They have a blue crew that attends and cheer at sports events.
College Freshman,5,I would choose the UIS again because it has a postive impact on students and others thats there.
College Freshman,5,Small classes and online academic opportunities allow me to find the best ways to incorporate both school and work in my life.
College Junior,5,As an online student I have loved my classmates and instructors. I have had nothing but positives to say so far
College Junior,5,The online program is great. Advisors are great and there for you when you have any questions.
College Freshman,5,I've felt very safe at this school so far.
College Sophomore,5,One of the reasons I chose UIS was the diversity compared to equal sized private colleges.
College Freshman,5,"I love this school, everything about it is jusgt perfect, people, faculty, wstaff"
College Freshman,5,"Overall, everything went smoothly but with financial aid, getting all your papers together is a hassle but definitely worth it.  Professors are really nice so far so are the students.  The variety of courses is nice and the classes are small enough for you to know you are more than just a number.  I really like UIS so far."
College Sophomore,5,"I am more than happy with the program I am in, which happens to be the Criminal Justice program. I have decided that this is something in which I can really see myself doing in a couple of years or so. Becoming a police officer is the first on my agenda. If the internship with TASC works out than I will hopefully join the organization full-time. I have some concerns being able to actually become a police officer because it's a very competitive occupation and it also isn't the most well-paying job on the market."
College Sophomore,5,This campus is very diverse
College Sophomore,5,I love the CRJ program!!!!!
College Junior,5,"I live in Las Vegas, NV, and compared to the weather in Springfield, my local weather is the best!"
College Junior,5,"  The College of Business and Management has an excellent Faculty comprised of professors that encourage open minded learning of core concepts and practical application of those concepts in a real world environment. The instructors all have real world business experience, and are able to convey that experience to the students in an informative and structured manner. As an online student, as well as someone who brings a number of years of business experience to the classroom myself, I can genuinely appreciate the knowledge and experience of the Faculty."
College Junior,5,"  Professors have firm grasp of course matter, and many have published articles and books on the subjects they teach. All have been open to differing points of view, which is encouraging because everyone is invited to share their individual perspective on topics.The course formats have generally allowed open, active (and many times highly spirited) discussion on current social, political, and economic conditions and policies as they relate to course matters."
College Freshman,5,"UIS is unique because it is a public school with a private school feel. Being a small school, UIS has a very tight knit community, while still remaining to be a public school environment. That is why I love UIS, because the people and the atmosphere is unlike any other."
College Freshman,5,"The computers are good. The availability of both Mac and PC is nice. The Honors students are given a PC laptop to work on and through personal experience I can say it is good. Since I am not in the Honors Program, I have to provide my own computer."
College Junior,5,"Our community is huge in supporting the LGBTQ community, pushing for women's equality, and has a very diverse population.  There are many international students that attend our school and are very accepted.  As for religion, there are organizations that affiliate with Christianity and Catholicism, but there is a lack of any other Eastern religions really.  "
College Junior,5,"Our school is extremely safe.  Being a woman, generally there are a few concerns with walking alone, especially at night.  With the lighting everywhere and an escort service if needed, it makes me feel very secure walking around.  We also have blue poles that are around campus in which you can push a button and campus police will be there within 30 seconds.  "
College Junior,5,"The university is so small that parties are usually non-existent.  If there are any parties, it is usually a few people drinking in their apartment.  As for drugs, there usually is only a few reports of people having them.  "
College Junior,5,The university has very few teaching assistants.  All of my professors are very knowledgeable and are able to teach their specialty extremely well.  The college really pushes the students to be independent by taking charge of their classes and registration for them online.    
College Junior,5,"Our school prides itself on being a very close community.  The classrooms are very small and intimate.  The professors know the students very well.  The school is very prestigious, but at a low cost.   "
College Freshman,5,Campus housing is great and readily available for students.
College Freshman,5,"I would choose this program over and over again, it was a great decision."
College Freshman,5,The campus police are around all the time and respond to calls very quickly.
College Junior,5,"I'd say that the local atmosphere of Springfield, IL is pretty awesome. There are plenty of Abraham Lincoln museums to go to. We have the capital building as well as all of the other aspects of government. The shopping is ok, but compared to the small town I came from, it's a lot more diverse. Springfield is just a beautiful city with a lot of cultural diversity."
College Senior,5,Great Dorms and Awesome off-campus apartments!
Alum,4,"I enjoyed all of my online classes. They were not too cumbersome, but enough o keep be busy and involved. The professors were very structured in what they expected of their students and in the assignments. The online professors. were also helpful and responsive regarding any questions a student may have."
Alum,4,"Online, on-campus, and blended courses at UIS are offered regularly. Faculty use a variety of resources like video lectures and supplemental sources to make the online learning experience diverse and engaging."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the focus given to the students due to the class sizes. Smaller class size for me means that each student can have their individual needs met within the classroom environment. The diversity on campus is one of the best I've seen, and the school does well to be inclusive for students of all kinds from all backgrounds."
Junior,4,"Pros: Great campus and great teachers. All teachers have at least an MD so you won't be taught by a random graduate student who is there just for the credit. The teachers are passionate, class sizes are very small, and people are always willing to help you succeed! The internship programs are really great and opportunitive. There are also unusually no classes on Fridays so always 3-day weekends.

Cons: If you're under 21, live far from home, and have no transportation or money to get it: you probably will be extremely bored. The campus is always quiet and the parties on campus are extremely lame and crowded. Luckily there's a bar everywhere in Springfield, even one right next to campus where every Thursday people go to party which is usually always fun."
Senior,4,"University of Illinois at Springfield is  a great campus for those that want a good education without the craze of huge institutions. The downside is any applications or other paperwork can be incredibly redundant at times. Otherwise facilities are maintained well, the teachers do their best to accommodate all students, and the overall campus is pleasant to live on."
Senior,4,The University of Illinois Springfield has offered me several opportunities to be a successful student. The campus is equipped with all safety resources necessary to feel comfortable on campus at any given time. The campus is also equipped with tools and resources necessary to help me plan and be successful for the future!
Sophomore,4,"Being heavily involved on the college campus has made me experience things that I would have not otherwise experienced without the involvement. Given the involvement, connections have been made through being busy on campus, creating an avenue for grater opportunities both academically and personally."
Sophomore,4,Love the small size classes. It gives me the vibe of a well connected community and a sense of belonging.
Niche User,4,I went on a few trips to visit the campus and it was an overall amazing experience. I had a few questions about diversity programs there and the guide was unable to answer my question. After looking online I found that there is a diversity program and it seems great.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Illinois at Springfield is a great institution. If your looking for a school that's not too big nor too small, then Springfield is the school for you. This school does not have too many distractions so its easy for you to focus on your education. You can make your experience fun through the friendships you create and build with others."
Freshman,4,I have not attended UIS but I had an official visit for tennis in February and I really liked the college and the tennis team. I will definitely be successful and happy at UIS. The campus was beautiful and the personnel was very helpful.
Senior,4,"I am so happy that I chose the University of Illinois at Springfield for my undergraduate degree. The extracurricular activities and living-learning communities that I was involved with provided me with opportunities to not only excel in leadership positions, but to also experience my intended field of work before I began working."
Sophomore,4,UIS has given me many opportunities already in my first two years. I have academic and career plans already set up for me. My academic adviser has helped me figure out what I would like to do after college. My current job has shaped my career path also. I have worked in UIS Admissions for over a year now and I would like to become a college admission counselor. UIS has pushed my academic standing and helped me achieve my academic goals. The small class sizes at UIS fit my learning styles which was one of the reasons why I chose to attend UIS. The campus is small but I like it that way. There are daily events to attend so I don't get bored. Overall I made the right choice decision coming to UIS.
Senior,4,The University has been accommodating for myself as an adult student with a full-time job. The school is not overall great with the availability for a student everything but traditional and is limited on online and night classes.
Sophomore,4,"I love UIS! My overall experience has been good,  there isn't much I would complain about. The instructors and professors form good relationships with their students and actually care about how well they do in the class. Their are many resources around campus to help students do well and be the best student they can be."
Junior,4,I like that it is small. It is very diverse. Residence Life and Financial Aid leave something to be desired.
Senior,4,The teachers I have had have been very honest and open about many things during the class. They provide as much help as they can to everyone and relate to the students. This is part of the computer science program and I have really enjoyed it
Freshman,4,"I enjoy going here it has a friendly student atmosphere, and the CAP professors are accommodating. Despite it being a small school it has a lot of resources due to it being a sister school to the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, when I talk about resources I mean the library resources they have been very helpful to me this past year and I am very grateful for that because I do not know what i would have done if I had not had access to them."
Freshman,4,"This school is very small and even though it might seem like a bad thing at times, it really builds a sense of community. You get to know almost everyone around you and you learn to rely and work with others. However, because it is very small and secluded you might find yourself stuck on campus sometimes. I, however, cannot say that I never have anything to do because I always find something to do on this campus, even if it means just having a picnic with my friends on the quad."
Junior,4,"I love that the campus is small but the town does not have many things for a college student to do. The campus is beautiful and it is definitely growing. In addtion, the small community provides more relationships and opportunities in  for the future."
Junior,4,"I have only been at this school for a semester. I really love all of my professors and that there are several different courses to choose from. The only downfall is that it is very hard to reach people that work there. Unless you have time to o meet them in person, it is pretty much impossible. They are very slow when returning phone calls or emails."
Junior,4,I like that my classes are small and the teacher really get to know who you are. The school staff are friendly and helping with pursuing the main goal degree.
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my experiences with the University of Illinois Springfield and believe that the education I am receiving will be valuable to my career. The institution is a teaching first institution so it is to be expected that the academics will be valued most out of all aspects. I enjoy most of the people that I am surrounded by but the atmosphere could use some help. The environment can be a bit divisive and polarizing at times and is unpleasant to be around. I expect that most colleges and organizations are experiencing this due to the election and current presidency.
Sophomore,4,"Definitely not a perfect school to attend, but it's highly rated for its online classes and it's on the lower end of the price spectrum when it comes to attending school. My professors so far have been diligent and very attentive to my questions, however, I feel they sometimes have unrealistic expectations of students. For instance, a lot of online students have chosen to attend school online because we do not have the time to attend school due to our work schedules. While online school is definitely more flexible than a set class schedule, it's difficult for me to complete my assignments when my professor is asking me to read 200-500 pages a week, watch instructional videos, post in a discussion board, and complete a homework assignment. And that's just one class I'm taking... 
In all, it's a good school, just need to avoid those professors that tend to be a little overzealous with assignments."
Freshman,4,"The campus itself is beautiful until the plants die. That's when you see all the trash people have thrown in them that just sits there forever. The communication skills between students and faculty is horrible. I was placed in the wrong class in June and they waited until the first day of classes to tell me. By then, it was too late to take a different course so I had to drop it."
College Junior,4,UIS admissions advisors help prospective students know what they need to do. Teachers are also proactive in getting to know their students and helping them succeed.
College Junior,4,"Most professors are very knowledgeable in their field. However, some are not superb teachers. I have had a few who were not personable. Most were good though."
College Sophomore,4,Courses are very interesting and class sizes are manageable.
College Freshman,4,The courses are good because they fit what your major is. The professors are cool they have unique personalities.
College Freshman,4,UIS has good security. They had emergency poles that would call or notify the police.
Recent Alumnus,4,I haven't heard of any sexual assaults since I been on this campus. I think this is a pretty safe campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,This school offers so many different programs. Students will receive the top education and hands on help from professors.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Friendliness and diversity is what makes my school unique. I've had a great run here at UIS, faced a bunch of personal, family and financial issues, but I was always encouraged to keep pushing and never give up. My school is very resourceful and willing to help."
College Freshman,4,There seem to be some thriving groups from what I've read in the campus communications.
College Junior,4,UIS has great team spirit and cheering for all seasoned sporting events.
College Freshman,4,I've only been here for a semester but so far I can tell It's highly possible to have great career prospects a this school. However like any school you have to put in the work.
College Freshman,4,"be sure to go to ratemyprofessors.com to get reviews on your professors, so far I've had one professor who I didn't really enjoy, but overall the professors are good here"
College Freshman,4,"My college experience so far has been very enjoyable. As Long as you keep up with you work, and manage your time well, you should succeed at this school."
College Freshman,4,The professors are willing to help and cooperate  with students.
College Freshman,4,We always get updates about what is going on in the area. The updates can range form bad weather to a crime.
College Freshman,4,There are a few teachers who choose favorites but the others grade fairly.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy living in the dorms and being around people I know all the time.
College Freshman,4,I choose UIS for the small classes.
College Sophomore,4,"I think UIS is right on target with the curriculum, workload, and professors. I've never had any major complaints about any of theses things."
College Sophomore,4,"I found all of my classes thus far to be really interesting, even my gen eds which I was dreading.  Most professors are quick to reply to emails and sometimes even reached out to me or the class as a whole to give us extra, interesting information that they researched after a class discussion.  Class sizes are excellent, I do wish that there were a few lecture halls with bigger class sizes just for the experience."
College Sophomore,4,"Both dorms are new which is nice. I wish there were designated study areas with comfy furniture, sound proof walls, etc. I feel like some rules could be enforced more heavily, especially noise. They could also be cleaned much more often than they are. It's almost embarrassing when students visit campus and see dorms with dirty carpet."
College Sophomore,4,"I think it's strange that athletes and non-athletes use the same exercise equipment. However, the equipment is very nice and the recreation building is awesome"
College Sophomore,4,"The academic part of UIS is by far a great college experience. I wish there were more opportunities and options for socially active parts, especially on the weekends which can get kind of boring"
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms ate UIS are pretty simple, and easy to live in."
College Sophomore,4,"At the University of Illinois- Springfield, they have an event called Springfest every spring. What was so special about Springfest is it brings the entire school together to compete against each other. The entire experience is great because you are running around the campus  making a fool of yourself, and having a great time with it."
College Senior,4,Faculty were available to answer questions. Very personable.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't made it onto campus yet, but my experiences with registering for classes and orientation have been great."
College Junior,4,I enjoy the variety of people that I get to interact with on a regular basis. I have made some great friends.
College Sophomore,4,"I have never lived off campus, but I am currently looking for an apartment and have not had any trouble finding several options for varying prices."
College Sophomore,4,"The administration is strict, but they are fair. Some of the resident advisers play favorites and are more lenient with their friends than they should be."
College Sophomore,4,"The financial aid advisers are not always very friendly, but there are a large number of financial aid options available to students."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a large number of options; however, the food is pretty much always the same. The cafeteria also opens very late on weekends and is not open very late."
College Sophomore,4,The rooms is all housing options are much bigger than other universities.
College Freshman,4,"Really good, but I wouldn't pay for it out of my own pocket everyday"
College Freshman,4,I like the room size. I got a roommate that I am completely not compatible with.
Senior,2,"Very little sense of community here, and they charge you more money to go here than it's worth. Don't let the new Student Union entice you, it costs each student $200 extra per semester. I'm just ready to graduate and be done with this school."
Freshman,2,"A very boring school. There is absolutely no social life on campus, and the city of Springfield doesn't offer anything to do either. The potential is there, and solid connections through the government are possible. But the majority of students here are online or grad students, so you will have limited friend options. Finally, avoid the CAP honors program. More of a waste of academic credit than an actual honors program that fosters growth."
Niche User,2,"UIS is a very mediocre university. In terms of academics, it is quite inferior to other public universities in Illinois. The UIS housing does not accept the ""college lifestyle"" and enforces a high school like approach to living. When you transfer out (and you will), you will not receive credit for MANY courses including all CAP (honors program) courses. If you are looking into this university, you may as well just go to UofI and save a year or two."
College Freshman,2,If Greek Like is very important to you in your search for colleges. This school won't satisfy your needs
College Freshman,2,The is vary little Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,I feel like UIS could benefit from more of a nightlife/party scene. Students need something on the weekends for stress relief and you really kind have to look hard for it.
College Sophomore,2,"There is really limited parties, not much of a night life at all."
College Freshman,2,How aid is calculated is wrong based on actual need. My parents can't pay for my tuition when they spend the money that is recorded on bills.
College Freshman,2,"If you want to pay $400+ for a one bedroom apartment, this is a great idea. Otherwise, you're better off stay on campus or finding some friends to move in together."
College Freshman,2,There are three fast food places near the campus the rest are a good 15-20 minutes away. Most students eat on campus unless they are commuters.
College Freshman,2,There are more opportunities for business majors than for any other major.
College Freshman,2,Every restaurant except for Mcdonalds closes before 12am. So that sucks
College Freshman,2,"Compared to other universities, campus housing at UIS is not even average. Founders Hall is dirty. The halls and stairs are nasty. The lounges are not clean. The furniture and computers in the lounges need to be replaced. The rooms are a little too small. Lincoln residence hall looks ancient. Tuition is too high to have to deal with this.There are two residence halls and townhouses across the street. The school is supposedly trying to get more students to enroll but the amount of space makes that impossible. Where are the people going to go? The school is building a $21 million student union but there should be more on campus housing."
College Sophomore,2,On this campus the strictness level is ridiculously high. It seems like we can not do anything without being supervised or watched. The campus police are also ridiculous. They have nothing else to do but ruin our lives.
College Freshman,2,"I'm usually really bored, but I try my best to go downtown."
College Student,2,there is only a few Greeks on campus and they don't really do anything
College Student,2,"if you want to do anything off campus, you better find someone who has a car otherwise your stuck!"
College Student,2,"okay athletic center, there is no pool and there are a few student hangouts but they are at the far side of campus."
College Student,2,"they don't really have transportation on campus beside the city bus, and they are starting to get 1 shuttle"
College Student,2,"they only have a few options on campus, bio and computer science are the big ones here."
Junior,1,"I have been attending UIS online for 2 years, and there is a serious disconnect. The school provides little to no guidance. Advisors do not advise. They don't even reply to emails. Professors in the CS department do not reply to emails. This seems like a blanket statement, but in 2 years this has held true for all CS courses taken. Sometimes you wait weeks for grades, and have no clue if you are doing things correctly due to the severe lack of feedback to completed assignments. Degree plans change with no notice to the students, with previous courses no longer available, and degree audits not lining up between past degree plan and current. If you don't need advising, a clear plan or path of what your degree will consist of, feedback on work submitted, and fine with zero interaction, then this is the school for you."
Junior,1,"The online platform is nice. The instructors are MIA. Many courses involve external sites for reading/assignments, with little to no instruction from instructors. They don't actually have to submit grades or reply to students. It's the wild west of online learning."
Junior,1,Understand this: if you love high school and want the same cliquey vibe then go here! The administration is god awful the parties are horrible and the academics are so very terrible. The professors and the dorms help carry parts of the school up but you’d be lucky to meet a group of friends without one of them transferring to the plethora of better schools in Illinois. The campus location is awful and the school feels dead on the weekends. If you love yourself do. Not. Go. Here. Please if you have better options take them anyone who says this is a good school is lying to themselves and is content with getting a shitty degree from university of Illinois’ shit. University of Illinois-Springfield is a laughing stock of a school and like any other student here you should leave if you haven’t alredy (unless you’re content with a $35000 a year degree).
College Freshman,1,"There is no party scene. Everyone either goes to Illinois State University, SIUC, SIUE, UIUC for a party, or just go home for the weekend"
College Sophomore,1,The nightlife is the worst on campus mostly because it is very small here and this campus is beyond strict.
College Freshman,1,Nothing goes on around this campus ever. It is pretty boring.
College Student,1,They are SUPER strict here! you can't do anything on campus.
College Student,1,"the campus does not offer off campus living, you can choose on-campus town house or apartments. if you want to live off campus your on your own."
College Student,1,with the honors program they give you an unreasonable   workload in a super short amount of time. They don't care if you have other classes. facility is nice for the most part but you have some very crazy and bad professor as well.
College Student,1,Illinois weather sucks!!!! one day it will be 70 and the next it will be snowing and windy.
College Student,1,"there is never any parties on campus, and if there is a party the RAs show up in 2 seconds. The one bar close to campus has an age limit of 21 so you can't even get in, or get there if you have a car."
College Student,1,"Housing here is VERY strict!!!!!!!! and overall campus is HORRIBLE about cleaning up! There has been a lot of times were i will pass trash and food, and it has been there for a week! It takes months to have them fix anything, and everything is broken! If you want to do laundry forget it! the washer and driers don't work and you have to pay a lot, they also shrink your clothing."
College Student,1,The honors program is the biggest waste of your time! don't do it!!! They make you take the dumbest classes that don't help you at all! The honors program gives you so much busy work that you don't have anytime to do anything fun.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have off-campus housing
College Sophomore,1,"If you are sick at the moment, you might have to wait a whole week to be seen"
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life here
College Sophomore,1,The university does not have nursing as a major so I had to switch majors to stay at the school and avoid transferring.
College Junior,1,There is not much to do around the city unless you are over 21. There is the Lincoln home museum and stat capital building but that is about it. The town seems to be very racist. Every facility I enter around town has people that stare at me when I walk in. I have even seen people shove their kids away from me.
College Freshman,1,"what-life?? the campus police shut down parties faster than it takes to say ""chilling"".. there's apparently quite a few gay bars downtown so if you're gay, good for you. if you're not like me, life sucks! everyone goes to the neighboring cities like Urbana and St Louis for partying."
College Freshman,1,"unless you live in the townhouses/apartments(which are for upperclassmen), parking is TERRIBLE and expensive!"

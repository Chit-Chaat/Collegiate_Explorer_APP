Freshman,5,"I like how Point University is very warm welcoming meaning they are very friendly and very open minded when it comes to the decisions on what you are interested in majoring in at Point University. Also, I love the fact that Point University feels just like home to me meaning that they make sure that you feel like you are right at home and they always make sure  that you feel welcomed no matter what, I also love the small environment."
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience with point's online teachings is very good. Their online system is easy to learn, focus, and understand."
Junior,5,Over the last two years I have had an amazing experience at Point University. I am one of their online students and their staff has made it a smooth process. From IT tech staff to the teachers I don't have a negative thing to say. It has been a blessing being about to learn from like-minded people.
Freshman,5,"Being a freshman, I can see how great Point is. Since I have not been at the school for too long, I can tell that this school is one of the best that I have seen or visited."
Senior,5,Point university has satisfied all of my educational needs. I am able to learn at a pace that works well with my work schedule as I aim to finish my degree. The professors at Point have helped me grown in every aspect of my educational career as well as enhanced my writing skills. I love the dual degree with biblical studies you earn in line with your major. Transferring to Point University was one of the best decisions I have made. As I am coming to a close in my degree and reflect on all I have learned from Point I feel blessed. I have attended two other colleges and Point is the only university that excelled in all areas from admissions and financial aid to the curriculum being  taught. When I begin a graduate program I already know Point University will be where I attend.
Alum,5,I enjoyed the relationships you can build with the professors because of smaller classes. They are so knowledgable about their fields and truly care about you.
Niche User,5,"I really enjoyed my professors. They were really understanding and wanted you to learn. However, they were always strict on grades and your work."
Freshman,5,"My experiences are limited because I only been once, I love Point University, the diversity is something to be desired but the community is nice I like the area that the school is in."
Junior,5,"I love this school! It is smaller than regular universities however that means smaller classes and one on one time with Proffessor’s! I couldn’t have chosen a better school! Btw, the marching band is pretty awesome too!"
Graduate Student,5,"The university has wonderful professors who are helpful and insightful. Also, the curriculum is challenging and stimulates growth."
Freshman,5,"This year at PU has been a great start to my college years. They host many events to get to know others so being so far from home wasn’t that big of a deal. The athletic team and trainers are amazing. I injured my knee and my coach and trainers have been so supportive. I will be back on the field next year! There isn’t a contained campus but I was able to live in the dorms a block away from the academic building which was nice. Next year I will have to live further away which isn’t as convenient. I would recommend everyone have a car. Grocery shopping isn’t within walking distance and neither is the fields for sports. There is a Starbucks in the bookstore! It would be nice if the cafeteria was open more hours for athletes schedules. I can walk to a church I like on Sundays. I would recommend Point University! Soon more buildings will be up as they have proposed, that will be nice. The band is excellent, winning many awards."
Niche User,5,Point University is a very professional mannered school. The teachers are very communicative when you need to talk about anything. The students are very friendly and inspiring. This college is a very great college to be with in high school. If you are looking forward into their dual enrollment classes. Face to face and online everything works as one.
Niche User,5,"I love Point University because I get to further my knowledge alongside like-minded peers. I am in the Dual Enrollment program, so the classes are more challenging than classes at my high school."
Junior,5,"Point University has made college a great experience! I attend one of their extension campuses and it has been amazing! The faculty truly want you to do your best. They take the time to teach you and develop you spiritly, all the while teaching you academically. The administration and resources are impeccable, and they are so personable in everything they do!"
Senior,5,"Point University is  an awesome college and highly recommend this institution, whether you are entering to achieve a degree on campus or online.  I'm entering my senior year and due to graduate  in May 2018. The faculty and staff of Administrators at Point University go above and beyond for their students!!!"
Freshman,5,"Point University is a great school in general regarding academics but it is especially great for collegiate athletes because most of the students here are playing one of the 19 school sports that are offered here.  Since most students are student-athletes the teachers know how to work with coaches and trainers, along with the student, to better help the student with their schedule.  Being a student athlete I know how all of it goes, the classes, the workouts, the meetings, studying and then games that take place during a class.  So when I know that the teachers will help me and are considerate of my schedule that takes pressure off of me.  Then Point is also a Christian university and all faculty and staff are followers of Christ which is such a blessing to me. Because without Christ nothing really matters."
Niche User,5,I have really enjoyed the two visits I have had to Point University. The staff and faculty have been extremely warm and inviting.
College Senior,5,"The academics offered at my college are incredible, as well as the world-class leadership professors and staff of Highlands College. We are not like other ministry schools, because we do not just offer classes where we learn about church services, we have the chance to partake in church services every Sunday. We are offered hands-on ministry training. The workload is a lot, mostly because most students partake in dual-enrollment. But, it is not impossible to get all the work done that is required."
College Senior,5,"We are called to love others as Jesus has loved us. We do not agree with anything that is not listed in the Bible as accepting, but we do love those who may be gay, transgender, etc. We do not hate those who are different. We are fully acceptable to religion, because we are a Bible school."
College Senior,5,We are strictly enforced to have no drugs as well as no alcohol on campus. Ever.
College Senior,5,"I love my school because my professors and those on staff at my college are intentional, as well as active in each student's lives. The professors are always available to answer any questions we have, and many students as well as myself are able to look towards those on staff for leadership and guidance. Many of the men and women on staff pray over the student's lives daily."
College Senior,5,"After Highlands College, each student is offered to participate in a year long internship program. The internship can either be continued at Church of the Highlands, or even a different church throughout the country, or even internationally. The people on staff who work for job placement, work hard to ensure eavh student is working within a church vocationally if the student wishes to do so."
College Senior,5,"I feel completely safe and secure at my school. We are a Christian/Bible school, and average with less than 1,000 students attending. We have never had any sexual assault cases ever."
College Senior,5,"At Highlands College, all students are required to participate in athletics. We must take an intramural as well as workout class. There is a wide variety of courses to choose from within the athletics department of Highlands College including anything from boxing, to basketball, to even beach volleyball. Since we are not a university, our school's primary focus is not necessarily sports."
College Senior,5,"I am not only enrolled in Point University, but also in a world-class ministry school called Highlands College. Highlands College has been the absolute best experience of my life. I experience hands-on ministry training and I am constantly challenged as a student not just academically, but also mentally as well as spiritually."
College Student,5,the new dorms are too die for
College Junior,5,"The Center for Calling and Career is phenomenal! the Calling and Career Center hosts several events for prospective students, students, and parents (i.e. graduate college fairs, internship fairs, military opportunities, and career fairs).They also have resume and interview building courses, job postings, and volunteer opportunities."
College Junior,5,The quality of education is worth the tuition price. I can truthfully say that I have been enrolled in wonderful courses and learned many concepts that I will utilize in the work field.
College Freshman,5,"We do not have average dorms at Point University, instead we have an apartment complex. I love it. I have a kitchen, bathroom, living room, laundry room, bedroom, and a porch. Cleanliness checks are given by our RAs once a month, however I have been in several people's apartments and think that it would be appropriate to let the checks take place twice a month. I know several people who seem to leave food out to ruin and do not take care of the amazing living facility we have been provided with. The only downside to our apartment complex is that it is about 5 miles away from the academic centers. However, shuttle buses are provided for our convenience to get to the school when we need to."
College Freshman,5,"It is a small school where the president knows the name of most of the students. There are endless opportunities to get involved and if you do not attend an event, it is guaranteed that you will receive a phone call from several students about your absence. My favorite parts about Point University are the many events that are aimed at furthering my spiritual experiences and improving my walk with God. I've come to learn so much more about the greatest story of all time at Point - the story of God's creation and it's path to the coming recreation. The grand-narrative of the Bible is all about God's world and our part in it. God intends for us to bring all the people of the world that we can into his Kingdom. That is our assignment and goal until the day the Jesus Christ himself returns. I could honestly go on forever about everything I have learned about the grand narrative of the bible, our purpose in God's world, the disobedience of God's people leading to destruction and God's deliverance for us, the relationships that were changed with the fall of man in the book of Genesis, and the relationships that will be prepared with the returning of the King. Perhaps the greatest thing I have learned is about using the talents that I have been given for the glory of my God. I would not have gotten this incredible spiritual experiences anywhere else. If given the opportunity I would definitely not choose any other school. I can not think of anything that I would change about Point. There may not be the largest selection of classes, there may be gossip due to the small body count of the school, there may not be a sorority house or a famous football team, however the presence of God is present in my school and has already helped me form some of the best relationships I could ever have and get an amazing education. The most amazing part is I still have seven more semesters to enjoy."
College Junior,5,"Point University has great occupational therapy system, and I am going to enjoy it!"
College Junior,5,"Whether you're religious/spiritual or not, Point is a great school where you are a person and not just a number. Here professors care about who you are and want to get to know you. If you want to grow in your walk with Christ you have an abundance of way you can do so here as well. In addition to those things, I love all of our athletic teams and strongly support them."
College Sophomore,5,I like that the professors know you by name and when you are in need of help in any classes there is help available.
College Junior,5,"Point University has gone over and beyond my expectations as a college student. Coming to school here, I expected to go to class, workouts, and just do my thing. But Point is so much more than that. The community here is something I'd never experienced before, and I know the relationships built with both my fellow students and the staff are those that will last far beyond graduation. When you come to Point, you can feel the truth that you're a part of something bigger than yourself, and greater than you can ever imagined. The professors actually care about you, and make sure you know you're more than just a number, that you're a person with a story, and your story matters."
College Freshman,5,Everyone seems to be very satisfied with off-campus living.
College Freshman,5,Point offered me more money than any other school I applied at and I could tell they truly cared about making school affordable for me.
College Freshman,5,They have a strict 7 absence only before you get dropped out of the class.
College Freshman,5,"You usually have many underage drinking at other schools. But this school helps because they are so strict with their weekly dorm checks, and there's no tempting with drugs or alcohol, but off campus is another story of course."
College Freshman,5,"The work with you, and if you share how big of a need or if you had previous siblings before , they give more money"
College Sophomore,5,Point is a very athletic school
College Sophomore,5,Every teacher makes sure that you on track with your program. The registration process was a breeze as well!
College Junior,5,the college apartments are literally 30 seconds away from the campus
College Junior,5,no one here does drugs
College Junior,5,"the teachers are nice, and they take time for one on one if you need it"
College Junior,5,we get a membership to Gold's Gym and we have a sports area
College Junior,5,very clean and very nice
College Junior,5,"we had two snow days, but other than that the weather is good"
College Sophomore,5,"The program that I am in has prepared me in ways that I never expected. I have gained real-world experience and feel more than prepared to enter my prospective field once I graduate. As an education major, I feel that I have the upper-hand compared to students in the same program at other schools."
College Sophomore,5,"I would definitely come back to Point if I could do it all over again. I felt invested in at this university. I was surrounded by professors, staff, and even students who believed in me and truly cared about me. I wouldn't trade that experience for the world."
College Sophomore,5,I am a Counseling and Human Services major and I love it. We have professors who have been in the field for years and are truly passionate about their jobs. They are always available for to talk to us and help us with whatever we need. The workload is not bad at all and there are plenty of internship and job opportunities available to us!
College Sophomore,5,"Every student here lives in an apartment, including the freshman. The apartments are really nice. Almost every student that has lived on campus has loved the apartments."
College Freshman,5,"Like I have said before, everyone here get along fairly regardless of your race, economic background, political beliefs, or religion."
Recent Alumnus,5,I interned as a music minister at a local church and it was great. I got a chance to apply all that I had learned from the music department and it was just awesome for me. I got paid about 50 bucks a week but it was worth it.
Recent Alumnus,5,It's a very close knit department where everyone looks out for each other. Yes I enjoy having the closeness with fellow musicians.
Recent Alumnus,5,The financial aid process was quick. They'll have you in and out without all the run around like other campuses.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Point University is located in downtown West Point. The people who live here have been here for years and there isn't much through traffic at all. The campus is positioned in a really nice neighborhood, I often enjoy looking at the beautiful homes. Crime is nonexistent at Point University."
Recent Alumnus,5,For the most part Point University is a drug free school. No one openly talks about drugs here at all. If anyone uses them I would be surprised. Usually if there is an issue at the school it would be addressed in a chapel services. Haven't had one on the topic of drugs yet. 
Recent Alumnus,5,"Dining near the campus of Point University is pretty adventurous. There are a lot of hidden gems in the city that you wouldn't know about unless you had the transportation to get there. You might have to go down a few back roads to get there but man it is worth it. There are all kinds of mom and pop diners that cook up some of the best southern food you've ever tasted. If you love discovering new things, you'll love dining in the Greater Valley Area."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Point University consists of people from varying backgrounds which really allow students to become more culturally aware of the world around them. Here at Point, I've learned that many of us are similar regardless or race but yet we are different in many ways. Being able to share differences in culture and values have helped shape me as a believer and allows me to see the world from a different point of view which will helpful in the business sector."
College Sophomore,5,Financial Aid office has been great to me for the last two years. I have received so much help with aid and how to get more money to cover my tuition so that I do not have a huge portion for my parents to make.
Freshman,4,For right I am going to begin fall semester by taking all my classes online.I hoping that goes well with this being my.  freshman year in college I am so excited but also nervous at the same time considering this is a really big step in life because I am moving on to bigger things throughout my adult life.
Sophomore,4,I like point because its is very open and flexible. Point is very friendly towards new comers. Its easy to take classes and learn new subjects. The housing and food is very interesting and inviting.
Sophomore,4,I am a second year student at point and i love it there. It’s full of great and friendly people who make sure your comfortable. Point keeps you active with small groups and even just events to make sure your not just getting your education but that your also. Enjoying your time there.
Senior,4,"Class sizes are small, most of the professors are great, and it's been a great school to attend so far. Where it lacks is in coaching for athletics.  The diverse student body is great, but I've experienced it first hand and my friends in other sports too have struggled with who they have chosen as coaches for different sport teams. It's a great school, it just struggles partially in athletics. I've been able to meet some great people, and in the end I'm glad I've come here."
Sophomore,4,I think Point University is a great school with some professors who are willing to go the extra mile to help you grow academically and professionally. It's a good place to get connected with other people in order to learn and a lot of people are happy to help.
Sophomore,4,"I am a online student, one thing that I love about Point University is that is a Christian School who really cares about their students and their situations. The Professors are all great and qualified who responds quickly with any questions a student has."
Niche User,4,I attend Point University through dual enrollment at my school.  Some classes are online and one class I go to satellite campus in Peachtree City.  I enjoy the classes that I experienced this year and last year.
Freshman,4,The staff are very friendly. They help in any way that they can. It is a great and safe environment.
Junior,4,"I enjoy the family friendly atmosphere that Point University has to offer. Their staff and teachers do the best they can to help ensure that students are learning, taken care of, and equipped with the best."
Graduate Student,4,"Point is a great school! Super small class sizes, and staff and professors that actually take time to get to know the students. Each professor connects the topic to the Bible, since it is a Christian college"
Niche User,4,"I have attended the Peachtree City campus for a year in a DE program. It's pretty quiet, not much goes on around here."
Niche User,4,"Point University is a great college. Not too much to get in to, which mean more focus on school. Student life is great everyone gets alone so well and the food is outstanding."
Freshman,4,Great staff and helpful staff! The teachers really want you to understand what you are learning! Keep in mind that the peachtree city campus is mainly dual enrollment high school students!!!
Freshman,4,The campus is very welcoming . Both the professors and faculty are willing to work with you. For example If 25% of the class failed a test then your professors with add bonus points on the your homework. If you help studying ask early in the semester tutoring is always open for studies and seniors are willing to help out if they can. But keep track of your aid.
College Senior,4,"Since my college is not a normal college, we do not necessarily offer student housing. We offer instead housing through an apartment complex about five minutes away from the campus. The apartment complex is clean, affordable, and the environment is excellently created."
College Student,4,the football team is really good
College Student,4,the school is great so far youll have much fun
College Freshman,4,There are always police surrounding the campus.
College Freshman,4,"Overall, I really enjoy Point Park."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy Point Park University but I am changing my major that the school does not offer.
College Junior,4,The athletic facilities are great at Point University! The only addition that I would recommend would be to have a sports nutrition program.
College Junior,4,I am a current junior at the university and I truly enjoy the atmosphere of the school. The small and intimate class sizes makes it easier for students to learn and to have a personal relationship with their professors. I am a student athlete and since I have been at the university the athletic program has continued to flourish. New sports are always added and different opportunities are always available for student athletes. Overall I am pleased with the education that i have received thus far!
College Freshman,4,"I have Attention Deficit Disorder, which really means I have a difficult time paying attention in class. My small classes make paying attention 100% easier for me because I get to sit on the front row and sometimes actually have a conversation with the professor about the topic we are discovering. My professors do not know me as a face out of 200 students but rather they know me as McKenzie Anderson. I love it. The courses that are offered cover a variety of topics however I feel as if I'm stuck to am exact class list because of my major. I do not feel like I have been given the opportunity to explore different majors or different ideas."
College Freshman,4,"I am only a freshmen so I do not have any experience with internships and jobs through the school. However I do know that some seniors at our school have gained internship opportunities at churches in my home town as well as some of my friends getting a job as a youth pastor in local churches. For the younger student, opportunities are presented to have a job on campus to earn money. For example:  working concession stands and helping organize files and working as a tutor."
College Freshman,4,"Our athletic programs are of course not as big as most universities in the state. However, in several sports Point University has been one of the best teams in the region. For such a small school, the stands at all the sporting events are always filled with support from the student body. It is amazing to see new people at every athletic event and to see students building new relationships by getting involved."
College Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere and the people here are really awesome.
College Sophomore,4,Point University has opened my belief in my religion and comfort me in my first year of college. The athletic compition has made me stronger than I ever was. Point is so unique because I can be apart of organizations that are starting up and say once I have graduated that I was a part of something. I would choose Point again because the atmosphere was encouraging to do well in school.
College Junior,4,"I am a transfer, and everything I have seen so far makes me believe I am going to he right place."
College Freshman,4,There are many different places where we can go eat and get food at.
College Freshman,4,I believe that the strictness is appropriate.
College Freshman,4,It's a lot better than people will give it credit for.
College Freshman,4,I love living on campus here. We live in apartments so it spacious but everyone is close enough to all come together and I love it.
College Freshman,4,Its away from the actual school so it is nice to kind of get away from the whole atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,It went very smoothly. The staff is very helpful and open to answer any questions at anytime.
College Freshman,4,"I love the fact that they take and listen to suggestions that are made to improve the school. Some days there are also special treats for each holidays. For the food to be as good as it is, they should be open on the weekends."
College Sophomore,4,We have two bedroom apartments so that's nice.  The only bad thing is we have to furnish half of it ourselves.
College Sophomore,4,We have security guards and campus police and have no problem helping when we need them.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of people at Point are seeking a degree in teaching. It is very helpful to have so many like you.
College Sophomore,4,So far the school is very fair on school and homework.
College Sophomore,4,It's close to the school and they even provide transportation!
College Junior,4,"there are people from every ethnic group, every country, and every religion"
College Sophomore,4,"We have shuttle buses that take us to the apartments, to the school, and to the gym. I live 6 hours away from the school so I use to drive before I wrecked recently."
College Sophomore,4,"The night life at our school isn't the typical party scene. You will find the CLM ""Campus Life Ministry"" students doing their jobs to ensure everyone is enjoying their week. The different sports teams get together and sometimes they hang out in each others apartments."
College Sophomore,4,"Although we are provided help getting into programs at Point, the requirements are somewhat challenging academically. For my program, Education, we are required to pass the first round of GACE testing, have a 2.5 GPA and complete a professional portfolio. I enjoyed this process because I feel that it is preparing for the job-searching process. In order to become a part of this career field, I must rise to the expectations."
College Sophomore,4,I have never felt unsafe on campus. We have 24/7 security available to us.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of people find their future spouse here. I've seen a lot of successful relationships come from this school.
College Sophomore,4,The internet is usually pretty reliable. We have computer lab with printers. We can print and copy as much as we want with no extra cost to us.
College Sophomore,4,We have great off campus dining! There is a wide variety of places we can choose from. We also get student discounts at a lot of these places so that is a plus!
College Senior,4,It is great! everyone accepts you despite your color or race. 
College Senior,4,"the student life on campus is good because we have a lot of facilities that we can use such as the sportsplex center and in it is a swimming pool, weight room, gym, and a cardio room."
College Senior,4,the only ones that they are strict about is alcohol and drugs on campus.
College Senior,4,I don't worry about safety here because our security does a good job at that!
College Senior,4,the community is what separates it from others because everyone wants to get to know you. people here love interacting. it is also christian based meaning that while you get an education you are also learning about your religion.
College Senior,4,There is a lot to choose besides the apartments we live in. there are other apartments that are close to the ones we live in and are extremely nice but also more expensive.
College Senior,4,The use of drugs and alcohol is not permitted on campus but people still do it. If students are caught there is a possibility of being kicked out of school.
College Senior,4,"The academic of Point University is good. The professors want to see you succeed in real life so they do their part by applying ""real world"" applications in their teachings. the workload can be a lot depending on how many hours you are taking."
College Senior,4,Being a Business major at Point is great! my professors allows us to experience what it the real world looks like by giving us projects for companies that expect big things. this opens up possibility of job opportunities because you get to make a lot of connections with companies that you work with while in class.
College Senior,4,The parking space fills up quickly and the size is not big enough for students to park. the security campus almost never hands out parking tickets. 
College Sophomore,4,"There is no cost to park, but you do have to have a parking sticker. There really isn't much need for enforcement because we have a good amount of parking but they can fill up fairly quickly. "
College Senior,4,we live in apartments instead of dorms which is much better! the cost is not expensive when you take into considerations that they are apartments. the only downfall is that it is about fifteen minutes away from the school.
Senior,2,"I loved Point University when I first started! They were friendly and helpful, but now they have hired a few bad apples. The financial aid office sucks! Half the time the advisors are not in the office and the rest of the time they are rude! They NEVER call back and they seem to have attitudes when you keep following up on a problem... I have been consistently contacting them about an issue for 3 weeks now and it still hasn't been resolved!!! Back when I first started Id leave one voicemail with financial aid, and I would recieve a call back within the hour and if I missed the call Id have a voicemail and email resolving my problem. And being busy isn't an excuse for 3 weeks!!! And the issue is a mess up on their end, i was shorted my refund!I am supposed to wait months on this issue yet every   semester the tuition is going up?!And best believe they want their money!"
College Freshman,2,Not many people pay attention to sports at PPU. I wish there was more focus towards them.
College Freshman,2,"You have to usual McDonalds, you have to leave to town in order to her different food."
College Sophomore,2,It's sometimes a pain when all the paperwork gets lost or isn't in order.
College Senior,2,"I don't go around partying so its a bit sad. I'm more focused on my education. there are nightclubs not to distant from the school that some people may or may not go. Also, there is a pub in town that students go to hang out."
College Freshman,2,There is no Greek life at Point University. The college size maybe a factor in having a Greek life.
College Freshman,2,Our dorm rooms and the actual college are 15 minutes away by vehicle. So considering that we rely on the shuttles to get us there but on the weekend they are not running so our cars get us where we need to be. 
College Freshman,2,The education at Point university is a joke for the most part. The classes are almost all extremely easy where u can get an A just from cramming for a few hours the night before the test. Most of the learning is just professors reading power-points of whats pretty much a review of what the book says. However the science classes are pretty tough and take some paying attention and some studying for. There are a few other classes that you can also really learn from. There is not much homework but there are quite a few tests quizzes and essays. The professors are all pretty nice and helpful. The class sizes are small so if you have a question the teacher can probably answer it.
College Sophomore,2,A nurse is not available on campus but there are local doctors.
College Sophomore,2,"At Point, you are only allowed to receive one type of scholarship. If you are an athlete, you get an athletic scholarship. If you are a scholar, you get an academic scholarship. And because the school just expanded last year, the scholarship money has been spread around to many students to increase the enrollment. Hopefully, in the near future, some larger scholarships will be awarded to deserving students and more than one type of scholarship will be awarded if it has been earned."
College Student,2,theres nothing here we have to go towns over just to shop and if you don't have a car your in a bad situation
College Freshman,2,"Sp far my experience has been somewhat okay. I have made great friends but the college is not something it is made out to be. There needs to be more open communication between the ""favored students and leaders"" and the students who like to actually stay in their rooms and get work done. They need to find ways especially on the weekends that students who stay on campus during the weekends can become involved. People do not stay on campus on weekends because it is boring and because there is absolutely nothing to do besides homework."
College Senior,1,We do not offer a party scene at my school; it is prohibited.
College Senior,1,"We do not have a party scene available at my college, due to it being a Bible school."
College Freshman,1,"I don't think there is any off campus housing, unless you live at home still ."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have any off campus housing that the school help with. The students have to find their own housing if they want to live off campus.
College Freshman,1,"I'm writing this in the perspective of a guy. At point university there are almost no girls. The ratio of guys to girls is something like 18-1. Now that's not to say there are no attractive girls at this school because there are, but at such a small school  when the girl population is so much smaller than the guy it gets annoying. The people at school are all pretty nice and easy to get along with. Its not hard to make friends if you are an athlete, a musician, or are religious. Those are the main people who go to Point. Especially the athletes. Most students at this school play a sport, and the sport played the most is football. You will have about an average of 5-6 football players per class and the classes are no bigger than 30 people. Most people at the school are pretty country."
College Freshman,1,"There is almost nothing to do at Point University. West point is a small town some shops here and there, and is fifteen minutes away from the apartments so nobody drives over there to do anything. The apartments are in valley Alabama which is even worse and the only thing to do is hang out the apartments or go to a small rec center across the street. There is a bad turn out at sports events and there is a bad atmosphere there. Point University is a very boring lackluster school."
College Freshman,1,Internet Access Is Slow – Our lab dont get to crowded.printing on campus is free an always working but the wireless access is so slow.

Freshman,5,I love the environment here on BYU campus. It is very accepting despite everything going on with Corona. The faculty and staff also do their best to make learning still engaging and exciting despite the new changes and regulations due to Corona.
Freshman,5,"I've loved my time at Brigham Young University! I think all the professors are well educated and they are able to effectively teach and connect to their students. I've met many wonderful people and become friends will them. One thing I love about BYU, is the sense of family that is established by the school itself. I feel like everywhere I go on campus there are people who are happy to help me and who care for me individually. I've been really impressed at the efforts of the staff here to make sure we, as students, are having a good time and a smooth transition into college life. I think I have been given many resources to ensure that I have lots of success as a student and I know where to go if I need help with anything. BYU is doing a really good job at making sure students stay safe, but at the same time I have still been able to meet new people and make new friends. I also love the academic environment that we have here where everyone is trying to do their best in school."
Freshman,5,"This year has been super unique, but I've been super impressed with the efforts made by BYU to make sure that our online experience is going smoothly. All my professors have the tools they need to make teaching as fluid as possible. The start of the school year was very smooth and easy for me and took of a lot of stress and anxieties that I was feeling about the start of school. Professors have made sure to make classes still engaging and possible to participate while also keeping everyone safe. Although, it's a lot harder to meet people in my classes I think BYU has done a good job still making that possible; for example, I have been able to put small study groups together to meet both over zoom and also at the library and prepare for tests. I was nervous to see how online learning would go, but I have been pleased with how organized it has been."
Senior,5,This university has a strong sense of campus culture where we look out for each other. The curriculum and content is intellectually enlarging and spiritually strengthening. The professors and teacher's assistants are willing to help and accessible. The campus has student programs that help students network and take their skillset and what they learn on campus to the workforce.
Freshman,5,"It's been way better than I could have ever expected an online college experience to be! I have actually really enjoyed my classes through Zoom, and my assignments online. It's definitely a different and new challenge to be facing, but it provides everyone a chance to grow in ways they didn't know they were capable of. Online learning has been an experience that has required flexibility and patience, but it has given us the chance to still feel the college experience at a lower level."
Freshman,5,"The very first thing that I loved the most about BYU, was the beautiful campus! It is such a beautiful environment everywhere you go, and so peaceful, providing a lot of study places and opportunities. Every one here is motivated and focused with their studies giving great opportunity to be in a professional and influential environment. There are so many opportunities and resources everywhere you go! The professors, staff, and administration are all so encouraging and supportive. Going to BYU provides you with a safe, comfortable place to study what you love at an advanced level. It's a positive and great environment to learn and grow!"
Sophomore,5,I've loved my experience here so far. I like how challenging yet fulfilling the academics are here. There are lots of opportunities to network and gain good skills. Beautiful campus.
Freshman,5,BYU is a great school. Excellent professors and a very friendly and open environment.  It is school very focused on helping individuals apply all learning to broader application and purpose.
Freshman,5,I am currently taking all 15 credits online. It's different but teachers have adjusted very well and it doesn't impede education whatsoever.
Senior,5,I have loved attending Brigham Young University. The classes are rigorous and challenging and the unique rules of the BYU campus have made it easier to focus on school. I have also been impressed with divisions of the school such as the Ballard Center and Marriott School of Business. Having them on campus has provided students with unique opportunities to participate in groups and classes that wouldn't normally be provided by the school.
Senior,5,Teachers work hard to make the online learning experience beneficial. Most of the online classes I've taken have been fantastic and engaging. It's also nice to have the added flexibility provided by some instructors.
Senior,5,"Brigham Young University has provided me with not only a fantastic education, but has been a place where I've been able to network and form a group of friends that will be a benefit throughout my life and career. The tuition is minimal compared to the quality of education. Truly the ""Best Value: college I know of!"
Freshman,5,"Most classes have been online, but substance is still great and there is so much to learn. There are also still ways to meet others and have fun."
Sophomore,5,BYU is an excellent school for the price. They usually are very helpful with technology and can be very understanding.
Senior,5,BYU is a great school for people who are looking for a campus that's fun and safe. Professors are kind and tuition rates are great!
Senior,5,I've started taking online classes and they've been going great. I have no complaints and/or worries!
Alum,5,My overall experience with Brigham Young University was uplifting and academic. Every class I took tested me and helped me improve my understanding of the world and its functions as well as help me appreciate the world that I live in and my purpose in it.
Graduate Student,5,"BYU does a great job in focusing on experiential learning — they have great academics, while providing opportunities to apply learning outside of the classroom or in lab settings."
Graduate Student,5,"BYU has everything! The campus is beautiful, the athletic teams are great and fun to watch. The campus feels really safe and there are great activities in the city and on campus."
Freshman,5,"I just got here as a freshman this year. I moved in last week, and my experience has already been amazing! As my dream school, they haven't let me down! My teachers have been great at communicating what I need for classes. They've been so understanding with COVID-19 happening, and they're finding new ways to make class just as fun and personable as when we could go all the time in person. I've loved every second, and I'm hoping to continue that love throughout the years."
Freshman,5,I have not yet taken my online classes through BYU but it appears that they are very prepared to make it a good semester with online classes. Several teachers have already been in contact with me about class work that is already available online brought different sites such as canvas.
Freshman,5,Brigham young university is a very good school. The academics are very sufficient and the tuition is cheap. It is a great school for me because I am a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Unfortunately this year has been messed up by Covid so I haven’t gotten the full college experience because my classes are all online. But when they do have events there is a lot to choose from and it is a very nice school.
Junior,5,"I have loved my experience at BYU! The campus is beautiful, there are good mix of challenging and easier classes (especially depending on the subject), and lots of excellent people! I love the emphasis on lifelong progression and service. I have a lot of respect for nonmembers (of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) who attend BYU, because I think it could prove more difficult (like it would be with attending any religious school while not being part of that religion). Because of the religion, parties are a lot different than would be expected from most people, but there are still parties and lots of other social activities! Tuition is remarkably cheap for the excellent education that is available! Highly would recommend!"
Junior,5,I think BYU did an excellent job with transitioning online during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were very fair and understanding to the students and are always open for questions/suggestions.
Sophomore,5,"BYU has an excellent balance of scholastic excellence, social life, and spiritual well-being.  It it a very welcoming community full of students and teachers who want to excel in their respective disciplines."
Sophomore,5,I've had to take some classes partly online due to COVID-19 and they were excellent. Very organized and easy to participate in.
Sophomore,5,BYU is a great school with lots of opportunities. There is a loving atmosphere there and lots of opportunities to make friends or do what you love.
Freshman,5,"I know that in BYU they use the Canvas learning platform to do study online. It's fairly straightforward and easy to use, and my.byu.edu is really easy to navigate, as is the online Learning Suite. I like how most professors communicate really well with students about assignments. I'm excited to learn more about it as I go into more classes."
Freshman,5,"I love my university because of our high standards, dedication to learning and developing spiritually, emotionally, and academically. The teachers are committed to making sure each student has a safe and memorable experience, the campus life is relaxing and fun, and there are so many wonderful opportunities for socializing, work, recreation, and applied study. One thing I would like to see more of is racial diversity - the Black and Hispanic community makes up less than 2% of the student population at BYU, and as part of that small percentage, I feel it is a great responsibility to be an example. I definitely would like to see larger acceptance of a variety of students from different backgrounds. Another thing I have high praise for is the affordability of the school, and the ability to find a variety of jobs on and off campus. They definitely make sure you have the tools to succeed in whatever field you are interested in, as well as many resources like peer mentoring, counseling, etc"
Freshman,5,It is a large school but it is so well organized that you can feel right at home very easily. I have not met a member of the staff that was rude or dismissive. They have been respectful and helpful.
Alum,5,I like online classes. They allow me not to be held back or bothered the cumbersomeness of classrooms/large classes.
Alum,5,"I only took 1 class online. It was great, but I never felt any need to take online classes when there were so many fantastic professors in real life."
Alum,5,"My experience at BYU was everything I could have asked for. Classes were hard, but I was given clear reasons why I needed to take what I did, and I got the job I wanted. I qualified for a couple scholarships and grants and graduated without debt. The social atmosphere is amazing, and I jumped into sports, clubs and church activities. Unless you're looking for alcohol and partying, this is a place to have a good time. I had several professors that were fantastic, and at least one that was absolutely life changing."
Alum,5,"Absolutely loved BYU. An amazing experience and a unique culture. Many opportunities to engage in sports, activities, learning, and growth."
Sophomore,5,"Great positive environment, filled with friendly people and professors. The class sizes are very large, especially for general requirements. Unfortunately, there isn’t a whole lot of diversity."
Sophomore,5,Everything has gone pretty well initially the classes were more rigorous and difficult than in person classes due to COVID-19 but then they mellowed out. You are still taught the same things they just put more focus on trying to provide you resources to help.
Sophomore,5,The education provided is some of the very best in the world. A lot of professors are leading in their industry and remain engaged in their field. They focus on your education and keep the courses rigorous and you are forced to be engaged with the classes. The quality of school is great. I was able to tour many ivy league schools and no offense to their campuses but BYU tops them all. There isnt a whole lot of diversity but they are putting a focus on getting more diversity. There is an honor code so alcohol is not allowed to be used. There may be lots of rules but the education is worth it.
Junior,5,"I've loved my time at BYU so far! Most everyone is nice, teachers are always willing to help you learn, and the campus is beautiful. Not to mention how cheap tuition is!"
Sophomore,5,"My experience with the online classes offered by the university have been satisfactory. I have taken 2 online classes. Teachers have the topic learned and organized from the beginning. They also have questions, answers, and exercises prepared for the students. They offer immediate help and accept different learning methods that lead the student to success."
Sophomore,5,"My experience from the beginning was pleasant. They have offered me a lot of guidance and help to start my first semester with strength.
I like this university because it shows great interest in each of its students. It also has different types of help such as academic, work, or personal.
What I would like to see change is how they distribute scholarship information to new students who are starting the semester."
Niche User,5,"A great school, lots of diversity, large campus, cheap tuition, friendly students and professors, awesome facilities, large library."
Niche User,5,"I did not take classes online during my attendance at this school, because I did not need to for this time period."
Freshman,5,"The classes are like every other online class, they can be difficult to adjust to but it's been easy for me and the professors are very compensating for the switch and difficulty of technology."
Freshman,5,I love their school spirit and focus around living a good life with God in your life. They encourage that you are involved with clubs and activities you like. They also have a great system to support you in you academics and getting good grades like free tututoring.
Freshman,5,"There is a very positive perspective on campus, and the students have a strong desire to work hard in their classes. The atmosphere can come across as competetive at times though, which can take some time to adjust to. There are dozens of different resources to help the students cope with the stresses and challenges of college life, and there are always fun activities going on in the various departments."
Freshman,5,All the professors are so positive and engaging and give you every resource to succeed in their class.
Freshman,5,It's very convenient and they offer a lot of different online class formats (like live zoom sessions or on demand learning) and the same amount of resources you would expect in a classroom.
Freshman,5,They have handled online classes VERY well. The professors are caring and want all of the students to do well.
Freshman,5,I have been able to learn the material well while not having to go to class. Professors have been very understanding about stress during online classes.
Alum,5,BYU promotes and inspires lifelong learning and service and offers a wonderful variety of studies while providing students great resources for learning and growth.  I love how BYU's mission aligns with that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  Students who are seeking a rich education while trying to grow closer to their Savior Jesus Christ will surely find a wonderful home here.
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online classes while I was going to school, but I used many online resources such as AIM, other student portal resources, BYU's websites, etc. and always felt that BYU's online interface was resourceful and navigable."
Junior,5,"I love BYU. There are some problems with diversity, however the culture, people and facilities are very nice."
Sophomore,5,"I love BYU. Prior to finding my niche, I struggled with enjoying school and the culture. BYU has a large population of students with the same religious background and similar backgrounds (to a degree obviously), so for outsiders this may present unique challenges. I believe that many of the student body would gladly welcome and befriend others who may not share as much with the student body at large, however, just the unique differences might intimidate those who attend that might not fit the more traditional mold. Again, the student body is awesome and inviting, the plain differences might just be intimidating. Also, it is a very conservative and religious school so be prepared for that."
Sophomore,5,"Online learning at BYU is very effective. I have loved taking online courses and the professors and their TAs do an awesome job in helping the students to succeed. It does take self-discipline to log in and push forward, but if you have the desire BYU certainly provides the resources to succeed."
Freshman,5,"Brigham Young University is very diverse, which I find to be really cool, since students from all over the world come here. Also, the teachers here are amazing. I loved all the professors I had last semester, and I'm sure that's not a coincidence"
Sophomore,5,"I have really loved BYU. The education is amazing. I always feel like I am learning something valuable in my classes. There is an amazing feeling on campus. I have always felt safe and cared for. Students are there to gain an education and make new friends, not just party. Students are very responsible and, because of the Honor Code, they live great lifestyles for their age. I love this school!"
Junior,5,"BYU is a place where learning is highly encouraged, as well as the highest conduct of moral standards. 
I'd like to see more diversity and have the university be more representative of the worldwide membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints."
Freshman,5,"Every person that I have come into contact with concerning my classes, enrollment, and housing has been extremely helpful and patient. They are clearly trained well in their expressed areas of expertise and know how to help student with their many, varying problems and concerns."
Junior,5,"They've taken it to the next level; as things have crashed, their response has been phenomenal. From the top down to the teachers, everyone has been willing and wanting to help make this crazy time easier. They have lessened the stress level and helped us to figure out our lives in a fantastic fashion."
Junior,5,"I've loved my time at BYU. The campus is beautiful, the classes are engaging, and the professors are dedicated to helping students succeed. There is a lot to do around Provo, and BYU holds a lot of fun activities and clubs."
Freshman,4,The teachers are doing a wonderful job at making the online learning doable and engaging. They still have high expectations but are also very understanding with the current situation.
Freshman,4,"My current freshman experience has exceeded expectations, especially in regard to a COVID-effected first year. The academics and student resources here are phenomenal. My professors have found a fine balance between leniency and strict priority. In spite of social restrictions, I have had the opportunity to safely meet peers from many different socio-economic backgrounds and nationalities. Student jobs have provided the opportunity to find a cohesive balance between school, employment, and student life as a whole.


My largest complaint would have to be in the dance programs. Without scholarships or previous experience, progressing has been quite difficult. Because of COVID restrictions, practice space is limited and priority is most often to students of high-level students, thus severely limiting the progress of us beginners. This goes without saying that there have been little to no entry-level classes available."
Senior,4,"I took two classes online through Brigham Young University. There were always help sources available, and I learned a lot through the classes through collaborating with other students from around the country."
Niche User,4,I really like the campus. I've been to it a lot of times and spent weeks there at campus and it's really nice. This college has been recommended to me by a lot of peers and family who have received their degrees here and I'm looking forward to continuing my education there.
Niche User,4,"I took online classes with brigham young university for a while and didn't love it that much, but in person classes are much better."
Sophomore,4,"I like how BYU offers a lot of online classes so I can make my schedule more flexible. I'm not really an online learner, but it was all doable. Easier than in-person classes depending on what course you are taking."
Freshman,4,"My online experience has been great. I enjoy having the opportunity to experience class while lessening COVID-19 risks. I moved off-campus to my parents' house and being able to still attend class while living more remotely has been a great blessing. The teachers try hard to facilitate the experience, and while we do have technical problems some days (my Chemistry teacher sometimes has difficulties figuring out audio), overall it's really nice to be able to communicate with other students during class about what the professors are teaching. I think if this were an option in the future, I would definitely like it."
Senior,4,"The college has done a great job of transitioning to online learning. I was enrolled in classes for winter and during both the spring and summer terms, so I had the chance to see the transition. Most classes were able to make the switch quickly. The biggest holdup has been getting older professors used to the new technology."
Freshman,4,"Classes online are more difficult, but teachers and ta's are always there to answer questions and help out."
Senior,4,Overall the education I have received at BYU has been exceptional. Professors as a general rule have been very kind and very passionate about the topics they teach. Any issues I have with BYU have less to do with the university and more to do with the culture. I would like to see a cultural shift towards greater diversity and greater empathy among the students and faculty but I do feel that I got a quality education for a very fair price.
Freshman,4,"The people and professors are so nice, and the atmosphere is great. The campus is nice and it is easy to make friends!"
Junior,4,"BYU is currently offering online and hybrid courses due to COVID restrictions, and these seem pretty standard as far as online courses go.  The professors and TAs have scheduled opportunities to interact live with their students, and apart from a couple of hiccups as far as correctly listing email addresses, it feels almost easier to get in touch than before online courses were being used."
Junior,4,High education and professional yet fun teachers. Material is challenging and teaches you many new concepts.
Junior,4,Online is tough but nothing impossible to manage. Teachers give you good resources to stay on task in the class.
Alum,4,"The online learning experience was surprisingly good. I took many online or hybrid courses throughout my college career and never once did I feel as though it was lacking in material, participation, professor interest, or applied learning opportunities. 

Even when COVID-19 hit and campus had to shut down, the faculty and staff quickly created and easy-to-navigate online adaptation to complete the semester fairly. This was especially impressive for my lab classes such as anatomy and chemistry."
Freshman,4,"It's been a little difficult getting the hang of everything, being a new freshman and all. But, the professors have made online learning so much easier, and they've been so helpful to all the students. Whether it's answering questions, or making sure we have the right resources, or just understanding when things get a little difficult. They're awesome, and I can't wait to continue."
Sophomore,4,Online classes are done very well considering most professors are out of their element when it comes to teaching online.  The professors are always willing to help however they can.
Freshman,4,"Super fun! Culture can be a little annoying at times, but it's a lot of fun if you meet the right people. Always a lot to do."
Freshman,4,"Online learning wasn't my favorite, but the professors were understanding and willing to work with you. It was super unorganized but that's expected; the professors didn't know that was going to happen either."
Senior,4,"I felt that BYU adapted very quickly to online learning. The professors are so dedicated to their students, that they all did what they could to make the transition as fair and smooth as possible.

I feel like my professors have been great at using online tools and making things run smoothly in that way. However, I do feel like sometimes the online workload needs to be lessened just a bit to account for the circumstances not being prime for every learner."
Senior,4,"I felt that BYU adapted very quickly to online learning. The professors are so dedicated to their students, that they all did what they could to make the transition as fair and smooth as possible.

I feel like my professors have been great at using online tools and making things run smoothly in that way. However, I do feel like sometimes the online workload needs to be lessened just a bit to account for the circumstances not being prime for every learner."
Niche User,4,"I loved Brigham Young University because of the sports. There's nothing I love more than college basketball, and BYU's team was fun to watch. The environment of the games was absolutely astounding. Light shows and loud music ringing throughout the gym made my heart happy. Not only was it fun to watch basketball games, but volleyball, soccer, football, and even tennis were all impressive and exciting matches and games to attend. One thing that could change about BYU is the diversity. It would be nice to see a more diverse student body and participate with people from different backgrounds."
Freshman,4,Most professors knew what they were doing but there were some that had trouble getting a hang of it.
Sophomore,4,"Brigham Young University has an excellent geographical location, pleasant weather, devout religious culture, low tuition, and outstanding academic performance. Business (accounting), computer science, education, and law major are popular for students. It is a good choice for those who want to save money and interested in these majors."
Junior,4,"Like all universities, you get a mix of amazing professors with some mediocre ones. It is great for the value you pay for a private university, though. The campus is beautiful but always seems to have one part in construction. If you are one who enjoys the outdoors (like I do) and don't mind a lack of diversity (that was a change from southern California) it has a great social life."
Junior,4,The layout is very plain and simple and the professors I had try to work with you and respond much faster via email than my in-class professors. I found it to be much more efficient to read the video lecture than watch and pause every thirty seconds.
Alum,4,"I did well at BYU. Some people say it's a hard school, and the data do show that accepted students have higher GPAs and ACT scores. I didn't think it was hard. I never had a problem with safety, but I've met people who claim they were assaulted on campus. The school has a no alcohol policy, so parties are rare but not nonexistent. I wasn't blown away by the psychology program, but I got the degree I needed."
Sophomore,4,"I haven’t taken classes online yet, but I have heard from others that it is well organized and easy to succeed."
Senior,4,"I really like the university. There are a lot of students and therefore a lot of resources for different kinds of research, majors, activities, clubs, etc. It is also nice to have a conservative, kind feel. It is definitely not a party school."
Junior,4,"All of my classes switched to remote learning in March. I took a Spanish class over zoom, but the rest of my classes were just online assignments and readings."
Junior,4,"I love how BYU creates an environment where everyone can feel comfortable and loved. Students are all very intelligent and hard-working, which can create unwanted competition."
Junior,4,Professors do their best to create an environment where students can learn and grow as much as they would attending a lecture in the classroom.
Junior,4,My experience overall has been amazing . One thing I love about BYU is that it’s always trying to incorporate a diverse opinion. Diversity is growing and I feel more at home
Junior,4,"Because of Covid, it’s been a weird yet interesting experience . All of my professors have been there for me in regards to grade, tests or lectures. I really like it ."
Freshman,4,"Most of the professors have experience with online teaching methods, and they adapted very quickly to using Zoom as that became more popular. For the teachers who don't have as much online experience, they are willing to accept help from the students to create a positive learning experience even with the challenges of remote learning."
Junior,4,"So much of my online learning experience is due to Covid, so there was a lot of teachers not used to teaching online. But they did their very best. They adapted very well. And, blended classes are really amazing."
Freshman,4,"Starting after spring break, my Classes were switched from classrooms to online due to the Covid crisis, and my professors did a great job at keeping students involved on such short notice. Some teachers broke up the class into smaller groups to encourage interaction with other students."
Alum,4,"Incredible training in my field, wonderful teachers, beautiful campus. I do wish the student body was more diverse. I loved my time there, and had many opportunities to travel and participate in activities through the school. There's also some amazing cafes on campus!"
Alum,4,"I didn't take any online classes at BYU, but I did use resources online while studying. I used dashboard and blackboard. I felt that online resources were adequate."
Sophomore,4,"My classes all switched to online halfway through the semester. It was very sudden so some teachers weren't exactly sure how to handle it. But after a week or so, things started to run more smoothly. Most of my teachers did a great job of condensing their material into the new online format. A few of them gave us way too much work in a short amount of time. We had such little time to get multiple projects/assignments done that I wasn't able to really enjoy them or learn as much as I would have liked. This was likely because many of the assignments would have been done during class and just a few would have been homework, but because it was now all homework it felt like too much. Overall though, given the circumstances, my online experiences were great."
Sophomore,4,"The University has many opportunities for all majors, as well as traditions that get students involved. There is also a national and strong community of school pride."
Freshman,4,"I, personally, have not yet taken any classes online from the University. But with COVID-19 impending on everyone's future, BYU has stepped up in a large way to help students further continue their education with as little disruption as possible. They are offering many classes online this upcoming semester, and are constantly working to improve said classes and circumstances for learning. I am excited to see how the classes will function online in the coming weeks of my enrollment."
Junior,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here. Excellent professors and campus, amazing library, and just an all around good feeling. It's not perfect, it's fairly conservative, and they've got themselves on a bit of a high horse with their requirements, but it is a good school."
Freshman,4,"Zoom and assignments are easy to follow and turn in. I'd prefer in class learning, but zoom closes the gap fairly well."
Freshman,4,I love how friendly and open the staff and faculty members are. I feel like I can go to them for help if need needed. I wish the campus was fully open for fall semester.
Junior,4,"I was worried about taking online classes, but the two I took ended up being very well set-up, easy to understand, and geared towards helping the student understand the content, instead of just a bunch of reading."
Junior,4,"Classes were well adapted for online. Some teachers struggled to implement student involvement over Zoom, especially with large classes, but on the whole they made it work. Reasonable expectations were given by making exams open-book."
Niche User,4,I have not taken online classes at byu but everything that I have heard has been fantastic. online activities and the learning expirience during the pandemic has all gone amazingly smoothly and I have been very impressed.
Senior,4,"I'm not one that prefers learning online instead of in a classroom setting, but overall the online classes are presented in an organized way."
Sophomore,4,"I like the environment and the people that come here. There is a lot of Church culture that I am not a fan of, but I really love all the genuinely good people that are here. It is easy to have a lot of fun! I wish that housing was better and that the University did not try to get you for every little thing. They charge you for things that they do not need to often. The housing is incredibly expensive and there is not much you can do about it. Management of the housing always is pretty bad, but it's truly the owners fault and they never fix anything. Overall, I love the people for the most part  and the education is fantastic."
Sophomore,4,Online learning was straightforward and professors were very open to adjusting the format of the classroom to meet needs of the students.
Junior,4,"BYU is a special school that is specifically directed towards members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints. Because of this, sometimes there is not much diversity in the school and the demographics are very limited. Though, the academics are top-notch and it is one of the best schools in the nation."
Junior,4,"Although I dislike learning online, they have been very understanding and made the transition as smooth as possible. I feel I am learning as much as circumstances will allow."
Senior,4,"The classes I took were due to Corona, some professors switched very well, others struggled. It was a fairly good experience."
Senior,4,"It is an amazing college! Like all colleges, it has some good and some bad professors. It has an amazing atmosphere!"
Sophomore,4,"Due to the Corona Virus, I have taken a few online classes. My professors have all adjusted well to this change; I know they have spent hours accomodating their original courses to fit their students' needs. I have learned a lot from these classes. Chances are, I will take another online class later in my career; BYU's requirements for online courses and material for students can be difficult, as is their on-campus classes, but it is doable and appropriate."
Freshman,4,"I have only heard about online at Brigham Young University, but many good friends who have done it have said they loved the freedom it gives them and that the professors were extremely helpful."
Freshman,4,"My online experience came about because of Covid-19. Professors and TAs were very helpful and understanding about providing new and additional resources for success. I enjoyed the online experience because I was able to access previous lectures multiple times, I could get help at any time, and because I didn't need to go around campus, I was able to get a lot more done."
Junior,4,Didn’t take classes online except for after corona shut everything down. I don’t like online but I imagine they are generally good.
Sophomore,4,"Great school for an even better price! Amazing professors and staff throughout campus! The whole atmosphere of the school is indescribable, but amazing in every way! The honor code is very restricting to students, and can be severely misinterpreted at times. However, the overall prestige and beauty of the school makes up for its strict rule book."
Junior,2,"I don't think it's a bad school, but trying to work part time and go here is impossible. If you're trying to pay for your own school and get good grades... Think again. Grades or pay rent take your pick. The teachers all assign work like their class is the only one you take and it's annoying as heck. Sorry I wasn't a valedictorian and want to have friends. I stay at the library for 8 hours and still have 2 hours of homework left to do when I get home. I can't learn when I'm too stressed out to even breathe. The tuition is nice though."
Alum,2,"I had always dreamed to go to BYU. My parents both went here and had an amazing experience. I would say that my freshman year was a good year. BYU has a great environment and I absolutely loved my dorm roommates and on-campus job. After returning from a 18-month church mission, BYU was just not the same. It tries so hard to act like and Ivy League school. It pushed students to perfectionism and insanity. I did appreciate the spiritual aspect of attending, but that was about it. About half my professors were genuine and helpful. But the comparison and outrageous expectations made it so I did not feel welcome, capable, or happy while attending. I always thought I'd send my children there one day, but I am hoping to send them somewhere else after the experience I had."
Freshman,2,"Do not come here if you are not LDS. It is kind of a difficult social environment due to the fact that most activities are church based. Also, if you are looking for diversity, BYU is not the place for you. Provo, the town where BYU is, has been rated the least diverse city for like the last ten years."
Sophomore,2,"Run by the LDS church, teaches church history inaccurately and in a skewed light.  Culture of shame and conformity, a toxic environment."
Niche User,2,"Brigham Young University is a rigorous academic institution that has all the resources to provide its students with an excellent university experience but doesn't utilize them. There are constant issues of homophobia, racism, sexism, religious discrimination, and so on and so forth that horrify students and are ignored by administration. The Honor Code Office is a terror force focused on punishing students for minute mistakes. There is no room for any failures, whether spiritual, academic, or healthwise.  I cannot think of a more hostile environment to try to receive an education."
Alum,2,"Made some good friends at BYU. Also enjoyed some of my classes. Experienced a lot of racism - oftentimes not malicious, just naive (microaggressions). Graduated with a self-esteem problem over my ethnicity that took years to heal from. This was in some way aggravated by professors who talked about race in class in harmful ways (not intentionally - but out of lack of knowledge). Also experienced a lot of microaggressions from classmates and students who were strangers to me. Religious environment is both uplifting and harmful (harmful because causes a culture of judgement).  However the degree itself has helped me a great deal with my career and I am grateful for it. Also grateful that I even had the opportunity to go to college. The library is wonderful - one of the best university libraries in the country."
Freshman,2,"I didn't like BYU at all. everyone there is super judgemental, the classes are big, and there isn't any one-on-one time with the teacher. There are also a lot a cams that take place here, so campus is always crowded with little kids and teenagers."
Senior,2,"The professors are kind and open minded that I had, if you are liberal, lgbtq, a poc or just in general dissenting in opinion from a mainstream lds mentality, I would caution you away. Not worth the trauma."
Junior,2,Awful. Sexist. Bad weather. Bad teachers. Bad school policies. Mean students. Please get me out of here. Religion classes are needlessly hard and take the spirit out of the gospel. If you aren't on board with a Trump presidency you will not be welcome with open arms.
College Senior,2,I don't know about Greek life
College Freshman,2,"There is very little diversity on campus. This goes for race (almost exclusively white), political beliefs (almost exclusively conservative), religion (almost exclusively Mormon), and sexual orientation (almost exclusively heterosexual)."
College Freshman,2,"The school in generally is sanitary; I see janitors everywhere, but their food and handling license at the BYU Cremery should be suspended. I got horror stories from my friend that worked there. And I was food poisoned twice by their daily-made products."
College Junior,2,"When there is a sporting event plan on not being able to park anywhere on campus for your classes that day, especially later in the day. So you better just get dropped off, also if you don't absolutely have to don't go anywhere on those days because the entire city is jam packed due to the sporting event."
College Sophomore,2,We don't really have one as far as I know. I'm not positive though.
College Sophomore,2,"I was at a surprise pep rally in the library on campus at the end of last semester, the football players were the opposite of excited and enthused and preferred to slap people rudely in the face with free t-shirts that actually motivate students. personally since then I have become an anti BYU sports fan due to that scenario and many others that have occured."
College Sophomore,2,There isnt a whole lot of diversity
College Sophomore,2,There isn't really any greek life at BYU...
College Student,2,Hard to find something comparable to the on-campus dorms.
College Freshman,2,"Due to VERY limited availability of on-campus housing, everyone who is not a freshman has to live off-campus.This makes BYU feel like way less of a community and it's hard because the approved off-campus housing is disgusting and if you want to live somewhere clean and nice it's very, very pricey."
College Freshman,2,Little party scene. Mostly off campus.
College Sophomore,2,I just don't know what is available to me. I wish I had someone who worked a little closer with me to help me figure things out. I am the first one to go to college in my family and I really don't know how to work the system and play the game.
College Junior,2,"There are some really great facilities for the official athletes, but for other students the facilities are old, and overcrowded."
College Freshman,2,"I tried to get financial aid, but am still working on getting anything to help me pay for school. It's tough."
College Freshman,2,BYU is definitely not a party school if you're looking to party look somewhere else.
College Freshman,2,Getting a scholarship here is quite hard. Tuition is cheaper than other places but getting a scholarship is beastly
College Freshman,2,Lots of cookie cutter Mormons. Lots and lots and lots. There is a USGA (pretty much a Gay Straight Alliance) that is super big on campus. I love seeing even just a little bit of diversity in that way. My roommates and I used to compare how many black people we saw on campus each day because there were so few.
College Sophomore,2,nothing fun to do here.
College Junior,2,"BYU is relatively cheap, which is really nice, but the financial aid is extremely competitive. I feel like people who really need it don't always get it, even if they have good grades... it's the people who came in as valedictorians of their high school and freak out if they get a B. Many of these students don't need the financial aid, but end up getting it anyways."
College Sophomore,2,"'Parties' are not so much parties, usually. 'Dessert party' etc. Maybe there are good parties out there but I've never been to one. I usually study or chill with a smaller group of friends instead."
College Freshman,2,It is tough getting any type of reasonable normal housing. It feels like everything is really nice or really bad. No middle ground.
College Freshman,2,I didn't receive anything. It is hard to get scholarships.
College Freshman,2,There is no party seen. Enough said.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking.... don't get me started. I wish they would build a parking garage to deal with the number or cars parked on the street. It's a hazard, especially with the large ditches (trenches) near the edge of the streets. There needs to be some sort of parking permit system where you can have a guaranteed spot and not have to worry about walking an extra 15 minutes to campus."
College Freshman,2,"It is near impossible to get an academic scholarship here, but the school is so cheap that it doesn't bother me."
College Freshman,2,I haven't found a party that has been super fun yet
College Freshman,2,"From what I know, everything is falling apart. I've been to a few friends' places, and it's always cold and dirty, and it makes me not want to live in Provo."
College Freshman,2,"Since this is a college town, most of the food places hire college students. They obviously don't care about anything, so the quality of your food suffers for it. Not fair, huh? Also everywhere is crowded. It's the worst."
College Freshman,2,Students are very religious and mostly closed minded. If you are coming to school for a purely academic experience then this is the place for you. If you want to get married then this is the place for you. The dating scene is huge. The social life however is very different from most other colleges. There is no drinking. There is a curfew. There is a dress code. If you are not prepared to follow these rules then the social life will be really hard.
College Freshman,2,There's the honor code. If you don't know about the honor code you better look it up or you're in trouble (unless you're mormon in which case you probably already do all that stuff anyways.) But people aren't breathing down your neck so you could get away with a lot if you wanted too. Except for visiting hours in the dorms. Those are really enforced and at Helaman halls it's really inconvenient.
College Junior,2,I do not really even know what is meant by the questions asked haha.
College Senior,2,"People assume they're safe here because of the general conservative Mormon population, so when you have an actual issue nobody takes it seriously. Crime and safety issues are here, but nobody reports or talks about them seriously."
College Senior,2,"I didn't live on campus housing because I got here on my sophomore year. Only freshman live on campus housing and I heard it is pretty expensive for just a shared room without kitchen and much comfort. However, there are new on campus housing been built and becoming available. I guess it will be better in a few years."
College Senior,2,"I think our campus, specially because of its religious beliefs( word of wisdom), should have more availability of healthy food options. At the food-court we only have one restaurant that offers salad options, but it is extremely expensive. The other (cheaper) restaurants have very oily food, that I am not sure if it is safe to eat. Vending machines only have a few options of healthy snacks. A lot of people tend do get bigger after their freshman year here.

When it comes to safety, we just had a series of sexual assaults from one of the track team guys. However, I feel safer at BYU then other campus."
College Senior,2,"I wish there were more help available to students besides the school scholarship. I am a great student but scholarships here are over the top competitive since the school is already known by having a low tuition with great services. So, a lot of low income students compete for the same scholarship."
College Freshman,2,Very tame but you can go off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone signs an honor code prior to attending, which lays out a long list of rules that all students are expected to follow both on and off-campus (even when they go home for the summer). It includes stuff like absolutely NO drinking, smoking, drugs, sex, and a strict curfew. No one is allowed to have a member of the opposite gender in their bedroom at any time, and they're supposed to be out of your apartment by midnight. On-campus it's extremely difficult to get around any of these rules. Off-campus it's a bit easier since there aren't RA's constantly supervising you, but if you get caught doing any of that stuff you can get kicked out of school. Some people get reported and are let off easy, some are immediately expelled. It depends on where you live. It's the kind of thing that's great if you're extremely religious, but can be extremely stifling for any students who want to experiment with anything that's against the honor code."
College Sophomore,2,Cost of living seems too high. An apartment of 6 guys will be as much as 2000 a month!
Recent Alumnus,2,In the 1950s it was good.
College Sophomore,2,They should have more choices and student discounts.
College Senior,2,The schools so competitive. I still need financial aid and can't find any.
College Junior,2,We don't really participate in the night life.
College Sophomore,2,"BYU, due to the strict honor code that bans all drugs and alcohol, as well as initiating a strict curfew, doesn't have much of a party scene. However, there are still plenty of campus events going on that it isn't difficult to find something to do."
College Student,2,"Because BYU is a private religious school, there is a great lack of diversity regarding religion, sexual orientation and general beliefs. BYU does, however, make an effort to vary race and ethnicity and provide an accepting atmosphere in that regard."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There isn't much ethnic, economic, political, religious, or sexual orientation diversity that I have seen."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much diversity here. People from a different cultural background might experience a big cultural shock.
College Senior,2,I love BYU but there is little to no diversity.
College Freshman,2,I always park my car at the apartment that I'm renting and walk to school because parking is pretty hard to find.
College Sophomore,2,Its way far out from campus
College Junior,2,"A few years ago they moved my major to the business school and now I feel like over half the classes I'm required to take have nothing to do with what I'm planning on going into. In total I only have to take 5 classes for my major specially and I think that is ridiculous. The major classes aren't a lot of work, they're fantastic, but the business classes require a lot of effort. Internships are mandatory and volunteer hours are mandatory, which is nice, and like 98% of students end up passing the certification exam."
College Freshman,2,"This is not a party city. There are some, but not many"
Niche User,1,"I actually didn't take any classes online, I took summer courses in person for four years. I know, pretty crazy right?"
Niche User,1,"Brigham Young University, where do I begin? For starters, I have never seen a private institution make a statement for publicity and then rescind that same statement as quickly as BYU did about their stance on LGBTQ relationships on campus. Then there is the whole honor code, which is not only outdated and sexist, it's a safety net to free the school from accountability whenever anything goes wrong. While we're here let's talk about how BYU is ""allegedly"" accepting of everyone, however, the disgusting VAST white majority of students who barely put in the work to get into the school treats the minority group of students TERRIBLY, even though the ethnic population of the school worked their butts off just trying to be considered for admissions. My overall experience with BYU is that BYU isn't amazing or a safe haven for anyone who isn't white or Mormon."
Sophomore,1,"It was incredibly hard to take classes online. I hated that we paid the same amount for terrible learning. I am not truly learning anything. The teachers try their best, but it is not their fault. The school should have done better. The housing tried to make it nearly impossible to let students out of their contracts, it was horrible."
Alum,1,"Don't make the mistake of coming here. The suicide rate is appalling, with next to no help or support from the University. Their acceptance and expectation for students to blackmail each other is short of criminal and - that was me keeping religion out of it. If you're looking for Diversity or a place to expand your knowledge and concept of the world, this is not the place for you."
College Freshman,1,We don't have a Greek life at Brigham Young University.
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is basically nonexistent here. I haven't heard of a fraternity yet...
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life
College Junior,1,No Greek Life. Instead there are lots of clubs!
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek Life............................
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have it so I""m not sure how it is to be honest."
College Sophomore,1,"Uh, we don't have Greek life at BYU.  We don't have frats or sororities either.  There are honor societies and tons of clubs to join though."
College Freshman,1,As far as I know the Greek life on my college campus does not exist.
College Junior,1,There isn't Greek Life here.
College Junior,1,We don't have greek life.
College Sophomore,1,We have no Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have any sororities or fraternities.
College Freshman,1,"BYU has a low party atmosphere (party meaning the traditional sense with beer and drugs and sex). BYU has fun, clean gatherings where students get together and have fun and enjoy themselves without drugs and alcohol. Because these social scenes are not considered the usual party scene, I would say that BYU has a horrible party scene, but in my opinion, that is awesome. I am against the consumption of beer and alcohol, so anything where that is the normality is not good in my opinion."
College Freshman,1,I personally don't even know what this is so it's possible BYU doesn't even have one.
College Freshman,1,Greek life is not available here
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life
College Freshman,1,Not a university to come to for a fraternity/sorority.
College Student,1,"There is no greek life at byu, fraternities and sororities are not allowed."
College Freshman,1,HAHAHAHAHAHA!   BYU DOESN'T HAVE FRATS AND SORORITIES!!
College Sophomore,1,BYU doesn't participate in Greek life or fraternity and sororities. (And I'm an international student so I really don't know what any of these things are?)
College Junior,1,We don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,"I attend a religious school where drinking and clubbing is not only frowned upon, but also against our honor code. While there is no ""Greek Life"" here, there are so many fun, clean, and friendly oriented student activities that make up for it. I would not have it change one bit."
College Senior,1,"I do not have an adequate option listed above.  Greek life is non existent at my school. As a private religious school, my school does not allow Greek life. I have not felt like this was a great loss to the experience I hoped to have in college.  Other clubs and professional organizations on campus help meet varied student needs and interests."
College Sophomore,1,Not a very big night life
College Freshman,1,No Greek Life at BYU
College Sophomore,1,"There are no fraternities or sororities on campus, which allows all students to feel included in the general whole of the University."
College Student,1,We don't have fraternities or sororities
College Sophomore,1,"So..BYU doesn't have Greek life...

aka: It is difficult to get into because it is impossible.

It is the worst...because there is none? Or maybe that makes it the best? I don't really know...I've never experienced it, so it doesn't really effect me."
College Sophomore,1,The school is not lenient at all on these types of things. I know we signed the honor code but still...
College Freshman,1,There is none because of the Honor Code. Partying will get you kicked out of school
College Freshman,1,"I'm never going to marry someone from here, let alone date."
College Freshman,1,THEY'RE ALL SO LAME!!! Never go to the parties.
College Senior,1,There are no sororities or fraternities at BYU.
College Junior,1,"Not too many parties in this area, you will find something to do with your ward and things"
College Senior,1,There are only white blonde people here.
College Senior,1,School policies are too strict.
College Senior,1,It's the cheapest college housing you could ask for.
College Senior,1,Worst. Party. Scene. In. The. World.
College Senior,1,"Utah is full of repetitious franchises. If you find a nice little locally-owned place you like, it will probably close down in a few months because college students are cheap."
College Sophomore,1,"I do not know of many, if any, Greeks or sororities/fraternities..."
College Sophomore,1,"I can't get financial aid cause my dad has such a high salary.  But what they don't consider is that there are 11 kids in my family and my parents are trying to help each of their kids but there is only so much they can do. They can't afford to support us all so I pay for housing, books, food, clothing, etc. by myself.  Its very difficult and stressful."
College Junior,1,There is no greek life here at Brigham Young University
College Sophomore,1,Dont even know what it is
College Junior,1,We don't really have a Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"There aren't any fraternities or ""Greeks"" on campus as far as I know."
College Junior,1,No party scene at all.
Recent Alumnus,1,It's a gosh darn racket. Have your parents sign a waiver and live outside the purity ring. You'll pay about 1/2 the price and get twice the room.
College Junior,1,no greek life at this school
College Junior,1,"There is basically no real party scene out in the open. There are some there, but they are secret, since you could get kicked out of school for that kind of partying."
College Junior,1,"Ya, we're all basically the same."
College Junior,1,"There is a joke on campus that the most diverse things on campus are the plants. The stereotype is white, blond, Republican, and pretty well off money-wise. It is hard for minorities to feel accepted sometimes. Most people keep their sexual orientation to private to avoid being ostracized. Being white is the shared trait more than being Mormon."
College Senior,1,The parking is horrible. There is no where is for students to park and constantly empty faculty lots.
College Senior,1,There are no sororities or fraternities.
College Sophomore,1,There aren't enough parking spots allocated to students
College Sophomore,1,The visitation rules for the dorms are ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,There is virtually no drug use at BYU.

Alum,5,Thankfully everyone was attentive and worked with us to provide an experience similar to a classroom setting.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Sarah Lawrence. Some of the perks include an open curriculum, inclusivity on campus, proximity to NYC, and the small tight knit community. Most students live on campus and have an academic advisor for their time at SLC. I feel confident with the resources on campus to help not only with my education and academic career but also for my occupation and career beyond SLC."
Senior,5,"Sarah Lawrence is a unique school. It gives students a chance to work very closely one on one with their professors, and build meaningful relationships with them. I know that at school I have multiple professors that I can go to for guidance and support and they will always be there for me. I’ve been able to explore all my passions and interests at Sarah lawrence, and the structure of the educational system has encouraged me to do that. I feel that I’ve learned many practical skills while also studying many abstract and theoretical concepts, and that I’ve had a very well rounded education. Sarah Lawrence students are intelligent, passionate, And meaningful when they approach their work and their communities they build on campus. One of the biggest struggles on campus is the economic divide however. There’s a pretty large gap between the students who can afford to pay full tuition and those who are on scholarship, and it can lead to some socially isolating situations."
Senior,5,"This past semester we all had to move online. However Sarah Lawrence has always been a school that has been adept at thinking out of the box. So while there was a steep learning curve, the small class sizes made it so that my professors were able to check in and meet with me one on one so we could be on the same page about the situation I was in, and how I was doing, and how that was affecting my work. The school has prioritized maintaining the quality of its education with the move to online schooling due to COVID, and while there has been struggle and it’s not the same as being on campus, I still feel that I have been able to take advantage of the intimate learning environments that SLC offers."
Senior,5,"Online learning worked really well because of our small seminar-style classes and lectures. Professors checked in consistently about work and personal life, and the school offered many resources for students."
Senior,5,"The Open Curriculum has provided me with so many opportunities I wouldn’t have at a traditional college. I’ve been able to connect with faculty and professionals in the dance program, learn from award-winning professors, and even get my Bachelor's and Master’s in 5 years!"
Junior,5,"The seminar class style was easily transferable to an online setting. My classes were just as engaging as before, and I felt I was getting the same quality of instruction from my professor despite the circumstances."
Junior,5,"A welcoming community that is full of passionate, creative, and intelligent students and professors. An incredible college - I am very glad I am an SLC student."
Alum,5,I loved my experience at Sarah Lawrence College!  It prepared me really well for the career field I plan on pursuing.
Alum,5,"My experience at SLC was invaluable.  The professors and staff were passionate, highly experienced, and very creative in their approach to students, teaching and developing coursework.   I wished the student body had been more ethnically and economically diverse.  But the college did prioritize programs, organizations, and departments committed and dedicated to being inclusive.  I would not have attended any other college."
Senior,5,Amazing for film students. You get to use industry-standard equipment from your first year at the college. Professors have prior experience in the field and care about you and your work.  Being able to sculpt my education in any way I want has been wonderful. One doesn't have to stick to one particular area of study.
Sophomore,5,"SLC offers an incredibly hands on education, and the unique experience of being able to truly choose what you study. You can shape your own course of education rather than fill strict requirements, and this allows you to take classes in many different subjects and become skilled in multiple areas."
Senior,5,"I love Sarah Lawrence College. The campus is beautiful, the faculty is incredible, the classes were challenging but rewarding, and I loved the group of friends I made here. I was given so many opportunities because I went to school here, including multiple internships, the ability to graduate a year early and the chance to study abroad at Oxford University. The athletics are average, and this isn't the school you'd want to go to for partying. It's everything a small liberal arts college is stereotyped to be, and your experience here is really what you make of it. As a student of color, the student body was a little alienating at times (being 70% white) so I spent many weekends on the comfy couches of Common Ground - the school's space for racial minorities. Overall, however, I felt like I truly belonged here. Maybe you will too."
Junior,5,"An outstanding educational experience. The classes are small, seminar-type sessions so the unprepared have no place to hide. Heavy emphasis on discussion and writing, on marshalling facts and honing arguments. Sarah Lawrence will mold you into an exceptional thinker and communicator."
Freshman,5,"Sarah Lawrence College strives to connect with each and every individual student and prospective student. Upon receiving my acceptance letter, my heart was warmed to see a handwritten note on the bottom quoting the first sentence of my college essay and expressing excitement for me to join the community. When I received an invitation to an accepted students day, it was made personal by talking about my major and hometown. The small class sizes and ""don"" (mentor) system crystalize how valued the individual student is at Sarah Lawrence. You are a name not a number!"
Sophomore,5,Exactly the college experience I've wanted! Small school with great professors and a great way of teaching.
Sophomore,5,"Sarah Lawrence is a thriving community that focuses its attention to its students' academic careers. The unique style of education makes this school the individualistic college that it is. With one on one attention available in almost every class, learning becomes a different kind of challenge than it would be at other schools. rather than students finding challenge in a professor who does not/cannot give enough attention to the students, they find challenge with making decisions on their own education. Being able to study what the student wants to study is truly a gift. the social scene reflects this education in that it is full of different individuals who look out for each other and enjoy one another's company. Finding friends is not a challenge and new friendships will certainly blossom even further when the Barbara Walters Campus Center opens in 2019."
Graduate Student,5,"I enjoy the wide range of courses students can select from, in addition to the student-to-professor ratio. It makes for closer relationships where professors can give better criticisms on your work."
Niche User,5,Sarah Lawrence is a great college and you will have a great experience. It is a Liberal arts school that is located right out side of the city. It is located in a very rich town and the campus is really nice for the most part. Our academics are great. There are academic focuses instead of majors so you will be able to select a wide variety of classes. Some people do go out to the sports games and there is also an okay party scene depending on what you make of it. Honestly you could have parties every night but there are usually good parties Thursday-saturday. There are no frats but they are normally thrown in houses on campus. If you don't feel like partying on campus you could just take a 30 minute train ride right into the city and go to the clubs or bars. They also have a unique learning style. There is usually no more than 15 kids in a class sitting at a round table unless it is a lecture hall. Also the food it pretty good as well.
Alum,5,"SLC provides an intimate and personalized education, and forces you to engage with your studies. Students that need structure, external motivation, or sports/Greek social life may not be a fit. But if you take advantage it, the access to professors will allow you to learn much more than you can at big schools. For example, I took two years of beginning French at SLC and then placed into graduate-level courses. This was because I was forced to speak French one-on-one with my professor from the first day of class. I also improved my writing and analytical skills, key in my career (law). The school's name recognition also gave me a leg up professionally. Above all, I got confidence to find my own way intellectually and personally, knowing that failure and success are both part of a fulfilling life.  The school’s slogan used to be “you are different, so are we”; it certainly is. For intellectual adventurers who want to find their own path, Sadie Lou is a special place."
Sophomore,5,I love it here so much! I transferred from a big university and much prefer the Sarah Lawerence culture. I'm thankful I found home here.
Sophomore,5,"There is no education like Sarah Lawrence College, if you take the time to do the work in classes and to talk to your professors you will succeed in the school and greatly expand your understanding of the world. It is everything I wanted in a school."
Senior,5,"Sarah Lawrence College has a unique education system that consists of thirds, or three subjects a year. However, there are music, dance, and theater thirds that comprise of components that make up that third. Also, instead of final exams, most classes have conference papers, which are papers ranging from 20-50 pages on an independently researched topic in relation to the class. The professors here are incredible and despite the small size of the college, there are a lot of opportunities offered that a lot of bigger universities don't even have. It's a great place if you're used to having more independence as it is not a very structured school. However, if you're good with a more independent study feel, are open-minded, and love to write, this is the place to be."
Senior,5,"If reading and thinking and writing and arguing is your thing, Sarah Lawrence may be your college. As I consider my years here, I'm inclined to say that this place has moulded me in a way I once would have scarcely imagined possible. I've been mentored by my professors, made friends for life, and the school's amazing New York City network has offered me internship opportunities that would be the envy of anyone enrolled any institution of higher learning.

SLC doesn't play the college ranking game and so the ranking gods punish it accordingly. But don't be fooled. This place is amazing. If you're the right fit for it, and it's the right fit for you, you won't get a better education anywhere, one that will leave you incredibly well-equipped for grad school, for life, for anything.

P.S. If you're a heterosexual male, btw, SLC could be a particularly savvy choice. Just sayin'...  ;-)"
Sophomore,5,"It's a great academic environment which makes it worth the price. Sarah Lawrence is a great place as it allows students to study a variety of topics without having to declare a major. The donning system is extremely beneficial and allows for the close interactions with professors, which is very unique."
College Sophomore,5,Courses are always interesting and proffesors are always approachable
College Sophomore,5,I love SLC because of the insane amount of opportunities you get as an undergraduate that you would otherwise have to wait until graduate school to get. Things like research fellowships with professors and internships in the city make building up a resume so easy.
College Freshman,5,SO many SLC graduates have their own wikipedia pages. One will most likely get a job before one even graduates.
College Freshman,5,"The academics at SLC are incredible. You have to be very self-motivated, and if you're not you'll basically just flounder and leave with nothing to offer, but if you're looking to truly learn as much as you can about a variety of topics that you couldn't study anywhere else, this is the place. Professors, with only a few exceptions, are incredibly passionate and dedicated. Almost all classes are small seminars. There is a lecture requirement, but even lectures are typically only around 50 students and include biweekly smaller group meetings with the professor. For seminars, you complete a conference project for each course, which involves meeting with the professor every other week and developing an intensive research project related to the course but incorporating other interests. This typically culminates in a big research paper, but I've also seen projects range from an interpretive dance about plants to the design of a full anti-bullying course for elementary schoolers. Long story short, you really get to know and develop relationships with professors, and can explore pretty much anything you want to academically."

College Junior,5,"The academics at SLC are unbeatable. I am constantly amazed at both the prolific nature of our faculty, but also their passion for the style of teaching at SLC, their students, and their subjects. 

A wide variety of courses is offered, and many times in subjects that are very unusual, past courses I've seen offered include Jewish Mysticism, The History of Food, Steampunk Psychics, and many more. 

The best parts of the Sarah Lawrence model in my opinion is tied between the small seminar approach (15 students and a prof, max.) and conference work. Conference work is the second piece of each course (excluding lectures). It is an independent research project under the guidance of the professor, on a topic of your choice relating to the subject of the course. Typically these are 20+ paper pages per course, but can also take other forms, depending on the flexibility of the teacher. 

There are areas I wish Sarah Lawrence offered more courses in, but with conference work I feel that I can easily tie in any other interests into the existing curriculum."
College Freshman,5,"I believe Sarah Lawrence has the best professors in the world. Their dedication and passion for what they teach is infectious, they do all they can to help you succeed but also to push you out of your comfort zone, and they are willing to act as mentors and offer advice for things both involving coursework and not."
College Junior,5,This school is unique because it allows you to put yourself in uncomfortable situations in order to push your boundaries and learn as much as possible.
College Freshman,5,"I really have enjoyed myself here so far! The academics are really worth it and there are opportunities if you are willing to go out and look! The social environment isn't the best, but there are ways to meet people and things work out in the end!"
College Junior,5,"Sarah Lawrence is very close to New York City. There are two train stations close to the school, both within walking distance. The school also runs a shuttle to the Bronxville train station starting around 5pm. Many students go into the city often during the weekend. The close proximity to the city is something that brings a lot of students to the school."
College Sophomore,5,"The academics here are amazing. Each professor is dedicated to your learning. It all depends on whether or not you can handle a non traditional style of learning. We only take 3 classes a semester, unless you're a third, but these 3 classes require a lot, yet manageable, of work. Each class is a concentration in that field, except most sciences, so you're taking ""English 101"" you're taking ""Latin American Literature in the 20th Century""."
College Senior,5,"A school adage is gay before May and man is that accurate. Infer what you will, but this is rumored to be the best lesbian college in the country. Straight males, its a number game my friends. If you know what's good for you, matriculate here now!"
College Junior,5,"The Conference System is based on the Oxford Tutorial Model. Each class has two components: the communal class and coursework, and then an independent project you work on during the semester independently with the professor."
College Junior,5,"The academics are, hands-down, the reason people come to Sarah Lawrence. The faculty is one-of-a-kind and rated the best in the country by the Princeton Review."
College Freshman,5,a lot of spaces for parking. it is one of the best things.
College Freshman,5,"challenging and inspiring i would say. Professors are the best. you get attention, and you need to work hard."
College Sophomore,5,The teachers. The faculty here can't compare to any other school in the world.
College Sophomore,5,"I'm so glad to be studying here. We don't have majors, so it gives me the freedom of focusing on the many things I like to do, and still try new things when I have the time in my schedule. I plan on becoming an author, and the fiction workshop are great (if you really put in the effort). I'm also interesting in languages, and I love that we have tutorials outside of class, conferences with teachers, and even language tables to practice during lunch. I would definitely do it all over again, because you can't get this kind of education anywhere else."
College Sophomore,5,"The most important criteria for admission is knowing what you want. This doesn't mean knowing what you want to be, or knowing which career path you'll choose, but knowing the things you like, don't like, and being open to trying new things.  Really, just be yourself."
College Sophomore,5,"Academics here are amazing, psych is amazing, the professors are so great, the workload is a lot, curriculum is interesting and personalized, facilities are good enough."
College Sophomore,5,"The psych faculty is amazing, they're all very, very smart, very helpful and kind, and just great.  I've had a fabulous experience in the psych department.  Internships and jobs are more of an independent process."
College Freshman,5,"If you consider ""off-campus"" to be New York City, aka a 30 minute train ride away, then you obviously have an infinite amount of options. A lot of people order take-out or go into Bronxville and Yonkers if they want something closer to campus though and there are some really nice options, with a few malls close by and downtown Bronxville has a nice organic market and a few good restaurants."
College Freshman,5,Nothing else compares to the academics presents at SLC
College Freshman,5,"In terms of academics you will not receive more individual attention and personal growth at any other school. In my first year I wrote a grant and instituted a now active community program. This would not be possible at another school, usually students are not allowed such liberty until entering graduate school."
College Freshman,5,"You are allowed to explore. Sarah Lawrence does not have majors, but rather concentrations. This promotes the acquiring of a multiude of skills rather than the sterotypical college graduate--only knowledge in one area (ie. a science major with no empathy or information on policies or social aspects."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love that Sarah Lawrence does not have majors. It is such a unique approach to education and I find that I am really encouraged to explore so many things that I would never think of taking if I had strict requirements. I am a dance ""third,"" which means a third of my time is devoted to dance (you can also take a third in theater, visual arts, or music). It's a similar system to a major except you dedicate a lot of time to your academic classes as well. The system doesn't really work well for people who want to focus on one thing. The typical Sarah Lawrence student has a schedule that goes something like this: they're taking theater classes, a queer studies course, a computer science course and they're in the burlesque club."
College Freshman,5,"It's the best. We do have the number 1 faculty in the country. You can definitely slack off if you really want to, but the teachers here encourage you to go beyond the normal course load to really immerse yourself in the topic. We have the best teachers in the country and they will make you work hard, but you will realize that you've learned so much more than if they hadn't."
College Freshman,5,"Sarah Lawrence is basically in Manhattan. That is to say the college has only 20 minutes drive and 30 minutes train to the great New York City. That is pretty enough for a college student. We got shuttle bus as well. Although I never took since I like running and walking, my friends say the shuttle is pretty good.  "
College Junior,5,"Sarah Lawrence sole bachelor's degree is a Liberal Arts degree. But this is no hindrance. Most companies in NYC, especially those in visual and creative arts, and even those in business and economics, love SLC students who come from multidimensional educational backgrounds. For example, I've studied computer science and nanotechnology while also studying fiction, public policy, screenwriting, and film production. I've been able to apply my science knowledge to some of my writing pieces and I've also applied my knowledge of public policy to a volunteer program I work at where I teach incarcerated youth how to write poetry. The workload is tough, but it's not overwhelming. The class registration process is a bit hectic and can be frustrating, but the sheer number of amazing classes offered usually counters that. In general, this college offers you an amazing academic opportunity. The professors are brighter than most and the campus has an engaging intellectual atmosphere. If you're looking for an institution with rigorous academics and the freedom to pursue any or all fields without limitations (such as the ability to go all four years without taking a math course), then SLC is the place for you. "
College Junior,5,"I love the set-up of the academics here, it's so liberating in comparison to so many other schools, where you are restricted to classes within your major. The only downside is that because anyone can take any class (except for advance level ones of course) you can end up getting bumped from a class that really fascinates you (seminars are capped at 15 people). However, professors tend to offer the same classes every couple of years. Additionally, if you get bumped from something you're really passionate about, you can audit it."
College Sophomore,5,All facilities are rather small and it can feel crowded. There's hardly a place to just be by yourself
College Freshman,5,"there is a shuttle that will take you to the train station and to trader joes along with driving people around campus. the train is also walking distance, very close and very accessible, and well priced. if you call a taci they are usually there in ten minutes. also zip cars are available and very easy to access."
College Sophomore,5,"I was awarded a great academic scholarship, and I was given a lot of gift aid. Sarah Lawrence devotes an exceptional amount of its funds toward getting high-need students the help they need to stay at such a great school where they can grow— an environment that other schools can't provide."
College Freshman,5,"Even in substance-free housing, people drink and smoke, which is a bit unfortunate if you want to be sub-free. People smoke pot everywhere, and you can see drug deals in the cafeteria late at night. The campus security vans drive around at night, but as long as you aren't swigging from a bottle, they don't say anything. If you have a problem with something, they're really nice and helpful, but they don't take initiative in cracking down."
College Junior,5,"So Much Personal Attention, Rigorous, Deep, Integrative. The academics are the best part about the college. The professors here are really top notch. I have yet to have a negative experience with the professors I've had, and many of them have become friends of mine and people who have greatly inspired me and pushed me to look deeper into my studies. It's the reason why I chose this school of all the ones I was accepted to. Writing is a huge part of the curriculum, another plus for me, and there's a lot of room to learn about different writing styles and different applications. From poetry to research papers to non-fiction, there are professors here who are well-trained and well-respected in their academic seat. 

If you're looking to just get by without participating much in the classroom, then this is not the place for you. Students here are passionate about their work, and as a whole I feel confident saying that we really dive into our work and really enjoy learning."
Junior,4,"Sarah Lawrence was my first choice school when I was applying to colleges, and I've had a wonderful time there. Due to its open curriculum, in the past two years I've taken classes on religion in Japan, Hinduism, Japanese, Medieval literature, and creative writing. I wish I was able to take more classes in a term, but the conference project model has also given me the chance to write extended research papers on topics that I'm passionate about."
Senior,4,"I love Sarah Lawrence's small classes, engaging and caring faculty, and the ability to design your own education/be in control of your undergrad experience. At SLC, you have the opportunity to conduct your own original research and creative work at a grad level during your undergrad. I feel more prepared for any grad program than I think I would had I gone elsewhere.

SLC has a history of underserving its students because of lack of funding. This is particularly salient for students of color and is an issue across higher education institutions. I would like to see the administration engage with the student body and make real changes to the structures in place at the school surrounding food insecurity and unequal access to resources. 

SLC students are politically engaged and community oriented while also being passionate about studies and individually motivated. The student body tries to support each other in ways the admin can or does not. Being an SLC student is a special thing."
Sophomore,4,Very good! The transition to online was difficult for both faculty and students but overall all professors and admin were considerate to these difficulties. They offered online employment options for students as well.
Sophomore,4,"The class sizes are fantastic, you won't get a better 1-on-1 experience with professors anywhere else and the connections you form with your peers from in depth discussions are unparalleled. Sarah Lawrence has the best professors and creative, community oriented, and intellectually curious students."
Junior,4,"I am entering my third year at Sarah Lawrence, and I have been pleased with my experience. I am a STEM student and an athlete, so I am not your typical SLC student. I am also participating in the 3/2 engineering program with Columbia. With that said, I still feel like I fit into the liberal arts and science. Because of our open curriculum, the students at SLC are very passionate about their interests. Being able to pick your classes makes everyone very excited about what they are learning. For our seminar classes (90% of our courses) you have something called conference work. It is an independent study/project you work on during the semester guided by your professor. These projects can be very analytical, like a research paper or more creative, like computer programs that do high-level math calculations. When you are through with SLC, you have many of these projects pilled up, and they are a great addition to your resume. Lastly, I would like to say that the professors are great."
Junior,4,"I am proud of the professors I had for spring 2020 in being able to change their courses to an online version in a week. SLC is known for its interactive and collaborative courses because of our small class sizes. It was not an easy adjustment, but I feel like I still learned all the material necessary. I did have three labs, which were the most difficult to replicate in an online version. But my professors were very creative specifically for physics. Merideth Frey took videos of data that we would watch and collect at home before the faculty was not allowed back on campus. If she did not have a video, she found interactive websites and youtube videos for us to simulate a lab or collect data. Jim Marshall, my comp sci prof, always made himself available to answer questions or go through in detail homework and labs. It was a long semester, but I believe the professors did everything they could to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"My online experience at SLC was pretty good, considering the quick adjustment to everything moving online. All of my professors were very understanding of the difficult adjustment, and offered time in class to discuss how we were feeling. I My course work was well suitable for the online environment, and I still felt like I got a lot out of my classes. Being online was not the same as being in person, and at times felt isolating, but the immense support systems that are in place for students at SLC really helped me!"
Sophomore,4,"Sarah Lawrence College is such an amazing place with caring students and professors. All faculty want you to succeed and are there to help you on your way! It is very welcoming and has a close knit bond between students. I have learned so many important life skills (like how to write about anything) that I will always remember. Overall, Sarah Lawrence has changed my life!"
Freshman,4,"As an incoming class of 2024 freshmen, I've only taken online summer courses, but the teachers have been very passionate about their work and the student body has been incredibly welcoming!  Their covid response could be a little more straightforward though...lots of students are still generally confused about the housing situation, and when course selection will be open...but beyond that the environment is amiable and intelligent!"
Freshman,4,"As an incoming class of 2024 freshmen, I've only taken online summer courses, but the teachers have been very passionate about their work and the student body has been incredibly welcoming!"
Alum,4,"Moving classes online after the start of COVID-19 was difficult, but my professors were really helpful with the transition."
Freshman,4,"The community at Sarah Lawrence is so loving and welcoming; I found my people here. I love how I can explore and learn about such diverse topics with the conference system. It is difficult work and requires a lot of motivation, but you get a great education."
Freshman,4,"Great classes and professors. Opportunity to pursue individual interests in class. The community is very nice. I wish the campus were slightly bigger, the school were more affordable, and it had better dining options."
Senior,4,Sarah Lawrence is an amazingly unique school. The education you receive there is unlike anything else you could get anywhere else. The only place the college needs to improve is in its administration and fund allocation.
Sophomore,4,"The most important thing to me when considering Sarah Lawrence was the style of classes and learning. No gen eds, smaller class sizes, essay and writing based work. The people here can be stuck up sometimes but once you find your group its completely worth it all. I love the fact that the classes you can choose are so open and creative, there's most likely a class for anything you could imagine. Its definitely a place for creative thinkers."
Freshman,4,I like the school a lot. Its small nature allows students to connect with professors which can help when you have questions about a project or paper. This school school has a lot of creative courses as well as a lot of flexibility in terms of building your schedule and they really cater to your interests. It is a very writing heavy school so you should take that into account if that is a deterrent .
Sophomore,4,"This school has freedom within its curriculum: Students are able to choose courses which adhere to their passions. In my case, I was very adamant on finding a school that offered both Russian and Animation. I thought this was impossible until I found Sarah Lawrence College. SLC not only offers both subjects, but is flexible enough that you can study in both departments simultaneously if the courses' class times don't interfere. However, I can vouch that Animation does not match its Russian counterpart. Few faculty members teach it. Compare this to an art school or a university with an animation department: there, a multitude of faculty teach the subject. Multiple faculty allows multiple conduits from which you can learn the art form. Thus, you develop a unique artistic voice. This is crucial to any kind of art study. Additionally, there are only entry level courses: Beginners enter into the same classes with the more advanced. Thus, advanced students re-learn previously taught topics."
Junior,4,"Sarah Lawrence's professors are some of the best in the country. If you are driven and passionate about your interests, and you take advantage of the small classes and the 1-on-1 time with professors, you will find yourself incredibly rewarded. However, students some times fall through the cracks because there is such great academic freedom and the professors do not make much of an effort to challenge students who struggle."
Sophomore,4,"SLC has unique and specific courses over a variety of academic categories. Being able to delve right into what you want without gen eds is satisfying, and conference projects can be rewarding to finish (even if you procrastinated). Profs are generally great, bar complaints about some weekly workloads. If you combine your lectures + seminars right you won't get overburdened. Campus is gorgeous but inaccessible to those who can't/have difficulty when they walk up steep hills around campus. Everyone can find a reason to complain about dorms but first years can easily live in apartments with full kitchens and bathrooms which is cool. Campus food is alright unless you're a picky eater, then you'll probably be hitting up the salad bar or the pasta OTD every day. Only eat the pizza on weekends when it's regular. There are many clubs + it's easy to start your own. We joke about sports but it's not alienating to actually join a team. If you know where to look for parties, you'll find them."
Junior,4,"Compared to my high school Sarah Lawrence is a paradise. There are still issues on campus but they are dealt with in a much better fashion than i have ever seen. There are amazing people here who actually care about the wellbeing of others. The professors are amazing, and the quality of education and learning is sublime."
Freshman,4,"I honestly don’t know why the party scene score is so low. For the size of our school, the parties can be good. Everyone does coke and is an alcoholic but it’s fun!"
Sophomore,4,"I have loved my academic experience at SLC so much! The student to professor ratio is unparalleled. The course is laborious, but when you are studying something of interest, the work isn't as bad. The professors actually care about you and your academic success, which is really nice when you're having a hard time with the material. I've already learned a lot in my field, and I feel like this experience is unlike any other university. The dorms are okay--depending on the building. Hill House is okay, but can feel isolated due to the location. Taylor is a typical dorm. There are other options, but the with housing lottery can be tough to get where you prefer to live. There are several places within walking distance to eat and shop. The train station is within walking distance, and it's only a 30 minute ride to NYC."
Junior,4,"Academics are fantastic, the teachers care about you and believe in your research and goals. There is a strong support system from the staff. The classes range but it is a type of learning style with no tests and a focus on essays and research. The social aspect is lacking to say the least. People are very isolated."
Junior,4,"There are a lot of things about Sarah Lawrence that I love. The small class sizes, the dedicated professors, the passionate student body, and the conference work fit my academic and intellectual needs perfectly. That being said, the 15 credits cap can be limiting, there are members of the administration that are often indifferent and occasionally incompetent, and the infrequency with which most classes meet is frustrating given the high tuition and alienating given the limited options for alternative forms of socialization (there is no greek life and no student center)."
Junior,4,The education is more than worth it if you can overlook the mediocre social experience. I would recommend the school to anyone legitimately serious about their education.
Freshman,4,"It's basically tumblr in real life, which can be both good and bad. It's a pretty weird place, but it's lovable. It's certainly got it's flaws like everywhere else does, but overall, i'm really happy with my decision to come here."
Freshman,4,"I love the unique education system. They have a special liberal arts system that is completely their own. I feel free and conifident to pursue my own interests and I have plenty of resources to support me, as well. "
College Sophomore,4,"Its a bit difficult to navigate at times, but it is still a great deal. ESP the all gender housing."
College Sophomore,4,I think the college does great with dealing with sexual assault issues. The school is very progressive which means students feel very strongly about these sorts of things and always want to help anybody that has dealt with it.
College Sophomore,4,The housing is very unique. The dorms aren't always traditional which is nice however they seem to be a little outdated but that is just part of the originality of the college.
College Sophomore,4,Sarah Lawrence is a very open-minded and progressive school. It's academics is like no other school in the country. It gives students the freedom to truly venture into their academics and take any class they desire. Students control their education and dive into their passion without any limitations.
College Freshman,4,"Professors are (generally) friendly and easy to talk to, are expert in their field, and are good at their job (namely, teaching)."
College Freshman,4,The powers that be are very concerned for the safety of the students and the general legal health of the campus.
College Freshman,4,The teams are all of quality and the intramural sports are supported by the student body.
College Freshman,4,"While I haven't been here long, I already feel a sense of community. Everyone's willing to help out and they're all really dedicated to their studies."
College Sophomore,4,"Your education at SLC is what you make it. Professors are great, they want to help and you learn a lot if you work hard and are invested in your education."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a good number of international students- most of them from Asia, china and india in particular. Aside from that, most students are white, and the administration is making an effort to acknowledge and fix its own issues concerning race. The Black Lives Matter movement gained traction on campus because there is such a noticeable racial demographic on campus. We also have a large population of jewish students."
College Sophomore,4,"We all feel pretty safe. Occasionally there are high school students who harass students along kimball. There have been a few incidents of students being egged but it's taken very seriously. We have a sexual assault task force and good, open dialogue around assault on campus. Everyone takes a mandatory seminar on it within the first week and promises they'd never hurt anyone but at least 30 assaults happened on campus this year and most of them were student-student incidents."
College Sophomore,4,"Not many students are involved in sports. I was on crew team and we couldn't even get a coach till 3/4 of the way through the year, however the department was very supportive of us running the selection process and we got a great coach that we all love. The team is very close and has a lot of team spirit. Joining a team is a great way to meet people and make friends as a first year. The school doesn't have a lot of team spirit and often likes to blame the athletics department for funding issues which is a good example of the scapegoating and self centeredness and misinformation that easily takes hold around campus. Some of my teammates say they even got negative comments on campus when they wore gear that marked them as part of a team."
College Freshman,4,"Your physical wellbeing is pretty much solid at SLC. Campus security is great - friendly and really there for the students, not to get them in trouble. There's no real issue with campus crime. Sexual assault is present as on any college campus in this day and age, but it's taken very seriously both by students and administrators. The support for victims is very strong, and perpetrators are treated harshly - in every reported case I know of in recent years, the perpetrator was expelled. Emotionally speaking, it's a very safe campus if you have social anxiety and want to be left alone. Not so much if you want a friendly atmosphere, but you win some and lose some."
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe on the SLC campus. Sometimes walking along the main road Kimball Avenue can be a bit nerve wracking, as local high school kids sometimes drive by and catcall or throw things at students, but this is rare, and security takes it very seriously. Campus crime isn't a big problem as far as I know. 

Security is generally pretty good about keeping a close eye on students and keeping campus safe. They are all pretty friendly as well, which makes it easier to approach them or ask for help."
College Junior,4,"The alumni network seems to be very strong, as are job and internships prospects. I haven't had an experience with employers on campus, but my impressions of career services is good."
College Junior,4,"Sarah Lawrence is unique, passionate and progressive."
College Junior,4,"My program is extremely insular - so I can't say much about the experiences of other grad students.  I have enjoyed almost all classes and professors so far.  Sometimes I feel as though the administration forgets that we are adults in grad school, juggling jobs and families, rather than full-time undergrads.  Otherwise, the experience is really what you make of it."
College Junior,4,"Not too many program options in my field, but SLC was a source of many of its founders."
College Junior,4,"Bronxville is a fairly safe area, and I usually see SLC vans driving around."
College Junior,4,Surrounded by professors who are leaders in their field and extremely interesting classmates!
College Freshman,4,"There are blue lights everywhere, campus security is strong, and there is always a building you can run to nearby if you are threatened. I feel completely safe here and I am so thankful SLC took the initiative to make this campus safe and comfortable."
College Freshman,4,"The value of a Sarah Lawrence degree varies, but is usually valuable. This is an excellent place of learning, and many employers know of this. A Sarah Lawrence degree would be particularly helpful in writing and theatre careers, especially since there is such a large alumni network in these areas."
College Freshman,4,"I am very happy with my campus housing. The only problem is that it is very far away from main campus, which is an issue in the snow. The dorms are lovely, especially the apartment-style ones."
College Freshman,4,"I am not very involved in sports, but I can honestly say that the students I have talked to who participate in sports at Sarah Lawrence are very happy. They simply are not as popular of an activity to participate in or attend; the arts are more popular here."
College Freshman,4,"I am unsure whether or not I would choose my school again. I tend to second-guess my decision and wonder if I should have pursued musical theatre, my passion, more in-depth at a conservatory. However, I enjoy my experience at Sarah Lawrence College so far, and I would like to see how these next few semesters go before I make that decision."
College Freshman,4,"Depending on the profesesor, courses can be very thorough, and engaging. There is a large variety of courses you can take, and each professor's style of teaching is different. The number of students per class rarely seems to be over fifteen, unless you're taking a lecture."
College Junior,4,The Experience has been great!
College Junior,4,"Student athletes and coaches are excellent, but a majority of the student population does not seem to accept athletes.  We are frequently bashed as being dumb or viewed as stereotypical hollywood jocks, which is clearly not the case.  The Soccer Team for instance is filled with students interested in neuroscience, biblical and world literature, politics, economics, gender equality, filmmaking, philosophy, etc. There is little to no fan support or school spirit in athletics, which is a real bummer when athletics can be such a great thing in bringing people together and keeping healthy."
College Junior,4,"Much of the off campus housing seems to be more worth while than on-campus housing, cost wise.  Personally, I actually was not able to get a place off-campus because of my financial aid package, but I have multiple friends who have pretty great apartments close off campus, paying less or around what I'm paying for much better living conditions. Of course, the walk to campus is an inconvenience, and students living off campus may be a bit disconnected from on-campus events and parties, but it seems off-campus housing may be worth it in terms of living conditions and cost."
College Junior,4,"Sarah Lawrence truly does seem to try and help students out with financial aid, although the process can take a little while.  I did receive the financial aid I needed last semester, but as I've experienced it this summer, communication can at times be poor, but the people who work in the financial aid department are wonderful and make up for any frustration."
College Freshman,4,The professors are amazing. They really want to talk to you and make sure you get what you need out of your classes.
College Freshman,4,"The school really tries it's best to get everyone the financial aid they need. I wish I had gotten more, but you really just need to talk to financial aid and they will try to work it out."
College Freshman,4,"The food is really great in a lot of off-campus dining venues, but it is often also very expensive."
Freshman,2,"The location of the college is perfect, Bronxville is cute and just a 20 minute walk and the Cross County Mall is 20 min away walk, as well. And it's just a 40 minute train ride to the city. Unfortunately, there are many drawbacks. For one, the entire campus needs to be updated, everything is falling apart. The food is the same all the time and the quality is poor. It is likely you will get bumped from a class, then you will have little to no options that you'll like and that'll fit with your schedule. I found it very difficult to get a good job on campus--and I'm on work-study!! Doesn't feel like there are a lot of resources on campus if you feel dissatisfied with life there. There are zero activities or involvement events for freshmen to make the transition easier that are actually fun and worth going to."
Freshman,2,"My first year at Sarah Lawrence was a very rough experience. While the professors are good (at least from what I’ve heard; I only had one professor that I really loved, and they were a temporary staff member), you can only have 3 classes at a time, unless you pay extra for a fourth course, which feels like a major restriction to education. The main problem, however, was the campus culture. Drug use is rampant, which isn’t unexpected for a college, but the problem is that it isn’t just weed and alcohol; there’s coke, methalyne, LSD... And the people themselves can be very fake. If you’re really into theatre/music/art, then maybe that will make it worth it for you."
College Sophomore,2,The parties on campus are small and the big ones get busted quickly.
College Sophomore,2,"Okay so I had a bad first year. My classes were the best part of my experience which is why I'm moving off campus but remaining a student. I had a lot of trouble with people attacking me for not blindly agreeing with everything they said. I came to SLC as a gender studies student but after constantly being told I shouldn't talk in most situations-even in class- because I'm cishet, I'm done with that. I'm not a typical SLC student but I've still managed to learn a good bit. If you're a self victimizing rich queer kid who loves theatre and plans to study writing, this is the perfect fit. If you are logical and not blindly radically left and are not on the LGBTQIA spectrum and aren't the most comfortable with nudity, this may not be the best fit. However, if you come to SLC to work hard and learn and question, you can learn a lot. Forget the on campus politics and be yourself. You may have a hard time but you'll learn a lot."
College Sophomore,2,"It's pretty bad. I had some bad roommate experiences. After I switched dorms, the hall I lived in had a weekly exterminator come to keep the roaches at bay. The New Dorms (circa the 1960's) are classic cinder block boxes and fire alarms are known to misbehave. The heat is either not on or on- non adjustable. The kitchens are fine but usually there is one per hall and they aren't kept clean by students. The bathrooms aren't built well- they're built cheap. The wall in our shower fell out because it was poorly constructed. Hill House is suite style living and has a kitchen but is hotter than hell in the summer. Hill House is also known as Hell House. Sometimes the elevators break and it is on the other end of campus from everything else."
College Junior,2,"Security cares about the wrong things. They care about penalizing pot smokers and kids who forget their keys, but will defend our disgustingly corrupt administration and student groups to their death."
College Junior,2,"I rowed for SLC's crew team this year, D3, and the school refused to find us a coach for about 3/4 of the year. The athletics here are a joke."
College Freshman,2,"If you're into small groups getting together and getting drunk/high in dorm rooms, you're set. Around the beginning of the year there will be parties on the lawn, but even those are basically just being drunk and shmoozing for an hour or two until security busts it up. Sometimes there'll be parties in slo or mead way houses, and there are some great bashes, but they're few and far between."
College Freshman,2,"Nobody cares tbh. The crew team didn't have a coach for all of last semester. But some people do them and have a good time, they're just not taken seriously."
College Freshman,2,"Some dorms are lovely, some are crap. Hill is a nightmare. New dorms feel like an institution. Old dorms are marginally better. Smaller dorms (Tweed, Lynd) are beautiful and have absolutely lovely rooms. Group housing is available (Andrews, Slo), and way nicer than most dorms. I've lucked out and have loved every room I've lived in, but most people I know feel differently.

The social atmosphere is a train wreck. It's a deeply toxic place, and while some people manage to find a good group within that and overcome the SLC fog, I couldn't. Negativity is rampant, and ""Sarah-Lawrencing"" has become a term used to describe the act of seeing someone who you know and intentionally ignoring them when you pass them on campus. There are some great people, but overall it's a negative, unfriendly environment. And there's absolutely no sense of campus community, except at the formals when everyone loves each other for one night (with the help of copious alcohol+)."
College Freshman,2,Students have little to no interest in the athletic department.
College Freshman,2,"The athletics facilities are great, but no one really cares about sports on campus. The school is trying to make a big deal out of it and recruit students since we just got into Division 3, but the majority of students are more focused on academics than athletics."
College Junior,2,"Sarah Lawrence is trying to boost their athletic program, which they are doing slowly but surely. But the best teams on campus are really the swim team and softball. Sarah Lawrence just became division 3"
College Junior,2,"Sarah Lawrence has a quiet nightlife. The parties never get much bigger than what you get during freshers week, and with noise restrictions from the campus cops, many parties that reach 20+ people are usually shut down pretty quick. No, if you want nightlife, be prepared to take the trip into New York. You will learn quickly that unless you have a few jobs during your time at campus, this is not an economically viable way to live. So, moral of the story. get a job to have money to pay for New York. Its about 16 bucks round trip from Bronxville to Grand Central, and from Grand Central to most of the night life in the city, well, expect at least a few stops on the subway, taxi's if you want to reach the best night life. Or walk if you just want to go take another selife in Times Square. You will get bored of Times Square. Except when you have friends and family over, then you can say its cool all over again."
College Junior,2,"You don't go to Sarah Lawrence for sports. 

You go for studies. There are good facilities, nice basketball court, great swimming pool, squash courts, and a decent gym. I  guarantee you, if your not already a big sports head, you will likely only use the gym. 

And maybe the squash courts once or twice."
College Junior,2,"Bronxville is a quiet town and while there are not many options. They are good. They just get old really fast. 

As for late night food, ordering out works until 11, its usual standard fare. If you want a good meal, its better to head into New York for a special meal, or better yet, stay home and make one yourself with friends and have a dinner party."
College Junior,2,"Sarah Lawrence's food is certainly not one of its strengths. The hours are standard for the cafeteria (which has little to no food variety throughout the year). The food is bland and leaves much to be desired. Its college, so its not going to be great. But I found a much better investment of my time was learning to cook out of my dorm room then make the trek across campus to the cafeteria and pub (which is not much better in terms of food but has later hours.)."
College Senior,2,We are not a sporty place. We just aren't. If you want to play sports you can -- literally you can sign up for varsity teams most semesters -- but don't expect anyone to show up to your games.
College Junior,2,"There was a reputation in the 90's and prior of SLC being a liberal, hands-off institution when it came to policing students. This has changed entirely since the early 2000's."
College Sophomore,2,No one really cares about sports at Sarah Lawrence. I've never seen more than 3 people at a game at one time.
College Freshman,2,"It definitely depends on your friend group. Low-key, it may or not be very easy to buy alcohol around here. You didn't hear it from me."
College Junior,2,The off campus housing is not affordable for students and if it is affordable it is not in the best parts of an area or it is not close to campus.
College Freshman,2,"Not many bars, most people just have fun on campus"
College Junior,2,Updates are needed but continuously ignored. Dorms see the worst of this but the gym is pretty awful as well.
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus is only available next to hill house, the dorm that is furthest from main campus. If you live on main campus and have a car, you're not able to park your car anywhere closer than hill house, which is a 10-15 minute walk away or a 5 minute shuttle ride away; although shuttles are available in odd increments as they run on a loop, making it depend on students' ride needs exactly."
College Junior,2,This is New York. It rains. It snows. The sun shines. Any weather phenomena is possible. We've been hit by blizzards and hurricanes. We've had tornado warnings. We have a week of 80 degree weather followed by a week of 50 degree weather. Make sure you have a weather app on your phone and make sure to check it before you dress yourself and go outside. 
College Junior,2,"It's hard to throw a party that doesn't get busted and some of the security guards are total assholes. Sometimes students will call in noise complaints on other students (don't be that guy) but sometimes the guards just patrol the campus and break up parties when they see them. In terms of punishment, I don't know anyone who has had to pay a fine, but I know it's possible to get fined if you have multiple offenses."
College Junior,2,"There isn't a focus on athletics; I don't know much about teams here. We don't have a lot of fans/games/fun around athletics, and unfortunately, I don't know of many athletic clubs/activities. If sports are your #1 priority, I can't imagine the school is for you. But if you think the school is a good fit in other ways, and love sports, look further, there might be a team or a way to start one. Also look at what grades actual athletes give."
Recent Alumnus,2,"On the Way – SLC sports get a bad rap because we're a small school and we can't support a broad range of teams.  However, a number of our varsity teams cleaned up in our regional conference this season, and we've added several new men's teams in recent years.  Our homecoming game is a big deal every fall."
College Freshman,2,"There is a PE requirement, but you can fulfill that with Zumba or yoga classes (~1.5 hours/week for 6 weeks). We have a basketball team and a soccer team, and there are some people who go to those games, but it definitely isn't widespread. We don't have football, and the fans are kind of apathetic (particularly upperclassmen, who rarely attend games). The gym is tiny, so it's packed if you don't go early in the morning or right before it closes."
College Senior,2,There is 1 parking lot for everyone but staff who have their own. It's $200 for a year which is decent. Enforcement is hit or miss.
College Sophomore,2,"Lots of beautiful, intelligent girls, and lots of mediocre guys for them to date."
College Sophomore,2,"It is the Northeast so the weather is pretty extreme and is very unpredictable. In the summer months, and even into October, it is humid and hot. A fan is must since almost all buildings do not have air conditioning. It does rain quite a bit so I would bring rain boots and an umbrella unless you want to get soaked. The winter can be brutal. The campus is pretty good with clearing the snow away but classes have been canceled because of snow. I would also have a pair of snow boots."
College Sophomore,2,"There is one dining hall on campus, Bates. And the food is pretty lousy. There is a salad bar all the time, which is nice. Sometimes there are vegan options. The school has a contract with AVI and I, along with many others, detest AVI. I know they treat their workers pretty poorly and these folks don't deserve it. They buy Sysco products and I hate Sysco. You'll definitely miss home-cooked food for sure. Something that I find irritating is that you MUST have a mea plan. The school requires you to have a meal plan even if you don't want one because SLC has a contract with AVI, saying that every student must have a meal plan. In this regard, I find SLC greedy."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Too Much – Sarah Lawrence is a tiny school surrounded by rural and semi commercial areas. There is a mall within 15 minutes walking, which provides standard mall-fare. In Bronxville itself, there are higher-end, albiet mediocre, restaurants and a couple delis. Students seldom eat out, opting instead to save money for meals they would otherwise during a treat to NYC."
College Sophomore,2,"Little Need for Off-Campus – Because Sarah Lawrence is buttressed between the WASP-y town of Bronxville, NY and Yonkers, NY (the of which Bronxville residents have been known to describe as being ""everyday life""), there are few students who choose to live off campus. The college does a good enough job of providing their own housing."
College Junior,2,"Make sure you get it secured for all four years. I have friends who, after their freshman year, got 10k pulled off, for almost no change in status."
College Sophomore,2,"More Girls Than Guys – Mostly girls, but not really interested in meeting straight males, we may have 3/4th girls, but 1/3 of those girls are in a relationship, and the other two are dating each other."
College Sophomore,2,"The college touts a large average financial aid package, and there's a noticeable minority of students who have had their tuition seriously reduced thanks to aid.  But not a single dollar of my need was met, and I know plenty of other students that either got no help or were greatly underserved by financial aid.  At the most expensive college in the country, that is a huge barrier to entry for many qualified applicants."
College Sophomore,2,"Needs More/Better Shuttles – Shuttle coverage is shoddy because the student drivers are lazy or don't show up for work.  Even when it's security guards driving, the coverage doesn't improve much.  Also the only regular shuttles off campus are a nightly shuttle to the train station (never during the day, even on move-in or move-out days) and a once-a-week shuttle to NYC."
Senior,1,I was studying abroad this past year and have not had the opportunity to experience online classes at SLC yet.
Junior,1,"If your interested in having the worst time of your life, go here! Students take 3 classes a semester. The school only wants money. Waste of your education. Horrible dorms, super small."
Freshman,1,"This is a school for Tumblr kids. Its full of rich kids who whine and complain. It's full of liberals who whine and complain but do nothing to change the world. It's so liberal that if you say anything that disagrees with the extreme liberal opinion you're gonna be attacked. Everyone says they hate the school, not because there's any reason for it, they just say that. Everyone's competing over who's the most depressed. The entire vibe of the school is negative. The classes are good if you get a class where people talk otherwise it's a waste of time. I've been told you can get interesting classes, but all the classes I got had no academic rigor, and were way easier than the classes I had in High School, and I was taking a class with all upperclassmen. The school is so small everyone's bitching and gossiping about everybody. If these are your type of people, than this school will be great for you, if not it's a painful experience."
Sophomore,1,"The best thing about the place is the Donning program. But only if your don is amazing like mine. Otherwise, everyone has their head up their ass with no grasp on the real world. If you disagree with the liberals on campus, you're ostracized. SLC kids only accept the right kind of weird. The sense of humor on campus is juvenile and weird. Only a certain kind of person can go here. I think the place will be shut down in the next 10 years- it's going bankrupt."
College Junior,1,"In terms of political views, basically no diversity. Hillary supporters this past year received threats for advertising ""I'm With Her"" posters. Imagine every obnoxious liberal hipster you hate in one place."
College Junior,1,Security cares about pot smokers sometimes but often times people just sit out and smoke weed with no punishment.
College Junior,1,"Sarah Lawrence has provided me with little to no skills for entering the world post-graduate. I had two memorable professors, took basically the same classes every semester with a population of students who I generally disliked as a whole. I am a liberal-minded, open individual, but SLC students live in a bubble of oversensitivity."
College Junior,1,I regret to say that most individuals I know who have graduated are now waiters with an English and Queer Studies degree that is getting them nowhere. SLC fits that stereotype to a T.
College Junior,1,"Now that I have transferred, I can absolutely say that SLC has the worst housing you can imagine. They don't have enough buildings for the amount of students they have, they will never accommodate your needs and the lottery is impossible. Off campus housing is basically non-existent because of the neighborhoods surrounding SLC."
College Junior,1,"I regret attending Sarah Lawrence. I have now transferred, and I am so glad I did. Do not be swept up by its ""magical Hogwarts"" looks. The dorms are deteriorating, there literally isn't one nice, normal college dorm on the entire campus. I got food poisoning six times per semester, minimum. And I am not alone. This was everyone. You are living inside a rotting, close-minded, privileged bubble for 9 months of the year. Yes, the liberal arts were a bad fit for me, but I've visited other liberal arts schools and there are better options. SLC is desperate for students. Desperate. Do not delve into this wormhole where no one can get out, save yourself the misery. Choose Vassar."
College Junior,1,"There is no greek life. If you thought you were going to find it here, you will be laughed at. 

Sarah Lawrence laughs at Greek life."
College Senior,1,"There are no keggers or frat parties. This is a small gathering, cliquey type school. You can rage if you know the right people, but there are also large swaths of the school LARPing on the lawn, so take that as you will..."
College Junior,1,"I've heard SLC is respectable with financial aid and I don't mean to damage their reputation, but I myself and several of my acquaintances here have struggled financially to pay for Sarah Lawrence and have received little to no help from the financial aid office. Despite repeated pleas for access to more money or at least more information about scholarships and/or loans, financial aid has done little to help me other than to send me links to things I've already checked out and often haven't fully understood. I've had a poor time dealing with financial aid here and unless you're in dire need, it's tough to go here if you're from the middle class. You can certainly make it work, but expect to be in moderate debt once you graduate. "
College Sophomore,1,Not much diversity. Only a small group of people of color. People tend to dress alike once they come here.
College Sophomore,1,"I almost gave a F because it's really very bad. First, the housing process is absolutely ridiculous. At SLC, we have a housing littering. Every student randomly gets a number, from 1 to however many students you have in your grade. It goes from seniors down to sophomores. Freshmen are assigned dorms. The student wants to get a small number, because that means he will be able to pick first. And then there's always the guaranteed wait list....which isn't always guaranteed. I know of a couple people who did not  get housing. I could go on and on about this stupid system. 
Housing in general is awful. The college is not accommodating to students who want substance-free/ quiet housing.  The buildings are not the most aesthetically pleasing. The insides of all campus housing is an ugly white color ( which does rub off), and they uses this gloopy paint. It's awful. Really really awful. 
The Resident Advisors are also not the most supportive. Sometimes I think they're downright stupid. If you're a student who needs to get up earlier in the morning and go to bed at night, the RA's will decide not to do anything about noise. The college curfew for quiet is from 12-8 on weekdays and 2am-11am on weekends. 
My RA also doesn't really do her job well, especially concerning cleanliness and common sense rules. 
It's also very expensive, but SLC in general is very expensive. It's usually more expensive to live off-campus though."
College Junior,1,"NYC has great food options, but if you live near campus they take about an hour and a half to get to, unless you want to pay almost $10 one way to take the train. Options in Bronxville area are pretty bleak."
College Junior,1,"Health Services is Terrible – It's terrible. They will refer you to your normal doctor for anything more serious than a cough. After a physical there I received over $400 of bills in lab fees for what they did. The psychological staff is minimally better - therapy is ok, but many find it unhelpful. 

I would like to have the name of ""Health Services"" officially changed to ""Condom Repository""."
College Freshman,1,"It is so hard to find other ethnic students around campus. At the most, I may see about three Asian students in one day, and this is if I'm lucky."
College Senior,1,"Smoke of All Sorts – Perhaps it's because we're all artists, but sometimes it seems like everyone smokes. Every where you go, cigarettes are there. It's been shrinking somewhat over the last few years, but not significantly so. There are also certain parts of campus that you can't walk through without smelling pot smoke, so much so that tour groups have to make jokes about it when they're walking through Slonim Woods."
College Freshman,1,"Not So Much. If you really need to get off campus there's always Bronxville, although it tends to be pretty expensive and normally nicer places, not meant for a family/college setting. Then there's Yonkers, but you can't really get there unless you know somebody with a car. Or you feel like walking in sketchy areas at night."

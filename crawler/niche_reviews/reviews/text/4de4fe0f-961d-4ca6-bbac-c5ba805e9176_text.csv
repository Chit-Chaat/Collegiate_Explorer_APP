Freshman,5,It’s a combination of expanding one’s academic horizons while experiencing life outside of your parents’ control for the first time.
Graduate Student,5,"I see a lot of reviews in the internet about Hult. Mostly it's good to see the reviews about any university which helps future students to take decision which university is the best fit for their Career, ability to afford, future opportunities, campus and college life, academics and so many others which really shapes a student completing graduation from that university.
I attended Hult International Business School, in September 2017 intake. I did my first masters degree in International Business after completing my undergrad from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai. My experience in the first year was academically fantastic since I studied same curriculum in advanced and real world level, but I enjoyed diverse culture of Hult having multiple nationality and got to explore entire world by sitting in same campus. Amazing modern infrastructure and campus facilities are awesome. 
Overall, I would like to Thank Hult IBS."

Freshman,5,"Hult Boston is a small business school that provides excellent professors and all the resources needed to get an outstanding education. The student body is very diverse, there are over 100 nationalities on the campus. However, if you don't do anything and don't study you will learn nothing, and the investment will be worthless."

My experience with hult was good enough. They keep in contact with you and help you with overall process.

It was a great experience and the professor supported us, while we were driven to tackle the challenge.

Sophomore,4,"Hult International Business Schools is really good institution. The San Francisco campus is actually pretty small which makes it easier to get to know everyone and also have some 1-on-1 time with the generous professors. The staff is always there to assist students and the professors unlike at other universities actually care for you and do their best for everyone to pass. 
Hult provides its students with exquisite resources! If you want to study business this is definitely the place for you. Every week there would be an entrepreneur coming to visit and present their journey which really enlightens, open the student's eyes and also motivates us as well. The professors provide students with assignments that reflect on everyday life and even give you projects that simulate what running an actual business in the real world in the actual Time would look like.
Hult is exiting, collective, and full of students from all over the world. You may even meet your future business partner here."
Graduate Student,4,"After a year of research on one year MBA programs, Hult is the only program that actually promotes its values through it's practical, collaborative, flexible  curriculum.

As a 68 year graduate student, I have managed projects with $600 million budgets, staffs in the thousands and moved Pope Francis through the streets of Philadelphia.  Hult accepted me into is Global MB program promoted my intergenerational experience as positive aspect of the program year"
Senior,4,Hult is an international university where I've got to learn not only about myself but also about how different cultures are. This has given me a broader insight and knowledge on how businesses differ in other countries. I believe it's a great place to come and study. This is due to the people that work here and also how many opportunities it has given me to make my career better.
College Senior,4,The curriculum is leaned towards a practical experience rather than only theory. The class tasks and the environment in the school really pushes you to work together in order to reach more efficiency.
College Senior,4,The diversity at Hult is unmatchable. The fact that you can work and study along people from all around the world is very unique. In the business world of today it is not only a great opportunity but it is essential.
College Senior,4,The class size is really what matter to me. The fact that each class allows a max. of 60 people is great because there always is this feeling that we are engaged and every student counts.
College Senior,4,"The curriculum is aiming towards team projects so you get to learn how to work as part of a group. This is essential for business nowadays and additionally, being able to work with people from all over the world is a great plus."
College Senior,4,Hult is a unique business school. It is an experience that has enriched me in many ways. As an international student you get to not only meet other peers from around the world but maybe also your future colleagues. The network happens within the school and it is a great opportunity.

Recent Alumnus,4,"The variety of classes offered is great and most of the professors are caring, knowledgeable and passionate."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Classes at Hult are mostly very practical and hands-on which for me makes them very interesting. Most of the professors are very passionate about what they teach and it is normal to get real-life cases or even clients that you work for in your classes and present to in the end. This makes me feel that we did not only learn the theory, but we also got to apply the learned things in real life."
Recent Alumnus,4,There was no difficulties in transferring my credits from my associates degree. Hult made sure that I could transfer as much credit as long as it fulfills the school's syllabi
Recent Alumnus,4,"Career Services at Hult is great! I love their ability to pull companies, get us in contact with their contacts."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The school is definitely a hub for knowledge and networking. Student body is encouraged to be proactive in starting and expanding their network by joining different networking events around San Francisco. Moreover, with the unique international aspect, recreating the environment elsewhere is almost impossible."
College Junior,4,"I did not have to transfer credits. However, in terms of flexibility, we get the schedule of start and end of terms in advance. Professors provide a syllabus with deadlines and grade weight. If I have to miss a class I let the professor know in advance and if more than one class I notify registry."

College Sophomore,4,The entrepreneurship major allows exploration of the use of business to alleviate social poverty. Strong industry networks and partnerships mean opportunities for practice of business acumen.
Graduate Student,2,"For European Students, this School is a waste of time if you expect to actually learn something new. There are students accepted to a Master Business Degree with any Bachelor background which Is why the master mainly consists of basic courses. The workload is a joke and the class environment feels more like high school than adult education. If you got a bad grade on an assignment, all you had to do is go to the prof and bargain for a better grade. It's more like shopping for education and they know that. The courses are not at all hands-on and business case related. Assignments and grades are based on quizzes, participation and individual tests, project-based team work usually makes up for only about 30% of the courses. The highly praised future challenge is the biggest scam I have ever seen in my entire life as its nothing more than writing reports and praising the professor and the class on what you liked about it."
Freshman,2,"I have since withdrawn from Hult but I made the biggest mistake of my life coming here. The entire school is a scam. Each campus is a tiny school about the size of a high school. My freshman class only had 60 students. They were all essentially kids of millionaires and were very self absorbed. Cheating was rampant, students had no drive to study, and Hult provided no place whatsoever for students to study in. I wouldn’t even call this a school. It feels like a cult."
Recent Alumnus,2,"As Hult is a relatively new school most recruiters have not yet heard about the school (although this is slowly getting better). However this made it extremely hard to find a job/ internship and in my case (and many others) jobs or internships that were found were not due to connections made during career fairs, etc but self-sponsored. Hult has lately started to have career fairs on campus, but if you're looking for big multinationals you will be disappointed (if you're looking for a smaller company or start-up the school might be able to help you better). Campus recruiting is unfortunately non-existent. There has also been a series of speaker-events last year, and even though this time there were multinationals such as pwc it did not seem as if they were particularly interested in recruiting from Hult. 

Generally speaking, it can be seen that Hult has put a lot of effort into improving its careers team and career opportunities for its students in the past year. However this process takes time and for many students who are graduating now this improvement has not been early and fast enough."
College Senior,2,It doesn't have the facilities that I thought that it would have.
Niche User,1,"This school felt like a scam from the moment I arrived. I HATED IT. They lost all my documents, they didn’t even have a proper financial aid office or bursar office, and the school essentially caters to rich overseas students who want to study in the US but don’t have any intelligence whatsoever. Total scam, avoid."
Niche User,1,Hult doesn’t offer any degrees online at all. The school is solely focused on their on campus learning.

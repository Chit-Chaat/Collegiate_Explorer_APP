Alum,5,Centenary is the best decision of my life.  I got a great education that prepared me for success in life.  Early leadership experiences at Centenary set me up for success.  I was very involved and had as much help and advice from my professors as I wanted.  My success was very important to my professors.  The campus is beautiful and it was the perfect play for me to transition to “real life.”
Alum,5,I have no idea why I am required to fill in this part of the survey.  I didn’t attend any online classes at Centenary.  This review site is odd.
Alum,5,"Centenary is a college where you can get involved from the first day you step upon campus.  There are many opportunities for engagement with various student organizations, and its campus culture emphasizes training to become a leader in your respective field.  It’s a community that stresses supportive collaboration rather than aggressive competition.  Your professors encourage you to be the best that you can be, and they work closely with you to help you excel."
Sophomore,5,I love both the academic and community environment that Centenary offers. I have amazing relationships with my teachers and my classmates that provide a more enriching experience.
Freshman,5,A true gem in North Louisiana. My college is a small liberal arts college located in Shreveport. The college is small therefore there is  a close relationship between students and with professors. Besides that academics there a many activities and sports that students can take part in. Nobody goes unnoticed at Centenary. I have had a wonderful freshman year!
Niche User,5,they are so friendly. the last few months in process of applying they have been so kind and helpful. My admissions councilor has helped guide me through the process with any questions.
Junior,5,"I adore Centenary. There are incredible opportunities for research, graduate/professional-level projects, and internships available for any student, including freshmen. The professors encourage students to create their own values by facilitating international opportunities (Centenary is the #1 undergrad college for international travel currently!) and inspiring connections between the students and the community. Every student participates in some form of community service, all freshman spend their first ten days of school in Paris, our pre-professional tracks have 80-100% acceptance rates, and nearly everything on campus is 100% student-led. Centenary is the place for people who want to do more."
Senior,5,Centenary is a very diverse and culturally dynamic place. It campus offers man activities to do while being a student here. Sports are a big thing here with the school being dominated by student athletes.
Alum,5,I absolutely loved my time here at Centenary College! I highly recommend any prospective student who is going through the college search to add Centenary to your list. Visit campus and you won't want to leave!
Sophomore,5,"Centenary College is a good balance of academics and student life while keeping you focused on the task at hand, GOOD GRADES."
College Freshman,5,I have learned more from this school than anywhere else. It's teaching me about my field and also how to be an adult. Very challenging but able to do. Nothing feels better than getting a great grade from hours of studying.
College Freshman,5,Foreign students and students of all kind attend here. No one judges it's very laid back and accepting.
College Freshman,5,They are Challenging and the professors push you to be the best you can be. Questions are always open and no answer is wrong. No one cheats due to the honor code which I find very good. It helps students be independent.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is going to grad school at Ivy League schools and if not, have the option to. Also everyone has acces to internships due to small community."
College Freshman,5,Some dorms may be smaller than the other but housing works with everyone for the best fit and the most comfortable stay. I truly enjoy my location and don't have to walk far for any classes or food.
College Freshman,5,I'm a current athlete and have access to all everything I need during season
College Freshman,5,"The Greek life is amazing, it makes you feel like you are in a home away from home. You get to know friends that end up being your best friends in college."
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very welcoming and very nice during pre-orientation events. Administrators were very understanding about my financial situation.
College Junior,5,Professors are flexible and understanding. Some of my best friends are professors.
College Sophomore,5,Overall Centenary is pretty famous for their academic program
College Sophomore,5,Security is constantly roaming around campus and I have never felt unsafe. If I just want campus security to walk me to my car all I have to do is call them and they will!
College Sophomore,5,The professors are very interested and involved with their students and strive to help them succeed. I have been very satisfied with my education so far.
College Junior,5,I love the program I'm in.  If I could do it all over again I would it took me three times to find the perfect major and I truly think I have.  I want to teach theatre and the only concern I have is trying to find a job as a theatre teacher.
College Junior,5,I went to Chicago for my internship.  The pay was about 120 a week working everyday which is good for a summer stock theatre.  I had to work back stage and acted which was something really new to me because being away from my family for so long was the most difficult challenge of all.
College Junior,5,I think really the hardest part about being a theatre major is the auditioning for plays.  I eventually overcame that fear and really that is the hardest part of being a theatre major.  The best tip I could give is to be yourself and not be scared because really everyone who has to audition is scared out of the pants already so your not alone.
College Junior,5,I love being a Theatre Major.  Its such a great major to be in.  Not only am I learning to act but I am learning things like welding and contruction and directing things that will get me jobs in the real world.  I think the tech calls a super unique only because it gives us a chance to see what working at a broadway stage looks and feels like.  The teachers here are also so experienced and know exactly what they are teaching about give us the feed back and the knowledge we need.
College Junior,5,Centenary is truly a great place to go to school.  I just love the teachers and the classes.  I feel I'm learning so much now that I'm here.  I am going to be proud to graduate from this school.
College Sophomore,5,"The Tavern – The Tavern, which is located across campus has great quality food at a good price! Their 100% beef hot dogs are to die for. The setting there is very nice, and they also offer study areas inside for students."
College Sophomore,5,Academic Programs Are Great – The academic programs here exceptional! The teachers are wonderful and will go above and beyond to help the students. There is plenty of one-on-one contact and many study groups and tutors available for sudents to get extra help.
College Junior,5,There are usually always available parking spots for both students and parent. Tickets won't be given out unless you blatantly ignore the rules listed on the back of the parking placard.
College Junior,5,"Just Awesome – The financial aid opportunities are great, the class sizes are small which make for a great learning experience, and the professors are very helpful. The CORE is designed to have the students take a wide variety of classes, while taking those necessary for their majors. The school provides students with lists of internships and job offers. The school also makes sure that each student gets and ""out of the country"" experience before they graduate. Centenary makes sure that the students are well-rounded and prepared for the real world."
College Junior,5,Yummy Options Offcampus – Dining off campus is very convenient and good with some authentic restaurants with good southern food.
College Junior,5,Great Accessablitliy – Most facilities are accessable at any time of the day and students are safely looked after by oncampus police.
College Sophomore,5,"Dry Campus – The campus is a dry campus, meaning there is no alcohol, or drugs, allowed on the campus property. The Department of Public Safety, or DPS, is pretty lenient the first offense, but do not expect to get away with it more than once. Peer pressure is not that common, mainly because everyone is very accepting of a person and the decisions that person makes."
College Junior,5,Centenary professors are some of the most personable in the country. They take entire classes to lunch and are very welcoming and ones to look up to.
College Sophomore,5,SO SMOOTH – I transferred in to Centenary from another private college and the process was so easy. I sent in a late application and they still accepted it.
College Sophomore,5,Beautiful Campus – Centenary is always making sure that the campus is safe and beautiful. Buildings are very new. In my  business classes the classrooms all have expensive leather chairs. The library is really nice except for the librarian. LOVE THE CAMPUS!!
College Freshman,5,"The facilities on campus are very nice. Our gymnasium is impeccable, hard to believe it is a college gym. We also have an indoor pool connected to our gymnasium which is awesome. The science building has been remodeled an looks great! Our Student Union Building (SUB) is an awesome place to relax or have a study group. Not to mention that the campus itself is beyond gorgeous."
College Freshman,5,"Grade a Sports – At Centenary College of Louisiana, varsity sports are a very big part of campus. Most of the students attending here are part of some athletic team. There are so many different sports available and intramural sports! We have great trainers and advisers at our fingertips whenever we need them. All of the students here are so supportive of all of the sports on campus. There is never an event here that is not completely packed."
College Student,5,"Busy Busy Busy! At MSA there's always something to do. We have a fitness center, outside basketball court, nice walk around the school, dance programs for all, and performances for all to attend, plus clubs galore!"
Junior,4,"I really enjoy Centenary College of Louisiana because of its culture, diversity, education and community that is intertwined within the school. At Centenary the students and professors work close together to achieve their ultimate goal of success. The community on this campus is open and inviting; which get many of the students involved in activities around the community. The environment is very inclusive and allows for an enjoyable time for all students."
Junior,4,Learning at Centenary College of Louisiana is mainly face to face classes. This is provides a great interaction and more one on one with the teacher with its average to small class sized depending on the course. Students are able to connect with the teachers and other students to help increase their performance in their classes. The professors are willing to help and listen to the students in need and offer support where they can.
Junior,4,Overall my time at Centenary has been pretty decent as it has been a place full of great memories and has allowed for me to make great friends.
Freshman,4,I like the atmosphere of family within the campus. everyone supports everyone through sports and clubs. If one thing should be changed is that there should be easier access to classes within the campus. All professors are great and the student life is wonderful. I can still enjoy food and certain places that might remind me as home so that is a plus especially being from California.
Freshman,4,"Centenary is a great place regarding any major an undergraduate chooses to pursue on the track to their career goals. But being on the pre med track as a biology and neuroscience major, I feel like I am getting the best experience and education out of my classes and labs that are available to me. After completing four years, all students will be prepared to enter their field of work or a graduate program."
Alum,4,"Centenary College was a great experience in my life.  I graduated in 1980 and again in 1984.  The value of the education at the time was great.  Seems that the costs now are too high for what you receive.  Having a college degree in a field that is in demand is key to success.  Centenary reviewed the degrees it offered a few years ago.  It eliminated the Education major, and with good merit.  Why would someone want to pay $25k plus each year/semester to get a job as a teacher making $40k a year.  Not cost effective.  Also, a number of years ago Centenary went from a Division 1 school to Division 3.  Many saw that as a mistake, and I agree.  Enrollment has dropped because of this.  However, it is still a good school overall."
Junior,4,Centenary is a private institution with a price tag to match. You pay for the academic opportunities  and experiences offered by the campus. It is made affordable and attainable by the scholarships they offer.
Senior,4,The faculty is what really makes this college unique! I have developed numerous relationships with the professors and they are my second family. I don't know where I would be without them!
Sophomore,4,"This college is great. My friends, and even some professor's, have become family. Here you really can have it all and some how mange to get sleep. I wouldn't change anything."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful small college that prides itself on being diverse and encourages everyone to participate in activities. The college is small but provides all the amenities of a larger university and gives students the ability to walk within 10 minutes from every location. The downsides to the school would be smaller grade sizes, smaller departments in need of faculty and current changes within the administration."
College Junior,4,"Love having small class sizes and being able to get to know all of my professors. They are difficult, but every professor wants the best for their students. If you aren't coming to class they'll contact you and ask why and if you're struggling they are more than willing to give you the help you need."
College Junior,4,We have DPS which is a 24/7 on campus police department that monitors parties and will give rides home to people so they don't have to walk alone. They also will help with whatever you need if you call them.
College Junior,4,"The Greeks at centenary definitely run the campus, but in a very positive manner. My sorority has various charity events that all of the student body can attend and it's always so much fun! Greek students are typically viewed as nice people who do a lot for the community. There is no Greek housing available at centenary, but we do have houses where we can hold rush events and meetings."
College Junior,4,"As a golfer at Centenary I think athletics are all around pretty good, the only struggle we have is funding some better opportunities because our school is so small. Our school spirit is great especially at basketball and gymnastic events. Athletic facilities are pretty good, but our gymnastic and golf team has to practice off campus which is really inconvenient."
College Junior,4,"I would choose Centenary over and over again because of the small class sizes and how much I am able to be involved. I play golf, am a student ambassador, and have an executive position in my sorority Zeta Tau Alpha. Not only am I able to be super involved, but I am also able to have the capability to do well academically. My school is also unique because I am able to get to know my teachers very well which will lead to great recommendations and further connections down the road."
College Sophomore,4,The number for DPS seems to be everywhere and it's great for if you don't have the number in your phone already.
College Sophomore,4,"As a music major, most of my classes have to do with music and the music professors are really great!"
College Sophomore,4,"Although I am not involved in many things on campus, everyone is very friendly and I really enjoy being here!"
College Freshman,4,Dps monitors campus all night and gives rides to people walking alone. Very safe.
College Freshman,4,Currently in a sorority here and it's a wonderful experience
College Freshman,4,Currently go here. Easy to learn. Very challenging and very involved. Professors know me personally and help me to succeed in every way. I experience many different classes along with going to Paris as modules. Experience is wonderful.
College Freshman,4,"We have a police department next to campus who are always walking around campus if anyone would need help, and they know how to handle difficult situations."
College Freshman,4,"It is great, you get to know a lot of people who really care about you and even the professors care about your performance in class. They make you feel they are interested in your success and will help you in anything they can."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of internships and volunteer work you can get involved into and base your future in those relationships you make in and outside of the school.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are amazing in here, the teams really are teammates, and family."
College Freshman,4,"Ii is a great and small school were teachers care about your success and you can get involved very easily in campus activities where you get to know a lot of people and make yourself known among them. This college encourages to do everything you can to make this campus a better place for us and the new students, it also encourages to do the best for the world through their internship and programs of sustainability, justice, and hope."
College Freshman,4,Shreveport is a rather urban city. But within campus parameters you wouldn't even know thanks to Campus PD.
College Freshman,4,I feel that the professionals at the school will guide me to a good career path.
College Freshman,4,My first semester went by rather smoothly.
College Freshman,4,"My school experience is awesome in college its everything i had hope for. The classes are amazing the teachers are perfect, when have so many fun things to do on campus, i wouldn't want to go know where else this school is perfect for me."
College Sophomore,4,Centenary College of Louisiana could not have been a better decision for me. The people are so welcoming and friendly. As a member of the choir I feel as though they are my family. My school is literally like a family. Everyone has seen and talked to everyone on campus at least once. No one is really a stranger.
College Junior,4,I love burgers at Strawn's and they have good pie but I prefer the pie from George's Grill it is heavenly.
College Junior,4,There were not a lot available when I start in the Fall of 2012 but they have gotten more in recent years.
College Junior,4,Its not strict at all.
College Junior,4,"We have very different types of boys and girls here at Centenary. We have the girly girls, athletics girls and guys, wild party people, gays and lesbians and so many more. Some are really attractive to sweet and handsome individuals. Our school tries to exemplify diversity in the student body."
College Junior,4,"Even though I haven't had an internship, I do plan to have one very soon. I know that having an internship is a very important part to gaining a job in my future. I did have concerns about finding an internship but now I have assistance for looking for internships. Hopefully i will be able to shadow a psychiatrist or psychologist since I am a psychology major."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The liberal arts curriculum demands brief stints of immersion in all aspects of study, which is great for the student who has many interests and isn't sure what they'd really like to pursue.  However, some of the music degree plans were extraordinarily encumbered, requiring the majority of music students to regularly apply for permission to take more than 18 hours per semester.  Other majors felt extended taking 16 credit hours at a time - which happened maybe twice throughout their college career.  The workload for some majors compared to others is laughable."
College Junior,4,The student life here is great there are buildings just for the students like the sub where students can go and check their mail and play pool or ping pong.  Its a great place to be a student really.  The cafeteria is also one of those places that you would think has terrible place to eat but really the food is awesome.
College Senior,4,"You have many options from French to Neuroscience and from Music to Biophysics.
Classes are often small and the learning environment is well above the average. Plus, you have a lot of study abroad programs that count towards your degree"
College Senior,4,Great Scholarship Opportunities If You Did Well – Good scholarship opportunities if you did well in school and SATs and ACTs
College Freshman,2,We often have leaks and flooding during bad weather.
College Junior,2,"I wouldn't describe Centenary as a ""party school"". The parties at the fraternity houses suck, and usually the same people are always there. Every once in a while someone will throw a party at the baseball/ soccer/ basketball house and those are always fun"
College Junior,2,Every year the increase the price of the meal plans under the guise that food service is improving and it has improved a little but not enough that it is worth the price I am paying
College Sophomore,2,"The campus cafeteria will only cook good food if prospective students come to visit. Most of the time, it's half cooked food or gross mystery meat. Some of the cafeteria workers are lazy and/or mean, sometimes putting food up and closing fifteen to thirty minutes early. There are hardly any healthy options, with the exception of making your own salad (which can be gross if the lettuce has been left out all day) or making your own sandwich. The expedition line, where you watch them make your food, is all right at best but I personally, got food poisoning after watching them cook my shrimp for me. Overall, the meal plan is not worth what we are served and the service we get."
College Sophomore,2,The computers are a little outdated and the internet is very slow. There is only one printer in the library and it jams quite often which is very inconvenient.
College Senior,2,"It's pretty serious if you get caught for drinking on-campus, you could easily lose your housing. You can always go to any of the greek parties where control on drinking is not as tight"
College Sophomore,2,"Kind of Boring – The student life here is somewhat boring. If you aren't involved in any of the organizations or activities that the campus has your college experience will not be a good one. However, there are some activities that are quite fun when many students come out to attend."
College Junior,2,Between a C and C – The food is definitely not the best thing on campus
College Sophomore,2,"If You Are from a Large City, Then Will You Be Bored! Shreveport has a great diversity of culture and a very rich history. Many people do not realize Shreveport's historical background. There are many ""historical sites"" to visit(if you are into that). If you are into more science and education, Shreveport offers a place called Sciport. It's for all ages and is so much fun! Maybe you like the club scene, or perhaps casinos. We have a vast amount of casinos and night entertainment all over the area. Honestly, unless you are 21 or over, there's not much left to do. Shreveport/Bossier has a Boardwalk for shopping and hanging out. There are a few malls around, but nothing too fancy. If you are from a large city, then you may not like Shreveport."
College Sophomore,2,Technology on Campus – Computers are very accessible in the library. Priting things off the computer is a whole different story!  The librar&#237;an is not very nice. It used to be that we could print things off ourselves but now the librar&#237;an got so mad from having to unjam the printer(her job) that one day she decided to move it behind her desk. Now she looks at and even gives her own 2 CENTS about what you are printing out. HELLO we are paying for this!! Wireless across campus is spotty. Wifi is hit and miss in the smith building and other outer buildings. It is a MUST though to have your own pc or mac. The library closes at 10 and is not even open on Saturdays.
College Sophomore,1,The food here would be better if the cafeteria people would learn how to cook things right. I don't want to have to eat a burger every single time I come in to the caf. The cakes are ALWAYS dry. I find that the only good options are the unhealthy foods. Sometimes the lettuce tastes like pesticides. On the weekend the food is just...terrible. Centenary needs to get their food together because I'm paying $2000 for crap.

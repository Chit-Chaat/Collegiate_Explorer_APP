Freshman,5,University of Portland quickly transitioned into a online learning system. The online orientation worked out very well and gave students an opportunity to meet each other
Freshman,5,"Very welcoming and great place, open to different cultures and nationalities all around the world. Even when school is online"
Freshman,5,Love the location and everyone is super friendly. Downtown is super easy to get to and public transportation is super easy to use. The bus system comes to the front of campus. On campus is super pretty. So far I have had a super good academic experience.
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and the environment is wonderful for learning. The small size provides small class sizes and lots of one on one learning time.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the personal experience of this University. You really get to create a personal relationship with every teacher and students and you are surrounded by help if you need it!
Niche User,5,I am not yet a student at UP but just in the time since I applied I  have experienced how amazing the people and the area around the school is.
Freshman,5,"I've made tons of friends here. Everyone, including my professors have been great and I've had the time of my life."
Freshman,5,Everyone on campus is super sweet! And classes and interesting and fun!! The school does a lot to keep everyone safe and theyâ€™re supportive with helping in every way they can.
Freshman,5,"It is the perfect sized school, big enough to meet new people, yet small enough classes to have connections with your professors. The professors here all care about you and your well being, and want to see you succeed. The support resources here are amazing as well"
Freshman,5,"Overall, I have really enjoyed my experience with University of Portland so far. I love the campus, the community, and the many different opportunities for students as well!"
Niche User,5,"I love the school, it has everything I am looking for in a college. It is class to my family but I can still live on campus. It is near the city but not right in the city. It has the major I am looking for and gives me credit from the IB Diploma."
Senior,5,"Attending the University of Portland has been a wonderful experience. The support across campus for students is unmatched; professors actually care about us, and if you need help in any way there are resources for you. In the way of diversity, UP is working to improve but has a long way to go. Overall, student organizations on campus work tirelessly to make UP a place where all are welcome, and it's been wonderful to see."
Freshman,5,"Campus Ministry and the Secondary Education program is most exciting. There are so many programs within Campus Ministry, and the Education program provides exceptional field time."
Niche User,5,I love it very good resources and great if you are in the medical area Lovely campus and good dorms If you are catholic University of Portland is the place to be because it is a catholic school and they keep the beliefs of the scholars which is very rare these days Great people there at the campus and good professors They are all generous people and they make you feel welcome
Freshman,5,"I love that the University of Portland has a very friendly environment. Due to the small student population, I feel a sense of inclusivity among the students. There are a lot of familiar faces when walking throughout the campus, and I love that everyone is so willling to get to know each other everyday. The university definitely feels like a community, and that is what I like most about the University of Portland."
Senior,5,"I was wait-listed for the University of Portland. Now that I am officially accepted, I am excited to attend!!"
Freshman,5,such a beautiful school and campus. so excited to be attending there nursing program next year. they are super helpful  with the whole application process and getting my major changed was super easy
Junior,5,"The nursing program is one of the best in the area, with newly renovated facilities. It is a smaller university, so you have more of an opportunity to develop relationships with professors and get involved with things on campus."
Freshman,5,"The University of Portland truly cares about each individual.They go out of the way to make sure your mental health is ok. The classes are small, so you get to know your teachers. its academically challenging,but I like the challenge."
Niche User,5,"I liked that the University wasn't very big. The campus was very well sized, not too big, not too small."
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far at UP has been great, the professors are incredibly knowledgeable about their subjects and are more than willing to help each of their students succeed in their classes, so long as they are willing to put in the work. Academics are great, the food on campus is somewhat limited day to day but it is still great quality food, and the campus itself is small but beautiful. The party life isn't that great, being an underclassman makes it difficult to get into parties but you just have to know the right people."
Senior,5,I love the University of Portland! The people are so friendly and the campus ministry program in particular has given me the most impactful experiences of my life.
Sophomore,5,University of Portland is a small and mighty wonderful college! I feel at home here and very connected. The professors and other staff at this school are some of the most genuinely caring and helpful people.
Freshman,5,I felt extremely welcomed the first time I stepped onto the campus and there are lots of opportunities to get to know other students. There's countless clubs and organizations to ensure every student is involved in some type of activity. I know that the professors and other faculty members are easily to talk to and I feel comfortable asking them for help. Even though it is a small school the campus feels very big and spacious.
Alum,5,I really loved the community. The faculty and students made me feel completely at home. I would like to see a salary increase for the wonderful professors employed at UP.
Freshman,5,University of Portland is this best place to be if you want to study in Portland. The campus has a beautiful river and wooded hills view. It is also removed from the unsavory aspects of the city. I wish the food choices were better and the dorms were updated but that's typical. If UP would add football to the sports line up it would be about perfect.
Sophomore,5,"It's a really small school, and it is really easy to stick with the same group of people, but don't. Branch out and you will meet the most amazing people in the entire world! Everyone is so kind and genuinely nice."
Niche User,5,"I liked the learning atmosphere, the academic opportunities, and the different ways that students can get involved in the community. I also really like the professor-led classes, which allow students to get first-hand lessons and students can be more proactive in the classroom. There is not much change that I would like to see because the University of Portland has exceeded my expectations."
Freshman,5,"University of Portland was my first choice school because it had everything I wanted. It has a good science department, small but large feel campus, and a good professor to student ratio. Class sizes are a good size where the professors know your name and want you to succeed. Sports wise it's not very good. The men's cross country team was the best sport as they got 2nd in the nation. The first few games are the most attended and then people stop going. There are not many parties, but you can find small house parties if you know the person. The food is descent at first, but gets worse as there are not many options. It defiantly gets better during visitation days, but all the others days it's okay."
Freshman,5,"When I first came here, it was the first time I had moved so I was very shy and timid and overwhelmed, but the staff and students and literally everyone here was so welcoming and great. I felt like I got a lot of information about the campus within just the first few days of being on the grounds. I made friends really quickly mostly because everyone was so nice, and probably just as scared as me. I liked that they ""required"" us to have a workshop group because it made us very close with a select group of people, of which most of the people in that class became some of my very best friends."
Freshman,5,"I love the small campus, yet it is big enough for me to not feel as though I'm being locked in to some place so small. It's in a great part of portland with easy access to a multitude of activities."
Freshman,5,"University of Portland is a great school that offers a wide variety of student activities and clubs. Academics at University of Portland is taken very seriously. Teachers are friendly and will be glad to help you out during office hours and set scheduled meetings. University of Portland is not a party school. Public safety on this campus do a great job of making sure students and guests are always feeling safe. The food here is good; we have a variety of food places around campus. Dorming is a bit expensive but all utilities are included along with great dorm mates. Overall, University of Portland is a great school"
Freshman,5,With a strong curriculum and a safe community of faith. this is a perfect school for those looking to go with God into their academic future.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Portland is a great academic institution. Because of it's smaller size, students have countless opportunities to grow and reach their potential. The professors are truly amazing and are dedicated to their field and helping students learn. The campus is beautiful, and there is a very friendly and welcoming culture all around. I believe that UP students are very well rounded and we find the perfect balance between work and play. Overall, choosing to attend the University of Portland was one of the best decisions that I ever made."
Junior,5,"University of Portland is an amazing college not only for the incredibly supportive faculty and professors but for the overall environment we have. I feel like we are family, we always smile and say hello--even to strangers, small classroom sizes make it easy to make friends and study groups and I love when we are all going crazy cheering on the team at soccer games. Our facilities are also superior to many of the other schools I've ever visited; our cafeteria has fresh, sustainable food, our library has amazing resources and our new gym is truly of high quality and maintained very well. I would also have to say the student government and clubs do an awesome job of providing the students with a great list of events through out the year such as our yearly traditional dances, carnival, concert and various other fun events--there's something cool going on almost every weekend."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman as UP, I am truly enjoying my experience. One thing that stands out to me is how tightly knit the community is. Moving almost a 1,000 miles away from home, the great community helped me to not feel so far away from home. I have already made so many amazing friendships. The classes that I am taking are extremely enjoyable. Most of my classes are pretty small and all of the my teachers know who I am, which is great for when I need help. The teachers are so passionate about their works which makes it so much easier to be engaged in what I am learning. In addition to great teachers, there are also many resources on campus to help students if they are struggling, which is great because it makes it that much easier to succeed."
Freshman,5,"I love this school, I can really tell that all of the faculty and staff really want to be here and want to see the students succeed. The programs are top notch, and the professors are all experts in their fields. The facilities are wonderful, though there are complaints typical to college campuses, such as limited food choices and outdated dorm buildings. The location is great, campus always feels safe. Though it is extremely expensive, I feel like attending this school will allow me more opportunities than students get at bigger institutions. I would recommend this school to everyone."
Freshman,5,"Despite the fact that the University is Catholic-affiliated,  everybody is friendly and welcoming regardless of race, gender, religion, etc. Even better, the University not only provides numerous fields of study, but also requires students to take classes from many liberal arts fields, creating a wide knowledge base."
Freshman,5,The school is great. It has a friendly community of people and great extra curricular activities. Everyone knows everyone but it is big enough that you can avoid people if you want to. There are stores close by to get shopping done.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Portland is a great school. Being a small campus, students have the opportunity to get to know their peers and professors on a more personal level compared to large campuses - where students often are lost in a sea of faces. Students have a voice - they can make an impression on the university when they get together and make a movement. Security is constantly roaming around campus and nearby neighborhoods, which makes me feel safe walking around alone or at night. Classes are diverse and the professors are great overall."
Freshman,5,"Nice campus. I like the smaller class sizes because you get more one on one with professors. Food is provided by Bon Apetit  and is delicious (all organic). Portland is fun to explore, lots of outdoor activities and festivals year round."
College Sophomore,5,"People are able to attend big basketball games and soccer games (trust me they're awesome), but there are also a lot of people that don't go because sports isn't their style. Intramural sports are incredibly awesome as well!"
College Sophomore,5,"University of Portland is the best school for me because it is small enough where you are able to have a great relationship with the professors, and have friends in all of your classes, while giving somewhat of a larger school feel with the school spirit and growing size of the school."
College Freshman,5,"I mean I chose this school for a reason, because I LOVE IT"
College Freshman,5,I fell completely safe probably the most safe I have felt since I was a kid
College Freshman,5,I love the relationship between professor and student. They get to know you by name and care about your success.
College Sophomore,5,"Public Safety does a great job of making sure they patrol the campus very frequently and there are different modes of reaching public safety to ensure a secure campus. At the beginning of the school year, all freshman are introduced to the green dot program, which focuses on spreading safety and community throughout the campus, and this program was very frequently used and reminded of through signs and different programs."
College Sophomore,5,"There is a new athletic facility for students that are not athletes, and the availability of different fitness is classes is very diversified and many students take advantage of the new facility. I used it almost everyday, and the hours are really accomadating to those who have early or late classes. Team performances are relatively average, and the most popular sport that is attended is the soccer games."
College Freshman,5,"I honestly have loved every professor I have had so far, they are all extremely nice"
College Freshman,5,I have never heard of someone getting sexual assaulted at UP
College Freshman,5,It's a small school but it doesn't feel like one
College Freshman,5,I feel like I will find a job easily when i graduate
College Freshman,5,Love the school and the people
College Junior,5,Every student is a huge fan of the athletes here on campus. Great support all around. Athletes seem to be happy about being on the team.
Recent Alumnus,5,I don't have anything to say here.
Recent Alumnus,5,I really don't have anything to say here.
Recent Alumnus,5,I don't have anything to say here.
College Sophomore,5,"No, it is not Harvard or Yale in reputation, but UP will give me a degree I will be able to use. The schools of engineering and nursing have connections to the Portland area and beyond. A degree from UP is highly valued by employers."
College Freshman,5,The professors are passionate about their areas of study. Every time I walk into my classroom I feel like I want to know the information. They also continue to say hello if they see me on campus. I would definitely choose Yours school again because we are like a family.
College Freshman,5,I feel very secure on campus. The security team works hard to keep us students safe.
Junior,4,"I enjoy the opportunities this university provides. the student body is comparatively small in relation to public universities which allows a more personal academic experience. the faculty is eager to assist students in progressing their careers and will go out of their way to help a student succeed. the largest downfall is the cost. it is a private university so in comparison to public colleges, you will need a substantial increase in financial aid."
Freshman,4,So far everything has been good. Lots of zoom classes. The professors have responded super fast to emails.
Senior,4,I only took my courses online for the second half of Spring 2020 due to COVID-19. The university was not prepared for this changer since we do not have an online school. They handled it well and most professors went over and above to compensate.
Senior,4,I love the university and all my classes! Overall professors are outstanding. The campus is BEAUTIFUL. The only reason it has 4/5 stars is because it is EXPENSIVE.
Freshman,4,So far so good! Better instructions for first-year students regarding enrollment would be beneficial.
Freshman,4,I have not started my first classes yet but I am eager to begin! There nursing program has had positive reviews from all alumni I have discussed it with!
Sophomore,4,"The University of Portland is a great school for people looking to acquire their BSN with a close net group of passionate people. As a small school, there is a limited amount of opportunities, however, if you are highly motivated you will go far."
Senior,4,"Great professors and academics. It is a relatively small campus with very limited resources, however, the professors and the counselors are great at helping you find opportunities for work and research."
Niche User,4,"It's pretty good, ya know? It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?It's pretty good, ya know?"
Freshman,4,"University of Portland is a very expensive school but if you find the means and have an opportunity to go here you should if you want a small, close knit community. It's pretty religious and do not go here if you are looking for a big party scene or really active social life."
Alum,4,"The University of Portland has great professors and I feel like I learned a lot. I wish that they had more liberal views on sexual health, but being a Catholic University they have a very limited role in that arena."
Sophomore,4,"Professors care about their students and most of them teach very well. However, there aren't enough professors for some classes which makes it difficult to make your schedule."
Sophomore,4,"Fantastic nursing school, great facilities, and lovely faculty. Annoying that theology is mandatory but you have to pick your battles."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy UP. The food is okay, the staff is very friendly, and the dorms are very different from one another."
Junior,4,"University of Portland is a school set on the beautiful bluff of Portland, however it is quite expensive and the small size of the school factors into the resources available."
Junior,4,"UP is expensive, but depending on what youâ€™re majoring in it can be worth it. They are well known for their Engineering, Business, and Nursing schools. If you arenâ€™t planning on majoring in one of those three UP might not financially be right for you. Dorm life isnâ€™t bad but the food there is pretty over priced for what it is. To me it appears that when there are campus tours the food is extremely better than what it normally is. Professors are very helpful and nice and truly want whatâ€™s best for you as a student. Off campus life is good. There are quite a few decent restaurants and food trucks that arenâ€™t badly priced. There is a Fred Meyer that is close to campus and they arenâ€™t badly priced. There is also a popular bar, The Twilight Room, about a mile off campus that many UP students go to that have different events each night that are fun to experience, once youâ€™re 21 of course."
Junior,4,"My experience at UP so far has been really great. I love the beautiful campus and the community that the smaller college gives. The housing is pretty good and I enjoy all of the classes that I am taking and will be taking the coming up year. I wish the food was better,  but other than that, UP is awesome."
Freshman,4,The professors and students there are very friendly. They are willing to help others. The environment there is very safety and peaceful. One change is to make University of Portland more diverse.
Junior,4,"The campus family is fantastic, and the classes are amazing. Professors really care about each individual and foster an inclusive and diverse learning environment. The student body is really involved and there are lots of opportunities for participation in things you care about, whether it be sports, politics, theater, books, organization, or anything else."
Junior,4,"Most of the professors are amazing, incredibly knowledgeable and involved in their field. Small classes means student involvement and a good environment for questions.
The downside for me is that SOME of the theology (required) professors are more into preaching their views then teaching about the subject"
Junior,4,"UP is great because it is such a tight knit community. With that being said, it is not diverse. It is a predominately white campus, so it's hard to fit in if you aren't that. People are extremely welcoming, but come from privileged backgrounds, so it can be hard for them to relate to you, or us to them."
Freshman,4,The school is located in a safe area.  The other students and the professors are very respectful. The campus and facilities are beautiful as well.
Junior,4,"University of Portland has excellent professors. Each professor is committed to teaching first, and classes are never taught by TAs. University of Portland also gives students real-life experience as undergraduates, from education majors teaching in classrooms in the Portland area, to nursing students doing hospital clinical, and conducting students running their own ensembles. University of Portland also offers a year-long study abroad program in Salzburg, Austria. You can immerse yourself in Austrian culture for nine months and expand your knowledge of Austrian history and the German language."
Freshman,4,"I love the openness of teachers, they are always open to have conversations and help you in any way. There are so many ways to find support around campus that you don't feel so alone. I would like to see a better variety of food on campus."
Freshman,4,"My goal is to work abroad, so i chose somewhere close to home. UP is pricey but the education and level of attention you receive from your professors is better than anything my friends at state school will get. The campus is small/cliquey and besides living in a dorm, itâ€™s like high school. People at the school are inexperienced and in all honesty the student body is weird. There are parties to go to if you hunt them down. In February, parties become extremely rare and itâ€™s all about dorm storming. I just wait till breaks to party at state schools. In a nutshell, this school is here to give you a degree thatâ€™ll make you stand out. If youâ€™re like me and you can handle suffering a little to get what you want, then come to this school. You might get a little depressed but that comes with transitioning to adulthood. I like to put it into perspective and remember that at least Iâ€™m studying abroad and Iâ€™m completely gonna go off at every club in Europe."
Alum,4,"My experience at university was extremely formative and I'm grateful for the many opportunities I had. However, I believe that the university has very many issues including lack of diversity, lack of transparency, and other social justice issues that create a stifling or toxic environment for very many students and community members."
Junior,4,"The University of Portland has vibrant campus life, tries its best to be inclusive, has a good student to professor ratio, decent on-campus dining, and a great location, but administration could work on its awareness and addressing of social and political issues that affect its students. Academics here are fantastic because class sizes are relatively small, making it easy to build a relationship with professors and excel in courses. Also, there is a wide selection of clubs and extracurricular activities. The school is working on creating more diversity in every possible way, although it is not as diverse as some other small private universities. Overall, most students thrive at this school socially and academically."
Sophomore,4,"There are so many extracurricular activities apart from academics so you can never be bored on campus. The people, professors, and alumni are well mannered and nice people. I've never had a problem with my professors but other students is a different story."
Junior,4,"Beautiful campus, everyone is very friendly and welcoming.  The community is wonderful and everyone is inclusive. Tons of trees, great professors who are very knowledgable."
Sophomore,4,"I finished my first year at the university of Portland and I really enjoyed it. The campus is just stunning every season of the year, the class sizes are small, where you are able to get one on one with your professors, I feel like the classes really set you up to become a better person."
Freshman,4,"My first year in University of Portland has been amazing so far. I got lucky with my dorm choice because everybody on my floor has just been great people and I feel blessed to be able to call them my friends, the academics have also been great and the teachers have been some of the most helpful and passionate educators I have ever met."
Niche User,4,After receiving a generous scholarship I came in for a tour. Everyone was very nice and the campus was beautiful. I didnâ€™t get the traditional collegiate feel that you get in a college town.
Freshman,4,"I have loved my UP experience so far! My roommate and all the peers I have run into are decent people, if not really nice and friendly. Campus is small, which Is a bit of a personal negative, but itâ€™s gorgeous and most of the time I am really thankful itâ€™s so quick to get around. My professors have been friendly, genuinely passionate about their subjects and invested in my progress. The food is AMAZING for campus food - It regularly changes and encompasses different ethnic foods. 
For the School of Education specifically, I can say the advisors are quirky and fun and up for casual check ins and in prompt to drop ins from their advisees. No where is perfect but I honestly can say I wouldnâ€™t have chosen anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful, but there are limited options for eating on campus. The professors are all very knowledgable and nice, and many provide options to really understand the course material. The dorms vary in quality and it is a bit unfair that students have to pay the same amount for housing."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman here at UP and so far I love it. The upperclassmen, professors, and staff are nice and welcoming. The dorms are ok most don't have AC but the space is a good size. The professors are tough but willing to work with you almost anytime."
Sophomore,4,"I transferred to UP from another school in Oregon and have not regretted my decision. In fact, I knew from the moment I was accepted that this school was outstanding. Right from the beginning they really took an interest in me and my education. The faculty is extremely helpful and accessible and pushes the students to be their best every day. My professors are intelligent and want all of their students to succeed, and they are always available to meet with us when we need help."
Junior,4,"University of Portland is perfect for students who want a vigorous curriculum, invested professors, and a cozy environment. The campus is absolutely stunning, with beautiful architecture and nature making up the grounds. The dorms quickly provide a sense of community, filled with abundant fun and friendship. The catering company that supplies all of the food establishments on campus does not really have a wide variety of options even if they claim to. Diversity is also something that could be improved upon; there is a severe lack of different varying background in both students and faculty."
Sophomore,4,I chose this school because I wanted to go to a Catholic school that offers a highly academic and socially welcoming environment. The University of Portland provides this and more!
Niche User,4,"There arw numerous amount of things I liked about U of P! I loved how they have a new rec center. I love the feel of college life even though it's a smaller university because it's a religious one. I love how there are so many different clubs there are. I also love the different jobs on campus there is and how you can do your school work during that time. In addition,  I love how they have a church on campus so if you want to go to pray and/or go attend you can. What I do not like is how thry have a co-ed dorm on campus. I do not like how they have very low diversity in campus too. I wish there was a lot more diversity on campus. Overall, I gave it 4 stars because it is a great university and I hope I get in next summer!"
Sophomore,4,"The University of Portland is small but unique. Portland is a wonderful location for students because, even when the campus seems small, it is not difficult to get off campus and go explore the city. 

There is some, but not a lot, of diversity in the student body, which is something the University is looking to expand."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus with great sense of community, healthy food, small population, secluded area of a big city, and knowledgeable professors."
Freshman,4,So far my first year at UP has been an amazing experience. I've made many new friends and learned a lot from my classes. Very rewarding academically if you are committed.
Freshman,4,The University of Portland is a good school overall. The professors are very understanding of the workload that a student it given and in addition they offer a lot of help.
Sophomore,4,"UP is perfect if you want a small, community based school. The people are delightful and despite UP being a private school, they don't really force religion on you. The only thing I don't like is the strictness of the dorm life and the required theology courses."
Niche User,4,"Really friendly people, and located in an awesome city. It's a school and city where nobody is afraid to be themselves. Everyone is accepted and nobody is judged."
Sophomore,4,I love this college. It is a small college so it is easy to connect with people and meeting with professors is very easy. I haven't had a class size over 30 students and everyone is incredibly nice. I just wish that there was more parking for the commuter students.
Junior,4,"I love the community at the University of Portland, overall the university is tight knit and within the greater UP community, smaller groups also have their own communities. It seems like everyone has a place to call home on campus and it is great being supported by my peers and supporting them."
Freshman,4,"I like how beautiful the campus is. The food is awesome, but pretty expensive. Most teachers are very helpful and encouraging for my success. There are a ton of student activities I can choose to attend and there is also a lot of volunteer opportunities through the various student run clubs."
Junior,4,Best BSN program in Oregon! Also one of the few that does a transfer degree from Paramedic to BSN. Very helpful in the transition.
Alum,4,"The University of Portland is a great school. The campus is located in a quiet neighborhood just outside of St. Johns which has shopping, cafe's and great food. The university has great professors who take the time to get to know you and care about helping you succeed. Bon Appetite caters the meals and they are delicious, seriously get the cove fries. They won't let you down. The facilities are great, they have been renovating so that means new residence halls new gym and a new library just to name a few. The resources that are open to you including tutoring, the writing center and the career center make succeeding at the university a piece of cake. "
College Freshman,4,The school really helps you find a job and internship so it isn't a problem
College Freshman,4,"Awesome! But i just wanted AC in my residence hall, which I did not get"
College Freshman,4,We have the best fan club! Like we've won awards and everything. It's an enjoyable experience for those on the field and off.
College Junior,4,My personal high school experience was a good as I could have made it with the teachers I respected to prepare me for college.
College Sophomore,4,"I have not done any jobs or internships in relation to the University of Portland, but the students that I do know that work on campus for the school or have internships through the school have greatly enjoyed it. In the business school, which I am enrolled in, the alumni network had many opportunities throughout the year that students could come and listen to, which I thought was extremely beneficial and something that I had not experienced before."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors at the university hold their students to a very high standard from my experience. One of the major adjustments that I found between high school and college was not the work load has increased, but the quality of work that I turned in and submitted had to be much higher in order to get the better grades. However, at UP, there are three religion classes that are required for graduation. I am not Catholic, and going through these classes I thought was hard to follow not knowing the background of the religion very well, which I think the curriculum could do a better job at, seeing how every student has to go through these classes. The religion classes also were a lot of reading that would have been more applicable to a course that is a 200 level class, not necessarily at 100 level religion class."
College Sophomore,4,"Last year I lived in Fields Hall, currently the newest dorm hall on campus. I greatly enjoyed the cleanliness and quality of the building, but I do know that some of the other hall dorms were not as neat or clean. The housing process was a little difficult for the following year however. The school usually does a pretty good job of getting out the deadlines that are necessary for students via student email, but when it came to the housing process, the deadline was announced rather late. This made it almost impossible for freshmen to realize that they needed to look for houses very early if they wanted to secure housing off campus. It is required that students know what they are doing for housing for the following year, and because of this, many students end up living on campus again their sophomore year(and therefore paying more money to the university)."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the school, much greater than I thought I would. Our school is unique because the school is much smaller than a state school, therefore the classes are much smaller. Because of this, and because we are on a semester rather than quarter system, it is very easy to develop personal relations with the professors. This makes it easier to communicate with the teachers, as well as be held accountable in and out of class. For this reason, I would choose the school over again."
College Senior,4,"Public Safety and UP staff is always on the look out for drugs, so be careful for watchful eyes."
College Sophomore,4,No pressure to drink since parties suck you aren't really missing out
Niche User,2,"I hated this school. It cares very little, if not at all, about students' mental health--the Health & Counseling Center knows very little about some things which makes it really difficult to keep going, not to mention if you need to go you'll have to wait 2 weeks to get in. The campus is so small, you are guaranteed to pass by someone you know on your way to class. The academics are good and so are the professors, but overall it's a dreary, depressing, overcast, expensive, DEPRESSING place to live for 4 years and I would never go back. The dorms suck and the only good ones are on the edge of campus. Party scene is almost nonexistent, students basically end up drinking in their dorms every weekend because the house parties get shut down by 11pm. RA's are all snitches. The food is terrible, and everything is overpriced. Me and so many of my friends hate the school and I know a fair share of people who dropped out after the first semester. I'm glad I left. This place sucks."
Junior,2,"Do not go to University of Portland if you are looking for an equitable and diverse space to learn!! I made a few friends during my couple years there, but for the most part I felt isolated as someone that didn't grow up with money, at a private school, or with the assumption that I would attend a nice university. It seemed that everyone I met had a secure family life and were just then getting their first job. 
UP is catching on that ""diversity"" is going to make them a more likable university, but it's still run by wealthy white men. Additionally, I never had a professor of color at UP. Two of my professors were amazing, but the rest were either average, awful, or all about girl-power-white-feminism. 
There ARE good things at UP. Campus is beautiful (and being constantly watered.) However, it's an expensive private Catholic university, what do you expect?
One last thing: don't get me started on UP's support of rapists. Yikes."
Sophomore,2,There is not a lot of diversity in this university. When it comes to getting help financially they aren't willing to help and tell you to basically figure it out if you can't afford it.
Sophomore,2,"The racial demographic is very basic, no real diversity. There is a large caucasian, Hawaiian and Guamanian population but everything else makes up less then 8 % of the student body. Outside of the soccer games there is a lack of school spirit and the food is terrible. The only time Bon Appetite changes the food options and increases the quality of meals is during student visitation days. (How convenient). Also food within the market place is incredibly overpriced (eg: Avocados are 5 dollars). Psafe as well has a terrible disciplinary system and need a new and more efficient disciplinary structure."
Sophomore,2,"Definitely feels more like high school than college. Great academics, but definitely don't come here if you're looking for the full college experience. Parties get shut down by 10. The food sucks, and sports do also."
College Sophomore,2,No tailgates. No football. All they have is soccer in an okay stadium.
College Sophomore,2,I want to transfer. Community is pretty superficial. Reminds me of the worst aspects of high school... Academics are alright nothing to get excited about.
College Senior,2,"We don't have Greek life, but I think many students think we should."
College Senior,2,"Honestly, there is absolutely no Greek Life here. The closest to it is the general personalities of the dorms on campus -- the female dorms turn into a sorority and the male dorms turn into fraternities. There are also a lot of parties off campus, but they do not create a community, they are mostly to get dangerously drunk and trash the neighborhood."
College Freshman,2,"There is a fine for pretty much everything the you could do wrong. Oh, you propped this door open? Here's a $100 fine."
College Senior,2,Its hard to find a house and the landlords are practically useless
College Senior,2,There are not many options to do research with students
College Sophomore,2,"I was very surprised and kind of scared to find out that UP is mostly white people. I have always gone to schools that are extremely diverse, and when I arrived at UP I found out that I was the minority it totally blew my mind. But the reality check, helped me meet wonderful people, who are interested in learning about my culture."
College Sophomore,2,"Very homogenous in terms of race, ethnicity, economic status, and sexual orientation. Most are fairly wealthy WASPS."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm in business and am looking forward to transferring out of that program. The introductory business class that all freshmen have to take is a joke. We literally spent a class building a tower out of dice as part of a team-building exercise The papers are long and the professor barely looks at them. 95% of the class can be aced based on common sense. The actual learning aspect about different areas of business that we read about in our textbook is only worth 5% of our grade. They only let you take introductory marketing, accounting, etc. classes during your sophomore year."
College Sophomore,2,"Rains almost nonstop from October to April. It usually snows for a few days each winter with mild accumulation. I'm from Portland so I'm used to it, and in fact I kind of like it. But I'm sure for most people it's a pain. Bring a durable, warm rain jacket or coat. Using umbrellas is frowned upon, unfortunately, especially for guys. The end of August and most of September is pretty warm though. March and April are on and off - a lot of days you can wear shorts and a t shirt."
College Sophomore,2,I'm in the business program and am in the process of transferring out. The introductory business course is a joke. We participated in a team building exercise that involved building a tower out of dice. The papers were long and barely looked at by the professor. 95% of the class could be aced with common sense reasoning skills. The things that we actually had to study for - reading quizzes - were worth 5% of our grade. Everything was easy to BS. The professor let us out after 20 minutes most of the time. They don't let you take introductory accounting or marketing classes until sophomore year.
College Sophomore,2,"UP has a large amount of computers on campus, but they are all very old and the network connection in most areas of the school is weak.  It is often a struggle to stream short videos on Youtube, and the login system is slow.  We are provided with an abundance of printing money, assuming that printing is done in moderation."
College Senior,2,"It has prevented me, who is 22 from having a good time, even though I am of age and responsible."
College Freshman,2,I can throw better parties than the off-campus house holders. I'm a freshman.
College Freshman,2,"The speed and reliability of the network is the most problematic thing for students across campus. It is mostly very good, but there are some days and times when it is the worst thing ever and students across campus cannot do their homework."
College Sophomore,2,Rooms are small and expensive. Some are old.
College Freshman,2,There are off campus parties but you have to know someone to get in. There are few dorm parties as the dorms are pretty strict on alcohol in them. I wouldn't come here if you are looking for a party scene.. 
College Junior,2,"It is so expensive. The options are limited. Honestly, not worth the cost."
College Sophomore,2,The wi-fi is horrible. To use the internet takes forever to load if it even does. There are a lot of computer labs and places to print. Each semester students get $10 of printing money and if you go over that you do have to pay to print on the school printers.  
College Sophomore,2,"It's a very white and upper-middle class university. Little ethnic diversity, yet the ones that are here seem to only hang out with each other and not branch out. As for religion, if you are not catholic or christian I would NOT to you to come here. You will have to take various courses on christianity and there is not a lot of room for accepting religions outside of that. Also, if you are not aware or tolerant of the catholic religion's beliefs, I would say not to go here. Yes, there are ways around it and to ignore it but it's an old school catholic university and you will notice it. Lastly, sexual orientation is always a struggle as well. Students are accepting of it however the presidents, some profs and priests are not. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school enforces many policies and rules regarding to underage drinking, drug use, and of course, inter visitation hours of opposite genders in the dorms. This is a private catholic school and therefore, there were policies pertaining to the Catholic beliefs."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of diversity, people tend to come from richer families, and similar areas."
College Sophomore,2,All majors are fantastic here. However they are very generalized and do not branch out into areas of speciality
College Senior,2,"The campus seems to be very strict on residence life policies if you live in the dorms. I felt very restricted when I lived in the dorms and I strongly disliked the fact that there are intervisitation hours where people (including people living in other dorms) can only visit during certain hours. They are somewhat understanding as far as alcohol violations go and it is better to get caught with residence life than the Portland Police. It's nearly impossible to have an off-campus party without it getting busted by Public Safety, even if you are responsible with your noise levels."
College Freshman,2,"It really depends on where you are and what you are doing. My hall director was incredibly strict and got me in trouble for an inter-visitation violation for 7 minutes past the set time. But my friend's hall director was the most relaxed guy I had ever met. Public Safety (the on campus police) are kind of hit and miss. Sometimes they are there, sometimes they aren't. Honestly, just don't be stupid. If you are obvious about breaking a rule, you will probably be caught or reported."
College Freshman,2,"It's great at first, but I'm guessing like all campus food, the food in the commons gets old and fast. It's nice that they try to mix it up in the middle of the term and have some great and delicious options. However, it seems that during midterms and finals the food choices are not that good and are scarce."
College Freshman,2,Campus is relatively far from other dining options.
College Junior,2,Very strict for on-campus drinking / drug use. Off campus the campus police tend to just break parties up and tell them to go home when things get loud or out of control.
Recent Alumnus,2,Some diversity except a predominantly white and upper middle and high class students.  Acceptance of diversity in terms of sexual orientation was not as supported.  Diversity events took place but I felt like most students attended these events for superficial reasons like to eat or see entertainment versus learn a culture.
College Freshman,2,"Alcohol policy - get moved to another dorm if caught.
Really depends on your hall RA.
Mehling is a bitch."
College Freshman,2,I'm not excessively happy with this school nor am I extremely disappointed. I feel like I'm just passing through here.
College Freshman,2,"At least half seem to be white catholics-

Everyone seems to come from Seattle area, or California.

Many people from Hawaii as well."
College Freshman,2,"Many drink, and drugs are seen as an obscene, obnoxious activity.

My RA once said,""you can make decent decision while drinking, which is why the policy isn't zero tolerance on that. You CANNOT make any good decisions on drugs or marijuana. We have a zero tolerance policy."""
College Senior,2,"Only Buissness Greeks â€“ There is only one fraternity on campus and it is built on strictly academics.  This does not mean that they are not successful, with their yearly trips and alumni programs in stock trade and managing hedge funds."
College Sophomore,1,Basically all the parties are shut down by P-safe then you end up roaming the streets of north Portland in the rain drunk. End up eating a quesadilla and chicken strips bc of the depressingly awful nightlife. This happens every weekend...No one goes to bars/clubs.
College Sophomore,1,Parties are bad. You get drunk and are just roaming campus/north Portland drunk. The parties there are people act snobby and judgmental. Not welcoming to freshmen at all. Basically a high school social scene.
College Freshman,1,Public safety is a joke.  I went to them when I didn't feel safe with another student sexually assaulting me and they told me to suck it up.  They get off on trying to break up house parties of 20 somethings who don't even go to UP and neglect their own students.
College Freshman,1,MIDNIGHT MASS PARTY HARD there's actually no party scene this is a lie.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a Greek Life on my campus.
College Senior,1,Constantly having issues and very expensive to print.
College Senior,1,Rains a lot and can get very depressing.
College Freshman,1,"We don't have a Greek life. This extremely affects the spirit at our school. I feel if we had a Greek life, the spirit would increase."
College Junior,1,One of the worst things about the school is the lack of diversity. 
College Junior,1,"They don't give new transfer students priority registration over new freshmen. They basically have any random person who is available arrange your classes with random professors and at random times. If you ask for class changes into different courses (which you also need to meet the requirements for so there should be no reason why you couldn't switch into the class...especially if the class has 10 OPEN SEATS), they don't care. Only their opinion matters--they know best because they are older--even if you are following the guidelines for what classes you need to graduate in your major and in your college. I was looking forward to being at a university where I am looked at as a person and not a number... I feel like I'm a number at university of Portland and classes haven't even begun yet. I had more value to my opinion at my 20,000 student community college. Universities that don't care about transfer students do not get a good grade--I don't care about their excuses. Obviously, they need to prioritize their registration system better for transfer students v. freshmen. I pay SO much money, and to have this type of treatment and not even be considered is ridiculous... I feel like I've been treated like a child at University of Portland... and I am far from a child."
College Junior,1,The policy on marijuana is extremely strict at the school. If you are caught drinking on campus underage you get a warning yet if you are caught smoking on or off campus 90% of the time it is an immediate one year suspension from school extremely debilitating these students futures and careers.
College Freshman,1,"There is not many diversity at this school, there are mainly caucasians."
College Freshman,1,"Public Safety Is Very Strict â€“ Two RA's on every floor of every dorm building. Public safety officers are always driving around, or sitting in their cars in areas where students frequently walk.  Public safety has been known to wait for intoxicated students returning to campus on weekends and issue MIPs.  Public safety will conduct room searches based only on tips from other students.  Punishment for alcohol is sometimes lenient, punishment for marijuana possession is always severe, often resulting in expulsion for first time offenses.  Not 420 friendly whatsoever."
College Freshman,1,Pretty much not a diverse campus. Lots of white students mainly. We have a lot of hawaiians but thats our biggest group.
College Sophomore,1,I feel discriminated by white people. No real asians only Hawaian. I need to get out of here
College Freshman,1,"Alcohol and Marijuana â€“ There is a lot of drinking that goes on. Weed is popular too. Peer pressure isn't an issue, people who want to use will and people who don't won't. Drug policies are strict, but it's hard to enforce."
College Sophomore,1,"At the University of Portland policies are tough as it gets. Underage drinking is scene as an extreme offense. If caught you may face the punishment of fines, losing your housing, then becoming expelled. You also have certain rules that are a little overboard. For instance, visitation hours are strictly enforced. Fines are often given out for this offense. But this is something to expect when applying to a private university."
College Student,1,There is rarely parking on campus and around the area since Portland is a very busy city. As a freshman you cannot park on campus.

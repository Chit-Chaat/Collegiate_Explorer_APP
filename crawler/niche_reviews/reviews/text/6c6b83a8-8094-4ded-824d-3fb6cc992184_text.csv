Senior,5,I love the convenience of online classes. The curriculum is challenging for an online platform which is a plus.
Senior,5,"The online learning experience through Moodle has been positive, user-friendly and easy to navigate."
Senior,5,"As a child, I took swimming classes and tap classes at this location. Growing up sitting in the classroom for my undergraduate degree gave me a sense of home. This same university gave me talents I took into my adulthood and now it’s teaching my talents I have for my career path."
Junior,5,"The professors are interested in your success.some will go over and beyond to ensure you learn, retain and understand the material."
Alum,5,CSU is a great. I like the diversity and the passion the teachers have to teach.  I also like that they have a bus that come on campus and take you to the train.
Niche User,5,my experience with csu is good all the staff are good people and its a very piece motivated area. I am a senior in high school and I would love to attend csu when I graduate and live in Chicago when I graduate I think that me attending csu would really widen my horizon and really let me adventure out of my comfort in a new area and a brand new begging and new start and really let me grow as a person and as a young adult I feel as though my experience at csu will really be life changing for the good and expose me to a whole new world where I never thought existed
Freshman,5,I’ve gained alot of love for Chicago State University. They make sure their students are good to go in any situation. Especially since I am an athlete they are always there for me. If I need a class change or help with my dorm room. They always put us first.
Senior,5,Chicago State is very diverse and affordable I love attending Chicago State because it convenient I get to attend classes offered in the evening geared towards adult learners
Junior,5,I like Chicago State University because It is accessible to where I love. I love that it has classes that are for older adults. I enjoy the online classes as well as the in house classes. The professors are very understanding and patience with the students. I an going to graduate from Chicago State University.
Senior,5,"If you really want a university that cares for their students and that students education excellent,  emotional well being, and social foundation, Chicago State University is the place for that degree opportunity. Go and register @ CSU.edu"

Senior,5,"I absolutely love Chicago State University. The south of Chicago is so underestimated, but there are so many great things happening here especially at CSU. I’m in the CMAT department and I have the BEST professors in the world. I wish we had more access to theatre classes though, but over all it has been one of the greatest experience of my education journey thus far. The tuition is also very affordable. The Greek life is also really good. I can go on and on about the good happening at this school. Great place to be."
Senior,5,"I love the teachers at Chicago State University, I'm in the Public Health division, and the professors really take their time with teaching you the school work."
Junior,5,The professor at Chicago State University cares about all their students. Attending my second semester here all my professor have went above and beyond for me with my overall academics in class. Being a Biology Major the department has provided so many resources and activities to help us understand our career path even more.
Senior,5,"more student activities,more finical aide to students in the humanities. better student involvement in the community. the art department needs more professional artists to lecture on campus. better food selection and longer hours."
Freshman,5,its is a family and bonding school everybody there would break there necks to help you be successful. i cant tell you how it is at chicago state university because me and you are different people my experience was amazing .you have to experience it
Niche User,5,"My experience at Chicago State University was Amazing!! The teacher and staff are amazing and very helpful and understanding. The students are also very helpful and understanding.  The dorm rooms are great, the food is great, and the parties and events are great too. I love everything about Chicago State University and I'll love to go back."
Senior,5,"I love how they offer a variety of degree programs. They also have friendly staff who help you to meet your needs, teachers who care and want to see you succeed. I also love the low cost for tuition. The only thing that I believe should change is the requirement to have a student pin to register when the upcoming semester is approaching."
Junior,5,I love that Chicago State has a very small environment. I practically know everyone on campus and the staff has always been friendly to me. Whenever I have a problem I can count on the staff and faculty at Chicago State to help me out.
Senior,5,"I love attending Chicago State University. I was a little weary about it at first. After about a week of school I realized that this was definitely the school for me.
It has understanding teachers and friendly students. It was very easy to feel at home at this University."
Senior,5,I love how the professor's help to encourage you to keep trying and never give up. Their are a lot of good mentors that will make sure that you are equipped to further your studies and have a good reference to refer back to. I recently encountered a problem with my research are and it was quickly rectified by one teacher's action and everything worked out for the est.
Sophomore,5,I love Chicago State University and it's some great professor. I plan to go back one day to finish my bachelor's  degree  soon.
Junior,5,"I had good experience at Chicago State.  The reason I choose Chicago State is because, they have the courses that I needed.  I am to the end of school, and now I have ran out of funds.  In order for me to continue my education, I need help.  Other than that I can't continue my education.  So I am asking for help.  I am a A student.  My GPA is 2.8.  I also work for Chicago State, as work study student.  So I am asking for you all to please consider me in this scholarship."
Senior,5,"My overall experience has been challenging but rewarding. I am constantly pushed out of my comfort zone daily. As time progressed, I have come out of my shell and have been more vocal in class. I feel confident that upon graduation this Spring, I will be most certainly ready to take on the new challenges of starting my career."

Recent Alumnus,5,"I would say my favorite spot is the library. It is four stories tall and very spacious, quiet, and reliable. I like going there to study, by myself or with other colleagues, use the computers, find books or articles for research, find inspirations for certain assignments, and relax. Plus, the librarians and IT technicians are reliable as well."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors at CSU are very supportive in making sure everyone passes their class with a high score as possible. They are passionate in what they do, and are very willing to help their students. All the professors I had are extremely nice and will take the time to listen to any complaints or concerns you have, whether it's during their office hours or not."

College Junior,5,Everyone likes to work together.  Staff is always encouraging and willing to give students a chance.

There are vending machines everywhere. There is a nice buffet, a cafeteria, and 'secret' candy stores that offer cheap prices. "

College Freshman,5,"CSU Women: hardworking, outgoing, helpful, and nice! Go cougars! I would say we need more guys in school. We need the men equivalent to us. "

College Freshman,5,"I like the school. I manage my time pretty well, due to the classes I can take. People are nice, they make it easy for even the shy people to approach. The education is great! The professors are challenging, yet very understanding. they care enough to ensure that the students understand the material. My favorite part: Vending machines everywhere! "
College Freshman,5,"The gym is very nice. I like to go in there and work it! There is also a smaller gym for those who like to workout in a move private environment. There is also a pool, and a room for instructional workout sessions. A whole class of workout buddies! "
College Freshman,5,"like is said, there are a lot of events and places to hangout. There is always someone there to talk to. The library is awesome, it is a whole building. Nice and quiet for a great study session.  "
College Freshman,5,"There are plenty of parties going on. On campus there are a minimum of 3 a week and it could be less or more depending on who you know. Off campus, there's tons of action to get into. "

College Freshman,5,The university is minutes away from downtown.  There are restaurants in the immediate area as well as a gas station and a Walgreens.  There is plenty of public transportation on and around the campus.
College Freshman,5,"The diversity is excellent.  There are people from most races, religions, and economic backgrounds on campus.  People that I may not have conversed with in other settings are the very people I am closest to."
College Freshman,5,"The parking is good.  I can always find a space in the lot that I need to park in.  The prices for parking are fair, they are actually much cheaper than other campuses."
College Senior,5,I drive to school all the time and the campus does re-inburst the stuents for parking passes that are expensive.
College Junior,5,I drive to school but I know that there are trains very close and lots of buses that run in that area
Junior,4,I just finished off my first semester here and I could really tell the staff and professors here really care about the students goals. I am planning to take my second semester soon and can't wait to find out what else CSU has in store for us students.
Junior,4,"My experience at Chicago State University, has been good. The professors and advisors are great. The school have small class sizes."
Freshman,4,"I will be attending the school in the fall, so I’m not sure how it is yet but the open house was very welcoming."
Sophomore,4,"The people on campus are very friendly and always willing to help. The food isn’t the best but you won’t starve. If you commute to school, the roads are a bit rough and bumpy but you’ll make it. The bus drops you off right in the front of the campus"
Junior,4,"I enjoyed attending Chicago State University.  The professors are very helpful, they are always ready to assist you if you don't understand the material."
Senior,4,Very good professors. Small Classes. Nice building and good food at cafeteria. Small classes. Professors are compassionate and understanding.

Sophomore,4,"Excellent school for knowledge and its affordable tuition makes this the best university,  faculty, and Professors are tops in their field and have the real world experience that is needed for a fast pace ever-changing economy."
Junior,4,Chicago State univeristy is the type of college where one can experience true independence and meeting different type of students. It is a very simple college where can get all their coursework in a period of time and graduate with accomplishment with our hard working professors. I would like to see in the future more activities for all students freshman to senior can get along and have fun.
Senior,4,"I love my professors and the clubs that I'm apart of. The professors really care about the students and their progress in their school career. The clubs are a great way to meet new different types of people as well. However, the administration needs works. They are rude and need training on customer service."
Senior,4,"Great school with very helpful staff. Not always on the ball about things, and certain departments need updating."
Senior,4,"I found the professors at Chicago State University to be invested in student achievement. They make themselves available if you need help or guidance. If I could change anything it would be the funding the school receives. More funding would mean better upkeep of the campus, more activities for the younger students."
Senior,4,"I am a current student at Chicago State University. In 2013, I took a break  due to some personal issues and I was welcomed back this semester(Jan '17).  I have had no issues with reinstatement. My discrepancy is that college tuition and other costs associated with attending college are even higher now than they were before I took my break.  Overall, the school has great instructors and really want the students to succeed."
Freshman,4,Nice Teachers. Boring Campus. But you learn a lot academic wise. Very friendly people. There is plenty of resources for people if you are need in help. This is a good school to go to if u want to get the job done.
College Junior,4,The school really prides itself on keeping the students safe.
College Freshman,4,Our school has part of the sheriffs department working with the University at all times to help keep the school safe.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics at the school are looked at greatly especially the baseball, basketball and football teams. They are all pretty high ranked sports for the school and help bring the school a lot of its funds. This is why no one is usually turned away fro trying out for a sports team. Also the facilities that the sports are played in are phenomenal. Every facility meets the needs of whatever sport it is meant for and some.  School is just beginning to start so there aren't many things being posted about sports but many of the people on the campus talk about them and how great they are."
College Freshman,4,"I thought that the professors were great. I had African American professors, it was interesting to hear their point of views about what is going on in our society. The professor pushed each student to reach ones full potential. The professor's were very knowledgeable about their subjects."
College Student,4,It's an early college high school which means we earn college hours while earing high school hours as well
College Senior,4,Its a great school thats relatively easy to manuever around as well as pass classes. The instructors are amazing and care about each student's success.
College Student,4,There are always a ton of police officers available on campus 24/7
College Senior,4,I don't know anyone at school that are on drugs.
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Chicago state are great. Many students are involved in sports at the school. The students have extreme school spirit for each of the sports teams. Also, the performance of every team improves very sufficiently."

College Junior,4,My professors are exceptional they help us whenever it is needed.
College Junior,4,They help out in the communities and give back.
College Sophomore,4,My school is full of spirit. It's not a day that goes by that I'm not happy excited or even ready to go to school. From my teachers always communication and being helpful. To even my fellow classmates are always ready to help out. No matter what or when it's always a love and live feel at school. From school spirit to even some event going on at school. My campus is the definition of what a perfect college life is about. I love everyday of it
College Sophomore,4,Because it is a better school for me plus they have lot scholarship to  offer for New  freshmen kids and i love the campus and and they are very friendly in social life
College Freshman,4,"The reason the school is strict in those areas because they want students to be safe. If everything is going well, the police is good to work with."
College Freshman,4,"At my school, being one of like five black freshman pursuing either Physical or Occupational Therapy makes you stand out amoungst those in the administration. There are people here with many connections that I know I will be able to utilize so that's good for me."
College Senior,4,They have very resonable and understandable rules for the most part. Only bad thing is that we camn't have overnight visitors of the opposite sex or on the night we have a campus party as of now (it might change in the near future).
College Senior,4,That I know of there is no special greek house for them but I can same they do for the school and community and are very close-knit. They do have friends and social lives outside the group (from what it looks like) and seeing and experiencing their atmospere has definitely made me wanna join one even more!
Recent Alumnus,4,i love the people here
Recent Alumnus,4,str\ay focused on what you wont to do
Recent Alumnus,4,"it helps me stay focused , excting"
Recent Alumnus,4,i love it im just tryin to finish school
Recent Alumnus,4,"Chicago State is mostly full of African Americans, but there are some whites, Muslims, Hispanics, and Asians too. I feel very comfortable in this environment and everyone treats each other as equals, despite their color, background, religion, or status. Diversity is very accepted in this university."
Recent Alumnus,4,The parties are always fun to attend to.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The scenery is very spacious and clean. They always make sure the campus is clean and the grass and trees are trimmed. The events that they have are always related to black culture, which I find very useful and educational. Also, the local attitude towards students is very welcoming. Everyone, (teachers, staff, graduates, and students) always greet each other along the way, even if they do not know each other. I find that very hospitable."
Recent Alumnus,4,GREEK LIFE IS PRETTY BIG ON CAMPUS. THERE IS NO GREEK HOUSING BECAUSE CAMPUS IS PRETTY SMALL.
Recent Alumnus,4,"THINGS HAPPEN EVERYWHERE, BUT SAFETY IS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. IF AN ISSUE DOES OCCUR A MASS EMAIL IS SENT OUT AND CAMPUS POLICE ARE VERY NOTICEABLE ON CAMPUS. THERE HAS BEEN VERY FEW TIMES WHERE I HAVE NOT FELT SAFE ON CAMPUS BE IT ONE IN THE AFTERNOON OR ONE IN THE MORNING."
College Sophomore,4,We always have police surounding the school
College Junior,4,The availability of computers on campus are great. There are computer in the library and computer labs in the buildings. The internet connection is generally good and accessible anywhere on campus.
College Junior,4,From the time I entered the university i have not seen students participate in during drugs or alcohol on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The City of Chicago has multiple attractions and they are easily accessible via public transportation. The Magnificent Mile has plenty of great stores, there are museums, Navy Pier, fine restaurants, Garrett's popcorn, and much more"
College Sophomore,4,I believe the teachers are invested in you learning and being productive.  If the student is successful then it looks good for the faculty and university.
College Sophomore,4,Most students I've met seem to be focused on their studies.
College Sophomore,4,Public transportation is close by the schools and runs every half-hour all night
College Senior,4,"The atmosphere is great, I commute to school and the local community is always involved."
College Sophomore,4,The program gets one prepared through internships moving to the start of a successful career.
College Sophomore,4,I plan to intern to find out what job I like.
College Junior,4,Campus police are always around. Strict drug free campus.
College Junior,4,There are always patrol cars driving around and they respond quickly.
College Junior,4,Everyone is included and the parties are a blast to go to.
College Junior,4,You have to take the opportunity whenever possible.
College Sophomore,4,GREAT EXPERIENCE AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT
College Freshman,4,"Fear no more of not being connected to the internet. there is always a computer to use. For Netflix, Facebook or games It would be best for you to have your own, because it would not look nice if you are checking up on your man's wall, while someone else is trying to find a computer for some work. "
College Freshman,4,I haven't seen any one drink/inhale/inject anything. I don't think people really use drugs on campus. 
College Freshman,4,"It is a good school. The staff, students and professors are all a family. Everyone is friendly and willing to help. We have an impressive basketball team that puts up a good game. There is always something to do or participate in. "
College Freshman,4,"It's your choice. Drugs is not presently shown around campus, as said before it all depends on who you know."
Senior,2,The online classes was a horrible experience. The instructor was not ready or prepared for the online experience and everything was rushed and unorganized. The school did a horrible job of accommodating the students with tuition and resources. I feel the school is more concerned about about getting new enrollment than have a great graduation number
Sophomore,2,This school is not good at all theirs no school spirt . There’s no staff to help freshmens transition into college . The advisors don’t help you with the classese you should be taking and student don’t graduate on time . The school isn’t kept clean classerooms are dirty and bathrooms. Professors do the  Bear minimum with helping student understand the  material in class. This school needs to close down or improve .
College Junior,2,I'm grateful that they accepted me but I feel like you are at a handicap graduating from here.
College Junior,2,I would give a lower rating but I had one decent semester while in the dorms.
College Junior,2,I would honestly say that the school spirit is very lackluster.
College Junior,2,I applied to this university as a last minute resort of my college choices.
College Sophomore,2,"In some departments there are many opportunities for jobs and internships such as media production and some education majors find help in their departments, but it all depends on who you have as professors through your four years."
College Sophomore,2,"I am a student athlete, it is a second year program. We have only 2 athletic trainers for the entire athletic department. Many of the teams have losing records and none are very successful. Rarely any fans come and support the sports team. The track and soccer team have to play on off campus sites because there is not a soccer field and the track is not regulation size. The soccer team has to practice in the outfield of the baseball field, sometimes during baseball's practice time. The athletic advisors show no support for the sports teams unless the coaches are donating money to the school annually. The athletic advisors also have no faith in the teams, and rarely acknowledge the fact that they are on campus. Our weight room and training room are in the same room in the building and there isn't enough room to go around for everyone. The soccer and baseball teams are forced to split into groups when they workout based on the fact that there aren't enough weights or machines for the teams to use as a whole. The locker rooms are not up to par. The basketball teams have luxury locker rooms, while baseball and soccer have to give theirs away during basketball season and are not allowed in there and cannot keep any personal belongings inside. The baseball and soccer teams barely have enough room in their locker rooms for all of the players to fit comfortably. Some players have to put their lockers in the hallways due to lack of space."
College Sophomore,2,"The schools location is not the best, the administrators are very unorganized and do not know about their field of expertise. The academic advisors do not know about their assigned majors and advise students to take the wrong courses and only blame the students and not themselves for the mistake."
College Junior,2,I believe that I was advised wrong by choosing the classes I had when I first came to Chicago State.
College Junior,2,Do not live on campus.
College Junior,2,"This is my second semester here, and It has been terrible."
College Senior,2,"Professors let the class teach each other. Professors get away with talking to students any type of way. Going to higher ups is usually a waste of time.

A couple of courses were hard because of the professors. One course I was in started off with 20 students and ended with 4 students. No one understood the professor, and when you asked her a question, she got confused. Most of us dropped, others took a chance and ended up with low grades.

The professors in a couple of courses I had hated for students to ask questions or asked them to explain in more depth. 

Another professor called us dumb."
College Senior,2,"When doing my externship, I'd overheard a few people state that they hate dealing with Chicago State University."
College Senior,2,I wouldn't choose the school again because its's disorganized and confusing.
College Senior,2,"If I could do it all over again, I am not sure I would choose to attend this particular institution. It is difficult to reach personnel via telephone. No one seems to have any valid information for the students and they send the students from building to building with invalid information. When changes occur, the student body are not notified and have to find other means of discovering the information. When student fees were implemented and increased more and more, students were not notified and the fees are applied AFTER financial aid is awarded, which leaves the students to pay nearly $3,000 out of pocket per semester."
College Junior,2,The options are poor and the meals are high
Recent Alumnus,2,I do not like the party scene in Chicago.
College Freshman,2,This university is in the middle of the city. Its not much of a college town like most universities. It needs more places that appeal to the average college student.
College Freshman,2,"The immediate neighborhood is nothing to really tell your friends about, unless you feel like bashing a neighborhood. Its when you're traveling towards downtown or going towards the north side of Chicago that things really start to pick up."
Recent Alumnus,2,we dont have a sports team yet!!
Recent Alumnus,2,KEEP UP WITH ALL OF YOUR PAPERWORK. DO NOT LOSE ONE COPY OF ANYTHING. STAY METICULOUSLY ORGANIZED. THE PEOPLE IN THE FINANCIAL AID DEPT SEEM TO FORGET THAT THEIR JOB IS TO HELP YOU GET SCHOOL PAID FOR SO THEY MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A JOB.
Recent Alumnus,2,FOR AN OUT OF STATE COLLEGE STUDENT CSU IS NOT ACCOMODATING IF YOUR WISH IS TO LIVE OFF CAMPUS. ANYWHERE DECENT IS TOO FAR AND COSTS TOO MUCH.
College Sophomore,2,not to many discounts offered at local stores
College Junior,2,I have never eaten at the cafeteria on campus. The food served does not look appetizing. I would rather not eat.
College Sophomore,2,The living arrangements surrounding the school consists of houses and do not have many apartments available to rent
College Sophomore,2,you have to pay for printing
College Sophomore,2,It do not affect my campus experience
College Sophomore,2,Most students live in the city so it's not a big deal.
College Junior,2,I eat at home or on campus. Not much choice or variety. I like to eat healthy or not at all.
College Senior,2,"I cannot really contribute to this area, given the fact that I do not go to clubs. I do not know about any of the clubs near or around the campus, if any."
College Senior,2,"Not convenient, or cost effective"
College Freshman,2,Some students smoke weed or drink but its not an everyday thing...barely noticable
College Senior,2,I love my interactions with the school itself but they do not seem to assist you in all of the offices.
College Sophomore,2,Not enough spots and the price for parking is outrageous
College Sophomore,2,Its a god school butits too many disturbances and it not that organized.
College Sophomore,2,"Its good and they have chefs prepare it, I usually dont eat it."
College Sophomore,2,They have lots of computers but some of them dont work or are slow.
College Sophomore,2,"I only took one class and the graduate level science program is hard period, but I know I worked hard for my grade and understand the concept. I'm just not a good test taker, but plan on doing better in order to succeed in this program."
College Junior,2,The cost of books are ridiculous. Everyone should be provide with a meal plan.
College Senior,2,The school needs to be more organized in regards to financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,"Well, we are in Chicago so the weather tends to be extremely cold most of the year or extremely hot in the summer."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not a lot of options that you can choose from. There is a couple of fast food places near, but if you want a good meal you are going to have to drive like 15 to 20 minutes away from campus."
College Junior,2,"Chicago State is equipped with great computer systems, many labs have been completely replaced with apple products. Not to mention the ipad program that distributed ipad's to students for the use of academic purposes. However, the internet system is a very difficult one to manage. There has been a transition in administration and there is an undergoing process of adjusting the internet program that has caused so many failures and complete internet shut downs in several building."
College Junior,2,"Because the dining on the campus is provided by a separate entity so the institution does not control the meals served and or its quality. The quality of the meals served is moderate/ it has its goods and it has its bad. It is personally not one of the best, however the University in previous administration placed a contract that hasn't expired. Until the contract expires we shall remain functioning with the same entity."
College Freshman,2,"We are still in Chicago with very good attractions, but Chicago State university is not located in a very safe neighborhood"
College Junior,2,"As a commuter, meaning that I do not live in the campus, I hardly hear any talk about the Greek Life.  I see the posters on the bulletin boards but they provide little information.  After being there for 3 semesters in the Education Program,  I actually just had classes with a few members of a frat and it still did not seem that they put their frats out there for people to want to join them."
College Junior,2,"My experience with the financial aid process was a bit of a struggle, but as long as you submit everything early their should be no problems. If you are a last minute person then there is a great possibility that you will have difficulty receiving finical aid."
College Junior,2,"There is no night life on campus, but there is plenty to do in downtown Chicago."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm in grad school, so I'm not really a part of it."
College Junior,2,I personally think that parking cost way to much at CSU.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Park Early – If you want to get somewhere close to class, get there early. Take early morning classes to get the best spots."
College Junior,2,The computers are slow at times and I don't like the fact that you have to pay 10 cent per page when I'm paying college tution. One thing I do like is the fact I can stay on the computer as long as I want or until closing. I would prefer to go to my school library than the public one because they time you.
College Senior,2,"The computer lad/library at Chicago Statae University is crowded but you can always fine a seat or a place to work. It's the network at CSU that'sthe problem, it's always hard to log-in for wifi and on the the actual network. At times it's very frustrating if we as students need to go on moodle to do classwork or homework assignments"
College Junior,2,Worst Admissions Proccess Ever – I would like to say this has to be the worst admission proccess ever. The staff acts only when your appear to be upset and and attmept to speak to higer management. I dont see how they are still open with the lack of care they take guarding students files and information. Each week its somthing new some new policy some new way they find to lose your informantion. I just want people to know and to really think twice about your choices in schools.
College Junior,2,School Experiences – My overall experience has been fare. There are possitives and negatives about the education at chicago state university. There is a diverse population of students. Howerver not all the students spend time on campus after class so encounters are limited. Being an lgbt student I do not feel the campus is very open and accepting. If I could do it all over again I would not choose chicago state.
Recent Alumnus,2,Not Very Diverse – There are not that many different ethinicities at Chicago State. I have only seen African American students and a few Latino students.
College Sophomore,2,"Records and Bursar – Where do I begin? When you want to get into the University, everything is fine. However when you decide that you want to have some paperwork forwarded or take classes at another University, you are in for a world of trouble. I have talked to personnel hours on end without getting anywhere. Then finally at the end of the week, my problem was resolved and I could apply for the class I needed. Also, on a side note, the cafeteria was closed for 3 days straight. This forced students to travel off campus for meals. If there is anything to do with guidelines and deadlines, make sure you find it out for yourself. Follow this or you will definitely be in a pickle."
College Senior,2,"Few Healthy Choices – Although there are a number of dining options around campus, from wendy's and popeyes, burger king and 2 kfc one on 103 and one on 95th churches, mcdonalds and side gyro shops, there are few if any choices to for vegans or people that are more orientated toward healthy eating."
College Sophomore,2,Very Annoying Process – You have to stay on them about every little thing or you will be sorry.
Freshman,1,"Wow, what a God awful, unresponsive, irresponsible group of employees.  If I could give no starts I would.  Responsiveness when dealing with registration issues was abysmal. No one new how to help nor did they get back to my emails and calls.  Identified some issues a couple of weeks before the semester started and got into a week after classes started and couldn't get the advisor to respond.  Had to email the dean and all the staff in between on the last email, and one week later, still no response.  Was forced to register late at another university... wow is all I can say to this unprofessional, disorganized and terrible university.  Avoid this school, there are other schools in Chicago that are equally as cheap, except they actually help you and respond to your issues."
Freshman,1,"I attended Chicago State for one year.  The funding for extra curricular was limited and very low.  I joined a cheer leading team, went to practices faithfully only to be told my dedication was a waste of time because the time was cut before the first basketball game.  The education is not good.  Many courses seemed too easy, I did not learn much and felt like my high school was more challenging.  The school is also not located in a nice area and does not seem very safe.  The dorms are small and the cafeteria does not offer much and is not open for long.  I would not recommend going here."
College Senior,1,"I have had problems with teachers in the Health Sciences program and nothing is ever done. I have gone to the Dean of Students, Dean of the Department, and the Dean of the School. Nothing. Teachers are allowed to get away with things and nothing is done. The student is always the victim."
College Junior,1,hard to find internship opportunities and no scholarship fir Communication students such as myself
College Junior,1,The cost is ridiculous and many places don't deliver because of the terrible parking situation and cost. Also there are NO student discountss
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not many quality, affordable choices"
Recent Alumnus,1,Nothing to eat around campus except a blend of onion burgers and cheetos.
Recent Alumnus,1,It is not enough Finacial Aid to cover the cost of tuition and expenses.
Recent Alumnus,1,No vegan options. Nothing organic. Nothing GMO-free
College Freshman,1,There isn't much of an off campus variety. There are not many resources available for students who need help with finding off campus housing.
College Freshman,1,My school hardly has any money to give out to the students. I'd say it is greatly underfunded and could use some serious help in that aspect.
College Sophomore,1,Registration is always bad and unorganized.
College Senior,1,The winter weather is the worst and it makes it difficult to get to school. The school never closes on the worst days even when the temperature is 20 below zero.
College Junior,1,we need better parking space
College Senior,1,Horrible area to live in or be in. Crime rate is high.
College Senior,1,Pretty much only the library has computer in them. Others building may have some but they are not offered to students.
College Junior,1,"Near Chicago State, one can hardly find something that is not fried chicken, fish, or ribs."
College Junior,1,There is nowhere to go in walking distance and the area has unhealthy food choices. The nearest restaurant is McDonalds.
College Junior,1,"There is only parking near resident areas near the campus, but requires a walking distance, but it is the only way to get free parking. Students could also get a school semester parking pass so they can park on campus, but it requires a fee."
College Sophomore,1,The off campus dining is limited to two chains and independent/unhealthy fast food
College Junior,1,"Unless you have a car the nightlife around the school does not exist.    Students would have to take public transportation, and their safety would definitely be at risk."
College Junior,1,"I currently use public transportation and must say I really do need a car because I live farther away from Chicago State University than some. We have a lot of parking, but many students so good parking gets scarce at times. Many end up having to find a parking spot somewhere on a street close to the school, hoping they will not get a ticket or fine. Parking isn't as close to class buildings as they should be, but greater space availability for parking is something that is greatly desired.  As far as permit costs, I believe the cost for a permit at Chicago State University is absolutely ridiculous! A parking permit is about $310. I believe that many permits are expensive at many colleges. I believe that students who attend the school shouldn't have to pay such a large permit for parking especially when the students at Chicago State University must pay a mandatory fee of $113 for the Upass from CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) that is included in our tuition. The Upass is a bus card that allows students to use the CTA buses and trains while going to and from school. That's fine, but the bad part is that those who already have cars and drive to school, who do not need the Upass must pay that mandatory $113 fee! Then, they must turn around and pay an extra $310 for a parking permit. That is very unfair, and I believe Chicago State University is definitely over charging for things. This needs to change immediately!"
College Sophomore,1,The food offered is very low quality and extremely expensive. A water bottle can cost $2.50 or more and there is no variety of options for food.
College Junior,1,"As an education major with excellent grades and an outstanding GPA I was very surprise to see little to no help with internships, scholarships or job opportunities :("
College Junior,1,There is absolutely not enough parking on campus and it is too expensive.
College Freshman,1,the computers labs kinda suck we have to pay for printing sometimes the computers don't work certain ones don't even print i mean we're college students we barely have money what happens when papers are due and we don't have the money to print are we out of luck and on top of that they say its ten cent to print but the machine to load the card doesn't even expect change
College Freshman,1,The greek life at CSU is not very open. I never see bulletins or emails about them.
College Junior,1,they is none at all. unless you leave the school and travel for some distance by both train and bus.
College Junior,1,Too much old people go to school here. they drag the vibe down and make it depressing. The people that come here look and dress like they got no ambition.
College Junior,1,"Extreme bland boring, no places to officially eat for miles, no convenience stores, shops nothing. Far away from downtown and the city life. Feels like a prison more times. Lacks diversity of cultures and people."
College Sophomore,1,"There are a lot of potholes, and there aren't many spots available."
College Junior,1,"i WISH THE DORMS DIDN'T COST SO MUCH FOR THE STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT ON A SPORT TEAM OF ANY KIND AND THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE THOSE CHANGES ON THE DORMS, THEN RAISE THE PRICES."
College Junior,1,"Computer Access – Ther is a limited number of computers and study space. There is only one building with printing. We must pay for all our prints. The internet is usually down so it is wise to get a computer, printer, and internet service before classes begin"
College Junior,1,Though there is a not drug or alcohol policy on campus stdents ave easy access to drugs and drinks. There isn't much peer pressure and it is not very visible
Recent Alumnus,1,Poor Service – I rated the financial aid process with a D because no one in the financial aid office knows anything. If you ask a question their response is I don't know. They never say I'm not sure about that let me check and see. I was very frustrated my first semester trying to get money for my books.
College Sophomore,1,"Sports Are a Joke – We don't have a sufficient AD that can allow us to hire quality coaches, nor do we have a support system at the instituion."
College Junior,1,On Campus Living – Living on campus is an okay experience at chicago state. I had a girl RA and she was annoying and too strict. Girls should not RA boys dorms. The rooms were way too small. They need to build new dorms.
College Junior,1,there is no off campus housing at chicago state university
College Freshman,1,"There are alot of stores, ofetn times the student go down town for lunch or to hang out.Students also participate in workouts and study groups with students from surrounding university. But having a school on the souhtside of Chicago is bad because its dangerous with gang violence and the gun violence doesn't make any sense how many innocent peole get shot."
College Junior,1,"The Greek life at CSU is a joke for the undergraduate population. CSU does have the traditional campus life that every undergraduate student expects. There isn't any on-campus or close-to-campus for students, who are interested in the fraternity or sorority experience. All students involved in a fraternity or sorority lives off-campus, or with their parents."

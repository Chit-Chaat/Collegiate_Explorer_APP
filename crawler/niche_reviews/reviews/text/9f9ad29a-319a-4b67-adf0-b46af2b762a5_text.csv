Freshman,5,"Drew University is a very involved school. Not just with their academics but with their clubs, organizations, and other programs. They involve there students as much as staff, even when deciding on big topics. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming as well."
Freshman,5,I’ve only seen the campus I haven’t started classes yet but it is amazing the nature is just calming I love everything about the environment around and inside the school.
Freshman,5,I did not take courses online. I did and currently still doing many orientation Courses and it is amazing they save it so I have 2 whole months to catch up. They are tech savvy.
Freshman,5,Drew University is a close knit community where it was home away from home for me.  I also felt really comfortable with the Soccer coaches and the welcoming that the team offered as I will also be playing for their mens soccer team.
Freshman,5,"I actually have not yet taken any online courses yet with Drew, however we will be starting out our Fall 2020 year online and I feel confident that they will give us guidance and the necessary tools to start the year off on the right foot!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Drew. I have made great friends, had a lot of really good classes taught by really knowledgeable professors, am on a sports team with a fantastic coach. I have gotten everything I could've asked for in a college experience so far."
Sophomore,5,"The school worked with everybody to make sure they were not overly stressed or overworked. Every professor made sure that learning was the priority, and that success would come as long as you did as much as you could do."
Works Here,5,"Have worked at Drew U for over 5 years and I can't imagine being anywhere else.  Wish I had found this position a lot earlier in my career.  Drew U is one of the most warm and welcoming places to work and be.....students, faculty, staff and alumni together create a generous and innovative college community."
Freshman,5,"I love Drew university small but safe enviourment. Because Drew University is a private school there more opportunity for you to shine or get the correctional help that you need. instead of being just a number, you are actually a person."
Freshman,5,In high school I felt lost on what I wanted to do in life. I just needed guidance. At Drew I have the space and help to find out what I want. It’s filled with amazing people that will be your friend. It’s been a terrific experience at Drew.
Senior,5,"Drew is an excellent school when it comes to opportunities on campus. It has a really active student life office, with club events nearly every night, and most students involved in multiple events and organizations on campus. It's really easy to start a club, be on the board of a club, or get a job on campus."
Junior,5,Drew has not only provided me with the fundamental foundation of what a real college experience should be it has time and time again taught me countless transferable skills that I feel confident in taking with me into the real world after I graduate.
Freshman,5,"I was really impressed by Drew. There is a lot of focus on the Launch program, which is how the school helps launch students into a career after college. They want to make sure you're ready for the real world. It feels more grown up than other schools I toured where they spent most of the time talking about food and ""pajama party Fridays"". But it's also still a small liberal arts school that focuses on learning in a lot of different areas. They have small classes so you can work closely with the professors. I recommend going to a Drew Discovery Day so you can meet some professors and students. The campus feels like you're far away from the New York city, but it's an hour away."
Alum,5,"Drew University is a great undergraduate school if you are looking for small classes and accessible professors. My academic experience at Drew was exceptional. I loved my classes and got to know my professors very well. Because it is a small school, the social scene can feel limiting, similar to high school, but if you find a group of friends you really enjoy then it's great. 
Madison is not a great scene for college-age students, however, the campus itself is beautiful and it's easy to take a train to NYC or uber to Morristown if you're looking for more fun."
Junior,5,"The campus is beautiful and not too big so you wont get lost easily. Most places on campus are easily avaiable and open until around 2am. The classes require a lot of attention and study but the professors are definitley there to help. Social life is to be expected, pretty much everyone knows everyone."
Niche User,5,"I personally enjoyed Drew University very much! I had wonderful experiences there, and everyone on the campus was incredibly friendly! Overall student life there is very good. Although I am not involved in the athletics there, I have friends who are, and they have nothing bad to say. As far as food goes, they have many options, even for those with dietary restrictions."
Junior,5,"There are so many things that make Drew University stand out. From the location and convenience to academic opportunities in New York City, to their amazing study abroad experiences. Drew’s very great teaching staff has added towards my learning experience and has exponentially furthered my knowledge in the field I am pursuing. It’s a choice I’m proud I made!"
Niche User,5,"I like the positive environment. Everyone wants to see you succeed, and offers to help you achieve your goals."
Junior,5,"Drew is very good academically with small classes, helpful professors, and free tutoring available. Has been improving the  student experience and feel of community this past year. Food isnt the best though"
Senior,5,Drew has been a great decision for me so far. I am a current senior and have loved my experience on campus. The classes are small in size and the professors care a lot about your individual learning and experiences. The school is entirely what you make of it--there are opportunities for people to be superstars and lots of amazing mentors to help out along the way. It has been the perfect home away from home for me.
Sophomore,5,"As a first generation commuter student, I found Drew to be the perfect option for me. Since the first open house I attended, I knew that this was the school for me. A small school is exactly what I wanted as I found it to be very easy to build close professional relationships with your professors who are very helpful."
Freshman,5,"Great school with that home atmosphere. 
The class sizes are small and the  staff is Great with pleasant attitudes."
Freshman,5,"My dream school is Drew. I love the academics, the community, the professors, and the town of Madison. Drew feels like home."
Alum,5,"This school changed my life in so many ways.  I had great professors, met great people who I am still in contact with and overall think back on my Drew days fondly.  I had a graduate school experience at a larger state school after Drew and it was no where near what Drew was to me.  If you are on the fence about going to a small school (I was at age 18), I immediately knew I made the right choice after less than a week here.  The History department (at least back then) was excellent and I really liked the small classes.  You will not get that at large schools, but ultimately it was the people I met there who made the experience such a positive one."
Niche User,5,I love Drew University!  It is a small school and is beautiful!  I have met their soccer team and really love them and the coach is great!
Freshman,5,"One of the best features that Drew has to offer is its small student to faculty ratio and the bond you form with your professors is something that's a rarity these days. As far as campus life goes, there's a sense of community which is very welcoming, especially to those living away from home for the first time."
Freshman,5,"The staff explained everything very well. The student tour guide was well informed, professional and friendly. The campus is small and cozy."
Junior,5,"its an amazing school, where everybody knows everyone. It has a wonderful campus full of vegetation and lots of paths to walk and just hang out."
Alum,5,"Drew is an excellent college. I enjoyed spending four years at Drew. I can't speak for anyone else, but my experience there was memorable, challenging and life enhancing. I recommend Drew for studious applicants who are looking for a small intimate setting to spend four years."
Senior,5,Drew University is what you make of it. There are plenty of academic and professional opportunities here but you need to take advantage of them as soon as you get on campus and not wait until later. Drew has great professors and the academics are good. The campus is beautiful and it's very serene. It's often quiet on the weekends but with a great group of friends then you should be fine.
Senior,5,"Drew is a great university with a lot of opportunities for graduate school and jobs, however, you need to take advantage of them early on and not wait until last minute. Drew is quiet and serene, which is good but at times it can be too quiet. It can be very fun with a great group of friends at your side. Drew University is what you make of it, if you want it to be a great experience, get involved and simple take advantage of all academic and professional opportunities early on."
Niche User,5,"An exceptional university on the rise, with dedicated professors, a progressive, intelligent and effective  administration and top notch facilities."
Sophomore,5,"Words cannot describe what this school has done for me. I have read many reviews that seem to give it a bad rap simply because of it's size. YES it is quiet on the quad sometimes, as only about 1,500 undergrads attend the school. YES it would be lovely to pass a new stranger every few steps on a beautiful, sunny day while walking down the path. However, when it's rainy and life isn't easy and every single fellow Drew student you walk by offers you their umbrella and engages you in small talk about that professor that you all know, you will realize that coming to the forest was the best decision you have ever made. 1,500 of the finest people you'll ever meet."
Freshman,5,"I love the rolling green lawns, and the campus in general. The professors strive to see you succeed, and hope the very best for you!"
Alum,5,"Drew University is an AMAZING school that had provided me with a very strong academic education, solid business connections but most importantly, life long friendships which, as those who may be a little older, are what really matter in life.  I left Drew, went on to an Ivy grad school and  currently do very well in business.  The relationships and memories made at Drew are priceless. Drew provided a solid foundation for life.  I think Drew is a hidden gem in the national ranks."
Niche User,5,Such a welcoming environment. Everyone is so friendly and caring. Loved the campus. In a nice safe are where there are plenty of things to do on the weekend. NYC is 45 minutes away so its a good place to attend school.
Alum,5,"Drew University is a great place in a perfect location. Madison, NJ is such a nice, safe town that is great to relocate to after graduating. You also have the luxury of going into NYC as a student or working there after graduating. The professors at Drew are one-of-a-kind. They are very passionate about what they teach and truly care about their students. At Drew you will feel a great sense of community which is important when you are in such a major life transition. Almost everyone I know who graduated from Drew is doing great in careers or graduate school because we were so well-prepared."
College Freshman,5,I was between this school and a school that gets a slightly higher rating for academic rigor. I must say that this school challenges me intellectually in a way so intense that I know I made the correct choice. Please take a step bak and forget about the ratings of colleges and how well they teach their students formulas. This school educates your soul. With each class I can feel my soul developing and stretching. I am who I am because of this institution and I know the world more and more each day because of it.
College Freshman,5,I feel extremely safe on/around campus. No companies here
College Freshman,5,Beautiful. Absolutely Beautiful. ( the housing and the people)
College Freshman,5,This school is absolutely magical. It's like a forest filled with knowledge.
College Freshman,5,The academics are top of the line!
College Freshman,5,"Drug use is not tolerated on campus. The only thing people smoke openly is cigarettes, and no smoking is allowed in the dorms."
College Freshman,5,"Campus security truly cares about the students, and are more than willing to help. One time, I found a lost keychain (with all the keys on it!) and I went straightaway to Campus Security. They took care of everything very quickly, and the person got their keys back. They are well-informed and actively tell students when something is wrong, like an e-mail scam."
College Freshman,5,"My experience, class-wise, is very good. The professors answer many questions, and encourage one to do their best. They are very in-tune and knowledgeable about what they do."
College Freshman,5,"Housing at Drew is pretty good- I admit, there aren't air conditioners, but the heaters work hard in the winter. The rooms are a little less spacious, but there's plenty of room to maneuver."
College Freshman,5,I feel extremely safe on campus. But at night time there are deers.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing. One on one help. Tutoring is included and encouraged. Amazing people, small classes, beautiful campus. Sure the food is not great (what college would have amazing food?) and there are some people who suck but you'd find that everywhere. It's a melting pot of people who just end up getting along perfectly."
College Freshman,5,I got what i needed.
College Freshman,5,"Madison is beautiful, cute and safe"
College Freshman,5,Madison Options and Location to school
College Senior,5,"Incredible professors, 90% of whom holding the highest degree available in their respective fields."
College Freshman,5,I'm a double major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Spanish. The opportunities and enrichment offered in both majors are amazing. The research opportunities are endless in the sciences which is allowed by Drew's unique RISE program and DSSI program.
College Freshman,5,Drew has an excellent faculty and academic rigor. The undergraduate school has equipment and opportunities that some graduate schools don't even have.
College Freshman,5,"Drew is very munificent when it comes to financial aid. Even though Drew is one of the most expensive institutions in the nation, the financial aid makes Drew one of the most affordable schools for all economic backgrounds."
College Freshman,5,Drew offers a great amount of financial aid. I came here because it was so affordable.
College Freshman,5,The social life here is very friendly and students dress appriopriately for classes.
College Freshman,5,Drew University is smaller than the high school I attended however it is extremely diverse. There are no problems of bullying because of religion or sexual orientation.
College Freshman,5,Classes are small and every professor I have had so far always offers office hours. They are extremely easy to get in contact with and are always willing to help us with homework or anything else we need.
College Sophomore,5,"Madison is the cutest, friendliest town in America. The locals all love to see us and they remember which schools we go to if we ever wear campus hoodies or what have you. They like to come to our games and ask us about our school work. There are a bunch of little shops right in town, as well as a stop & shop, and many restaurants.New York City is a short train ride from Madison and the train station is a ten minute walk from campus. It's a great location."
Freshman,4,"Drew is super friendly and the campus area is nice. Students and professors are always welcoming. There are a lot of resources  and people you can reach out to if you need the help. Because they are a small school, you don’t just feel like a number."
Freshman,4,The professors were very helpful and are very understanding when it came to internet difficulties. They are always willing to help when you ask them for it.
Freshman,4,Easy to navigate and find what you need and even if you are having trouble there is always someone to help.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus, it is beautiful and not too far from town.  The classes are not to big nor are they too small. The professors are always willing to help when help is needed and when professors are not available tutors are."
Sophomore,4,"During the virus taking online classes were a challenge at first however, it was easy to adopt too.  In my opinion going to class has never been easier minus wifi problems. If wifi problems did occur the professors were very understanding. There were also recorded lectures of that day that were made available."
Sophomore,4,"Shifting to online classes was completed effectively and fluidly at Drew University. Professors were ready to make the necessary adjustments and to help students with any concerns they had as quickly as possible. Exams and quizzes were more difficult because professors allowed open-note exams, which was a challenge at times. However, professors appreciate students attending class everyday and the effort students exhibit even under stressing conditions. They are understanding that for some students being at home can be a distraction. They will require you to do all the work still, but are understanding if you have a hard time learning or completing the work on time."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy attending Drew University. The faculty is one of a kind. Professors truly want to students to learn as much as they possibly can in class and out of class. Faculty members are motivated to help students gain enriching experiences that may contribute to their intended careers, including internships and on-campus jobs. The campus is very diverse and students are welcome to explore various clubs, social events, and activities offered based on what is important to them. I have been able to make friends with students of various backgrounds and beliefs, many of which who are not in the same field or major as me. The only suggestion I would make is tuition cost. Tuition cost alone is a little high and it can be difficult for students seeking to pay for college on their own. Besides the financial aspect, Drew University is a great school. I'm looking forward to attending in-person classes in the fall of 2020."
Sophomore,4,"I love the professors, my friends and athletics.  I would not trade my experience for anything.  I find my courses enlightening and challenging and the professors accessible and willing to help.  The dorms and suites are very well maintained and clean.  The town of Madison is wonderful and safe.  

I have met so many life long friends here - I could not be happier.  

I am also a student athlete and this experience is something I always dreamed of!

The Forest, as Drew is nick named, is beautiful and quiet.  I took one look and fell in love.  I would highly recommend this University to undergraduates looking for a quality educaiton and experience."
Sophomore,4,"I love all of the professors, as they are engaged in their jobs and care for their students. I wish the food were better, however, and I wish that the school was better kept."
Sophomore,4,"The community at Drew is very friendly and you form solid relationships with a lot of your peers between classes and extracurricular experiences. The professors really care about your personal achievements and they want you to succeed in every class. Drew has a variety of extracurricular activities such as sports teams and clubs. In addition, there are a lot of service opportunities for students on and off campus to stay engaged with the community."
Junior,4,As a transfer student I must honestly say my experience here has been great when it comes to academics clubs and the professors who have taught me but the only thing I could say I didn't like about this campus is the res life because I feel the faculty do not take the time to place students with people they could feel comfortable with and get along with. I went through this experience and honestly I was very disappointed how they handled my situation which resulted in me planning on commuting from my house next year.
Sophomore,4,"At Drew, the faculty and staff put us students above all and really work with us in every aspect to ensure a great 4 years! Personally, I love how close to home I am while still being able to have space if need be."
Junior,4,"Great out of school experiences (study abroad, new york semesters, etc) and great professors! They actually care about you"
Sophomore,4,"Here at Drew I have been able to express myself in all types of ways. For example, I am part of the Latinx Organization that holds events for everyone where we celebrate Latinx culture. Another way is that I am always reminded I have access to people of higher position to voice my concerns."
Alum,4,"The campus is beautiful. There were a lot of interesting and fun extracurricular activities and clubs. The classes were interesting and the professors, excellent. I enjoyed my four years at Drew U. I was an Art majority and the art facilities are incredible. Some of my best memories were at the DOYO."
Alum,4,I loved the academics and the small size. The professors really get to know you and really care. I would like to change the diversity and the support given to commuter students.
Freshman,4,Really easy to apply. Great social circles and easy to gain access to alot of resources. As an international student I found I had more than enough support.
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love this school! The professors are excellent and everyone here is very nice. As a commuter it is harder to get involved in student life here, but it is still possible to manage, especially if you have a car. The proximity to the train station is also very convenient if you are not opposed to a short 15 minute walk to and from campus."
Niche User,4,When I went in for an admissions interview I was given a very warm welcome I walked around saw that even though they were a D3 sports schools their fields and everything related to sports was very well maintained. The staff understood that I was not from around the area so they explained clearly where all rooms would be where the gym was how to get into those places and it was overall a beautiful campus filled with beautiful and care people.
Freshman,4,First year student and so far I am loving it here! It is a great smaller campus that really gives students the opportunity to get to know your professors on a personal basis. The campus isn't too tiny but small enough so you don't have to take buses everywhere.
Senior,4,"Drew University has definitely helped grow into the person I am today.  It’s tight knit environment allows us to form a close relationship with our professors and help us focus on our studies. Drew University is quick to assist you in any financial or academic issues you may be facing and have lots of resources to fall back on. However, the environment is not as diverse as one would hope."
Freshman,4,Drew University is a great school overall. It is a small community of high achievers all with the similar goal of achieving future success and helping each other.
Senior,4,"Drew University is a small liberal arts college in suburban New Jersey, about 45 minutes from New York by train. The university offers a wide range of courses, from the arts to the hard sciences. Our theater department is nationally renowned, and our math department recently received a $1,000,000 gift from an alumnus to be used to hire new faculty. Speaking of faculty, they are great. Almost every professor I have worked with at Drew has taken my needs as a student into account and has gone out of their way to help me. On the other hand, the administration could be better. As well, the food is pretty awful and tuition is exorbitant, but that doesn't take away from the unique academic experience. I have learned so much at Drew and my time here has helped me prepare for grad school and beyond in more ways than I can count. I strongly suggest every high school senior at least come take a tour of Drew!"
Freshman,4,"Drew University is an excellent small campus that welcomes everyone. The inclusion by faculty who know your name in a class and care about each students success is the best. Academics are challenging and give you great problem solving and critical thinking skills. Campus social life is excellent people are really easy to talk to. There are party's if that's your thing, but no one forces anyone to attend. The food at Drew is average campus food, there is always a wide selection, but also room for improvement especially on the weekends. Walking around campus I always feel safe and not threatened, public safety is always driving around. But if someone tried to threaten campus I don't know public safety could stop it because the only time a guard is on duty is when the main and back campus gates are closed. The guard is supposed to ask where you are going, most do, but there is one lady that doesn't care if you stop."
Junior,4,"The college is very good, it is small so there are not a lot of people but, you need a car to go to places."
Freshman,4,"I really love studying at Drew. It fits with me so well academic-wise. The professors are amazing and really passionate about their jobs, which helps me to do better in my classes.
The clubs, however, aren't as great as they could be. There doesn't seem to be many clubs that help the students to become more involved and friendly with each other."
Alum,4,"Have my career due to my on-campus job at Drew. Experienced dedicated staff and faculty, which more than made up for the lackluster student-body and campus life."
Sophomore,4,Drew is a beautiful campus.  However the surrounding town is quite small and not much to do there.  Not your typical college town.  New York is only about 45 min by train.  So far I've been very happy with my classes and teachers and like the small class sizes.  It is very expensive to go here though and they don't seem that generous with financial aid.  So I hope it will all pay off in the end.
Freshman,4,"The coursework isn't as crazy as people said it would be, but it does keep me busy, focused, and working hard. Really, the only issue is that when I don't have work, I have nothing to do."
Freshman,4,"The campus itself is gorgeous in the warm weather.  Everyone here is friendly and willing to lend a hand to those in need.  The food varies, sometimes they make something really good and others they try but it doesn't work out well"
Sophomore,4,Drew has great academics and professors. Many people form great relationships with their professors which makes the environment open to ideas and very helpful when you do not understand a subject. Although the food has been better than previous years it still needs work.
Freshman,4,"I love the teachers, they work with students one on one and always make time to help out. The students here are friendly, but are cliquey and often it is difficult to find things to do if not involved in a sport activity."
College Freshman,4,Come here if you pay a sport because you love it but also have an equally large appetite for academics.
College Senior,4,"I have always felt safe on campus. Last semester I had a class get out around 10:00pm, and I didn't feel unsafe walking from my class to my car afterwards."
College Senior,4,"You meet a lot of different and interesting people here. Your professors will try very hard to teach you about what life is going to be after you graduate. The school is SUPER expensive so I don't think the value and the education quite match up, but I am happy with the choice of the school."
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe on campus, I don't feel in danger unless I'm walking from my car to the parking lot at night.  The security however is a joke at the front gate, anyone could get in."
College Freshman,4,The professors really care about your success and future.
College Freshman,4,"Diversity on campus is highly important, and few problems arise."
College Freshman,4,"Career prospects are pretty good here, seeing many end up going into successful careers, especially international jobs."
College Freshman,4,"Drew University is a truly magnificent experience! The professors are really helpful, and its easy to get around campus. The fact that one of the researchers won a Nobel Prize certainly helps, too!"
College Freshman,4,There are club/intramural sports for those who do not wish to play varsity. And everyone loves to attend sporting events
College Junior,4,The website DrewLink is a great resource for finding internships and jobs while studying.
College Junior,4,"Professors really care about students, classes are small, and course offerings are generally diverse."
College Junior,4,"The small class sizes make it incredibly easy to know your professors on a personal level, which allows you to get the most out of your learning experience. It's also nice to have such a small and close knit community among other students who dorm on campus."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't used the athletic facilities but they look very nice.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the resources, the professors are very professional, and the international friendships you make are incredible."
College Freshman,4,I was worried that Drew would not be racially diverse but it really is. Drew is a place where everyone fits in because it's a school full of unique people. It's like a soup that has a bit of everything in it but somehow just tastes really really good.
College Freshman,4,"The freshman dorms are fantastic. Individual bathrooms, average sized rooms, great RAs"
College Senior,4,"Fairly easy to register, huge class variety."
College Senior,4,"Helpful with internships, co-op, work study, etc."
College Senior,4,"Security personnel always around, friendly area."
College Senior,4,Most people are friendly and inviting into their groups.
Recent Alumnus,4,I never thought it was possible for a university to foster such close relationships both between faculty and students and within the student body itself. Professors want you to succeed and encourage students to take advantage of the variety of tutoring options available for students.
College Senior,4,So many options available. There is more than something for everyone.
College Senior,4,All faculty and staff members are very easily contacted.
College Senior,4,Very easy to contact the financial aid office. Drew is very willing to supply financial aid and scholarships.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many pizza places, chipotle, and restaurants near campus."
College Sophomore,4,My fin aid covered about 90% of tuition..
College Freshman,4,"Cluck U, Dominoes, Chinese Food, Sushi"
College Freshman,4,nice rooms with a good amount of space.
Freshman,2,"Do not come here unless you are really introverted or really extroverted: Drew is such a tiny school. Not only is it only 1,600 undergrads, about 10% of them are commuters and another 10% are a part of the INTO program, which is for international students that don’t speak English well. This makes Drew feel incredibly small, you will see a familiar face literally everywhere you go, and for some personality types this works well with, but I hate it. It forces introverted people to come out of there shell, and really extraverted people are happy because they get to be social 24/7. I just absolutely hated it because it felt like I’d never meet any new people and everyone knows everyone’s business. Please consider this before you come here, I really regret it.

Drew didn't work for me, but there a few types of people that like it here: people here for the great financial aid, athletes, international students, hippies/socialists. Otherwise, don't come here, there's nothing for you."
Sophomore,2,"If the academics (especially the Theater Department) were not as amazing as they are, i would have transferred. The food is slop, the dorms are terrible, the parties are lame, the clubs do nothing, and public safety is a joke. Not a fun safe place to spend your 4 years.
 Girls, be aware that this college does not take rape or sexual assault seriously. They have let multiple people who have several charges against them for rape and sexual assault slide by with little to no repercussions. They are more concerned with stopping a party with music that is too loud than sending rapists to jail. 
This school couldnt care less about the well being of the student body. 
If you plan to go to Drew, be a commuter and save yourself the over priced room+board and food plan money and your sanity. 
10/10 would not recommend."
College Junior,2,"I would not choose this school if I had another chance. It is too small, and the availability to network and actually have a real college experience is lacking."
College Junior,2,"Not many people go out and support the team at games, and when they do, it is very calm and quite. Th eteams are decent, but the games are usually boring because the spirit is nonexistent."
College Freshman,2,I play on the Women's soccer team and the facilities available are not great. The athletic trainer is not helpful and is always busy.
College Sophomore,2,I don't think there are really any off campus options.
College Sophomore,2,"Students will typically order from Chipotle or a local pizza shop, but this is about all that's offered in such a prominent, up-scale area."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't really a party scene. The minor parties that do exist are disgusting and so few people attend it's just uncomfortable.
College Sophomore,2,"To work with and communicate with the financial aid department is so incredibly difficult and frustrating. They offer no support regardless of financial need. I have a 3.97 GPA and my FAFSA indicates that my EFC is 1,543; however, they offer no additional support despite my extenuating circumstances."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is terrible, the students are generally pompous and fully of themselves, and the school cannot uphold a decent or satisfying degree of academic rigor."
College Freshman,2,Campus needs to be updated and cleaned
College Freshman,2,"They don't seem to care much about drinking, but the smell of weed along with plain view is probable cause here. If you smell, you can get a violation. Even if you personally haven't used it. If your guest smells, they ban them from campus, no questions asked. They don't really follow policy with searches, and will search your room without care. If they really don't like you, they'll confiscate your keys and search your car even if it has nothing to do with anything. They are very disrespectful with personal belongings, and I know someone personally who has had the lining of their brand new car's trunk ripped to shreds because they wanted to find something against them to ban them for. For visitation, it's a pain in the ass, because you have to be with your guests at all times, including in your dorm room, so it's best to just sneak them in. Attendance wise, it depends on the sympathy of your professor. I've had good experiences with mine, and never really had an issue for an absence or two. Parking sucks because the only place for guests to park is far from everything else on campus, and it costs $3 per night. They will tow your car if it's parked somewhere it shouldn't be without warning. They will give you tickets whenever they get the chance."
College Freshman,2,D3 school that thinks it's better than it is.
College Sophomore,2,"Gross food!!! Also, the kitchen is supposed to be open until 7. The staff starts to take food away around 6:15. Incredibly disrespectful to the students paying boat loads of cash to eat with the dining plans, who may have had class or sports until late. All dining halls (2) close by 10, and all campus convenience stores (1) by 12. It makes getting food after 10 or 12 incredibly difficult, as the town is small and everything closes as well."
College Freshman,2,"Though there is whole town square just minutes away, there is not much variety and not student discounts that I'm aware of exist. Late-night options (the time most students are seeking food) are especially lacking."
College Freshman,2,There is really nothing distinguishable about Drew.
College Freshman,2,"I'm not a huge fan, they're typical dorms. Super small and cell like. There's individual bathrooms but they get gross super quickly. The walls are super thin so if there are annoying people on your floor, your life will be miserable because you will have to listen to them all the time."
College Freshman,2,Only juniors and seniors are allowed to have cars on campus. I am not aware of the cost but I have heard that spots do fill up quickly.
College Freshman,2,snow on snow on snow. except for the summer months when its really hot and there is no air conditioning in the freshmen dorms.
College Freshman,2,"They're strict over stupid stuff, and not helpful on important stuff."
College Freshman,2,"The main dining hall, the commons, causes me and the rest of the student body pain on a daily basis. There are some good options, like stir frying yourself, sautéing your own pasta, or making a sandwich, but most of the pre-made stuff is pretty bad. The Snack Bar in the EC is pretty good, but it's more expensive than the Commons because it takes points instead of meals. Java city has great coffee and good pastries, but unless you just want to get a pre-packaged sandwich for lunch, you can't really eat there."
College Junior,2,"Over the years Drew has become pretty boring because public safety is on a rampage. Luckily, there are pubs off campus in Madison and Morristown, and it's easy to go into NYC for the night."
College Senior,2,Parking on campus costs $200 for now. The commuter parking lot is horribly too small. Doesn't have enough spaces for commuters to park and you end up having to park on the other side of campus.
College Senior,2,"'Drew' and 'diversity' are not really synonymous. Considering that tuition at Drew is very expensive, it doesn't really cater to minority groups. With that being said, most of the students receive financial aid and over the past few years, more minorities have chosen Drew."
College Freshman,2,I have to commute to school because we cannot afford housing. The commute is long and difficult during hurricanes and major snow storms.
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid process has been very difficult. It was hard to pay for tuition and earn scholarships. I did receive some financial aid, but not as much as I hoped for. I would talk with a financial aid advisor so the financial aid process is less difficult."
College Freshman,2,"In this area there are different places. When i say 'different' i mean something that i wouldn't normally see in Newark. There are not a lot of fast food places around. The campus isn't too complicated to get around though, so that is good."
College Senior,2,"Get the Meal Plan With Points, NOT Meals – From the moment I arrived at Drew students have been passing around petitions to improve the food, and many others have been developing and sharing creative tricks for putting together an edible meal from what is available. Cereal is always a safe bet, and DIY stir-fry is always a popular option but it tends to be a long wait. The Snack Bar, however, is a good alternative to the main dining hall (The Commons), and special meals like ""Midnight Breakfast"" during finals and Thanksgiving dinner (the Thursday before) are usually great."
College Senior,2,"Strict About the Wrong Things – At this university, alcohol and drug violations are more heavily weighted than behavioral problems."
College Sophomore,2,"Monsoons Are a Weekly – Rains like crazy, which means that you either need to own a pair of rain boots or be prepared to go through many pairs of socks daily. Some of your favorite shoes will be ruined due to the rain and the campus terrain is crazy so huge puddles are very common. The center of campus actually turns into a pond. Also when it snows we lose power which causes the whole semester to be postponed and we rarely ever get classes cancelled."
College Sophomore,2,"Public Safety Will Stop You – The campus public safety officers are very strict and they will break a party up if there is underage drinking. You do not want to be the host of a party with underage drinking because you will get written up and have community service. Drug-use is not tolerated at all and if drugs are found in your room, most likely housing privileges will be taken away."
College Freshman,2,"Not Much Out There – The only people I know who live off-campus are people who commute from home.  Drew has guaranteed four-year housing, and pretty much everyone uses it."
College Sophomore,2,"If a girl doesn't feel well, she is just handed a pregnancy test. She can be a virgin, and she is still given a pregnancy test and then charged for it...

The doctors, when they do examine you however, seem to know what they are doing, and to really care."
College Freshman,2,"If You're a Freshman or Sophomore, Take the Train – The only method of transport that works for freshmen and sophomores is the Madison train station. not a variety of options but it's better than none"
College Freshman,2,Freshman Dorms – Freshman dorms are very small. Space is limited so you must make great use of every bit of it. Upperclassmen have better housing but it's nothing compared to what you'd find in other colleges
College Sophomore,2,"Safety Is Hit or Miss – Public safety is usually present - if you need to call them. There have been break-ins and thefts over holiday breaks, unfortunately performed by someone with a master key - an employee of the university. Lighting is not as widespread as it should be even though Student Government is looking into improving it this semester. As it is I do not feel safe walking alone at night in some areas of the campus. There are emergency phones, but they are rather redundantly placed next to public buildings and not where you might actually need them. I would never go alone to one of the parties here."
College Freshman,2,Mixed Races – Although the majority of the student body is caucasion there is an equal amount of african americans hispanics latinos and other races
College Sophomore,2,"Barely Passing – Our dining hall is nicely kept, but the food is always the same.  Even when the food choices aren't so bad, they've been sitting out most of the time and have become hard or cold.  The only good thing about our dining hall is that there are places for us to get creative and make our own food."
College Junior,2,"Available but Unorganized – Financial aid is readily available but the office tends to be unorganized, often leading to lost checks which result in missed exams which cannot be taken until all fees are payed in full."
College Junior,2,"Public Safety Lacks Luster – There are only two blue-lights on campus, neither of which is in working order and the lamps on campus are few and far between, not to mention how frequently they flicker or go out all together. Our Public Safety Department is meant to aid students but are usually too busy handing out parking tickets to give a lift to a student who needs a ride on or off campus at night, trips to and from the hospital included. It's not an unsafe area, but it is very wooded and there is a lot of wild-life activity at night. There have also been instances of thief activity during school breaks,"
Freshman,1,"Dorms are extremely low quality, even in the newest buildings. Education is definitely not worth the extremely high price tag. Avoid at all costs"
Freshman,1,"I am a fresh at drew and I am also african american . The campus life sucks. There are barely any people of color. Be prepared to deal with racism if you are any race except white. I feel as though they give the black students alot of money because they need us to seem more “diverse” so there’s that  Professors are nice when they want to be. Food sucks but if you looking to lose some weight ... you might accomplish that goal with the food drew serves . Very cliquish , reminds me of highschool. All i do is sleep, do homework, and go back to my dorm. The parties suck the cops always coming because the students are sloppy with alcohol. On my first week at drew someone got drug. It’s a mess. POC should just apply to a school with more diversity. You ever seen get out? Run! do not come here."
Freshman,1,"Over  1 semester I would give it a 0 in stars if I could. Campus life is lack luster here, with only about 1500 students that go here you won't be meeting new faces and after 1 week those friend groups are solidified. If you're looking for sports I would highly recommend looking for a more serious program, the facilities here make Planet Fitness look amazing. Party life is non existent on the campus during the weekends, a typical weekend here looks like a ghost town with the only eating option being the Commons. Dorm situations are particularly awful, the hallways look like a hospital and the rooms are not much better with only 1 small window. For how much this school costs I expected the quality to be much better, instead I'm just disappointed. My expectations are now so low that I'm enlisting in the military instead of continuing another 3 years here.  0/10 IGN - ""Would not recommend to friends or family""."
Junior,1,"Most of the Biology and Chemistry departments as well as majors make you feel as if you are not welcome. They are arrogant. There is rarely anything to do. On the slim chance there is, about 5 people show up...? This school is money hungry they will start out with giving you financial aid but slowly take it away each semester you stay........... This school has an extremely small population. Food isn't good. I'm transferring. I'm telling you this so you don't make the same mistake.  Run."
College Junior,1,"The cost for living here is not worth it. The rooms and beds are not very comfortable. The facilities are always disgusting and messy. There is always a scramble to pick housing and get the best building, and there is only one building that is nice and modern."
College Junior,1,We do not have Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,"no football team 

the soccer team is apparently really good 

i hear the basketball team stinks"
College Freshman,1,"this is not the university I wanted to attend, and i hope to transfer out ASAP"
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek Life at Drew University.
College Sophomore,1,The food is absolutely horrible and the school is known for its poor food quality.
College Sophomore,1,"The commons is awful. The only good things were the DIY pasta and stir fry stations, and they got rid of them. Now there's no pasta and the stir fry has to be made for you. This causes ridiculous lines and contaminated pans. I know this isn't a nut free campus, but if the person before me gets peanut noodles, wiping the pan with the same towel they've been using for the whole dinner service isn't gonna do it. 

The EC is better, but the service is super slow. 

Oh, and the vegetarian/vegan option is a cardboard gardenburger. That's it."
College Freshman,1,I'm Transferring. A lot of the teachers (in my departments) suck. The school is not challenging....I have a 3.0 GPA and never really studied or worked hard and I learn't nothing. But some things are nice like the clubs that I am in..but they are not enough to keep me at the school.
College Freshman,1,We Suck..like every team. Soccer games are fun to attend. We are good at Fencing and Riding..D1
College Freshman,1,A lot of places to choose from
College Freshman,1,Theater Major. Some teachers suck. A LOT of busy work. Nothing learned.
College Freshman,1,"Commons food is terrible, EC is ok but still not very good."
College Freshman,1,"All freshman dorms are like prison cells, there is no air conditioning, and the walls are very thin. The bathrooms are disgusting, and if one toilet backs up, they all do and it sometimes takes days to fix. The rooms are small, and there isn't good circulation unless you have the door open. People tend to be loud at the wrong times, such as early in the morning or late at night. If you have a populated floor above you, you hear every step they take. The lounges are mediocre, and the furniture in the closed lounges are low quality. There isn't much to do on weekends, and most people go home. The showers are always dirty or covered in hair, and sometimes the drains are clogged and the water with all the filth rises up and touches your feet. The water pressure is very poor and the water itself is hard and dries out everything, from your hair to your skin. You don't feel clean after using them."
College Freshman,1,"The only parties that exist are very small, and because of the low population of the student body, you will not see anyone you don't know from your own class. For girls, there is a very rapey vibe, and there doesn't seem to be much of a chance of going to a party without being bothered by some guy. For guys, there aren't a lot of girls here, and a lot of them are either dirty or in relationships or mentally unstable. People get too drunk too fast and public safety sit outside and let them go on, unless they're in some place besides the suites."
College Freshman,1,"The department of Public Safety are nice, until you bring non-white or not straight friend to campus. They are very discriminatory and will only stop you at the gate if you look ""suspicious"". They will tow your car without warning if you park incorrectly, and give you a number of tickets. They talk to people as if they are criminals even when they are not responsible for anything. They go against their own conduct guide, Daniel's Dictionary, in various ways. They do not make anyone feel safe, and it seems as though their only concern is busting parties and/or drugs and giving out tickets. I do not feel as though they are concerned with the actual safety of the students. They do not drive safely around campus. They falsify their police reports against people to get them in trouble if they don't personally like them. The only person with a soul is the chief, who is the one in charge of them, but usually has no effect on their behavior towards students and guests. The policies are ridiculous, and are stricter than state laws."
College Freshman,1,"Small dorms, halls smell, very loud, 10-15 minute walk to classes, not very clean, showers are terrible, some RAs are better than others"

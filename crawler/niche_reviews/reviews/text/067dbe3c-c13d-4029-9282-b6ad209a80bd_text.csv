Sophomore,5,"I'm a student from the Bahamas currently enrolled at the great LU. Langston University is one of the best experiences thus far since birth, for it provided me with numerous life lessons and morals. Langston University has also introduced me to a vast amount of new cultures, experiences, friends, and even a higher form of learning. This is why I wouldn't change institutions for anything. However, it has also been the eminent cause of stress and hardship among me and my mother. Honestly, there is not much support or resources that are equipped to assist foreigners. Therefore, I'm barely surviving on campus. Currently, I have a 3.90 accumulative GPA, I'm in the Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity, Caribbean Student Organization, and other organizations.
Thus, leaving me with the roaming question of why can't I get Honor's scholarship or other small scholarships the university usually hands out when I specifically meet all requirements? It's mesmerizing, honestly!"
Sophomore,5,My overall experience at Langston University would be excellent and so much more. I’ve learned things about myself I did not know and have made long time friendships that I will not forget. I was not too sure about how I would feel about Langston University at first but once I got comfortable and made friends I definitely think that Langston has made an impact on my life.
Sophomore,5,"I hate that Langston has such a bad reputation in the state of Oklahoma because it's their only HBCU and Oklahoma is very racist. I wish everyone would see the wonderful things we do on campus instead of all the ""incidents"". We have the top goat research facility in the world, people come to visit and contact us just to help them with their clinical trials and studies. As well as we work with NASA on how to help an astronaut's immune system while in space and what works better herbs and remedies or western medications while they are in space."
Sophomore,5,Langston overall is a great school. It gives many students a chance to find their outlet and become a unit underneath the title of the school.  All universities has their own flaws within themselves but being at Langston has helped with my character and self traits overall.
Sophomore,5,This year while on lockdown we had to take online classes. At first it was hard because I never had tooken online classes and I didn't know if I was going to stay focused like I would in a regular class. But turned out I still focus in class and got good grades. Our professors are always emailing you making sure that you get your work done checking in on you. They act like your auntie and your uncle.
Sophomore,5,Langston University is a family establishment. It makes you feel like you're at home. Everybody is so kind to staff is always on their grind and the student leaders are awesome. Our school may be small but our spirit is not. Come over to Langston and we'll give you a grand tour.
Niche User,5,My experience was great on my college visit it showed me a lot about the campus and the history behind it and what their mission and plans on for their school and students and the vibes there are mixed so well to the point where it feels like it's your little world you always dreamed of. What I also like about Langston is that even though it is an HBCU it has its mixtures of race and religion and that's what I love so much about Langston and the staff there are so chill and relax and they give you the information you need instead of the schools saying and telling you stuff you want to hear.

Sophomore,5,"I would recommend coming to Langston despite the reputation it holds. They focus a lot on education and bettering the campus. I play volleyball so their athletics programs are pretty great, our coaches focus a lot on being a student first then an athlete. We have a really good football team as well as band. I'm also a student ambassador so we go around to other campus and we represent Langston, we give tours to incoming freshmens/transfers, and we also host campus events. The dorm life is also great as well, the campus and students are very welcoming and if you come here you'll enjoy our time here."

WIth loving and friendly people who love to learn and be educated within our culture the HBCU way.  The one thing Langston University can improve on is making sure people can get back in school even with a bill so they can make something of yourself . and change the cafeteria food. It could be more options when it comes to being in a cafeteria
Sophomore,5,"I am currently enrolled to begin the nursing program. From what I have come  across it seems to be am excellent choice of college. The staff seems to be available and offers to help make things easier. I am not sure about the campus life style because I live at home with my husband and children, but from what I hear it is not too bad. The price is also not horrible"
Sophomore,5,"Langston University is a great school for those who want to escape society for a while. Is campus-country setting provides great comfort and clean air. Academically, LU seeks to make it so every student can succeed at their own pace. There hardly anything that would need to be changed. However, food values need a dramatic increase"
Freshman,5,"absolutely love Langston university, all of my professors want me to pass and help me out with everything I need. I am in an organization called The Dolls Dance Co. and I love every opportunity I’ve had being able to be around all the other students and organizations."

I have never had that security. I'm looking forward to the educational experience here and making life long friends.

I love everything about my school and how they help us with anything that we need help with."
Niche User,5,"I absolutely love Langston university. The staff is very friendly and family oriented and they make sure you feel very welcomed.

Freshman,5,My first year at Langston was an easy process and wasn't hard to get the classes I needed. Teachers and curriculum work to be expected. Easy to get the help you need.
Junior,5,"I attend the OKC/LU campus in Oklahoma City. The classes are small, but the teachers are great. I like the one on one attention you get in small classes. The main campus works hard to bring the main campus to the city campus. This makes us feel apart of the school."
Junior,5,I transferred here last semester spring 2018 and it was the best  decision  I have ever made. I was scared about being new but they welcomed me with open arms. I also Love the environment and the culture is amazing!

It’s sureounded by people you are familiar with, and is like one big family. You have small classes so you can pay attention, and get the extra help you need from your professors. The environment is great and the atmosphere is what I love most. Some things I would like to see change is the way things are organized. Add more things around school like better food, and more resources we can need."
Senior,5,"I am Oneka Cayenne. I am a senior at Langston University in Langston, OK. I was born and raised I Brooklyn, NY. I originally came out to Langston because of my mentor receiving a job offer here. Langston accepted right away and every since I step foot here, I fell in love. This was my first HBCU, from the friendly students, faculty, and staff, to the Greeks hosting events, to the outstanding tutors, I knew this school was it. Although, it is my last year and like other other seniors I cannot wait to graduate, but I will miss this school dearly, and the hard times of being stressed and crying my eyes out from all the work I was receiving including the work I volunteered to do around the campus. I was in the University's concert choir, apart of the production team recording graduations, honors day and such. I will forever have a place for Langston University."

I love the hospitality and the joy, we as first time freshman have recieved from the  staff and students. They offer a very broad choice of organizations for everyone to choose from. Getting around campus wasn’t difficult and there were people to help if we needed it. I can’t stress the issue enough that this was a great choice of school for me and many others."
Senior,5,"I love the support system at my school, there always someone there reaching out to help when you need it."
Freshman,5,I went for a visit and it was fun and informative. I loved the atmosphere as well as the Physical Therapy program is awesome. I look forward to being a part of a HBCU and the historical experience. I do hope to pass this experience down to my children one day. I was impressed with the small classes. It really put my mind at ease.
Freshman,5,"My experience here at Langston was very rocky in the beginning coming miles away from home to a state i didn’t know without a car. Enrolling into a school with nothing very close around everything is further out and towards the city. I did enjoy the school parties the classes and the games. Our campus isn’t that big but it’s a good size. I like that the classes aren’t all big some are small, how our library is open late nights and early mornings. I Love that our school professors and administrators interact with us on campus. I don’t enjoy or cafe food, that’s one thing i wish the school would invest money in and into the schools WiFi. Academically the school is great with teaching and you’ll learn something new every day."
Freshman,5,"Great school! I love my HBCU, everyone is welcoming and relatable. A family like environment. Much love"
Freshman,5,"Langston has many more opportunities than I expected. I would love to see more students, especially freshman, use their resources on campus and join clubs such as sga, wop, ambassadors, etc."
Freshman,5,"Regarding Langston University, I find this institution to be very beneficial and resourceful. You must take the initiative and do the research but the valuable resources are definitely available. The only downfall is that it is limited outside resources for off campus life."
Freshman,5,"What i like about langston is that everyone is nice and respectful for what others do, everyone encourage eachother and positive vibes everywhere, what i would like to see change about Langston is the exciting things i want more excitement"

Junior,5,Langston is a good HBCU. Great professors and student life. Really enjoy being a full time student. From the cafeteria to the dorms it's good being away from home.

Freshman,5,I had a really great experience at Langston. I loved the fact that the class sizes were small and that you had a lot of time for one on ones with professors. I would like to see a new work out room.
Senior,5,"I love Langston.  You're able to walk in to the Dean's office without an appointment and get help.  Big companies like Boeing/Hormel/OneOK actively recruit us and offer jobs/internships and the partnership with the USDA/NASA is incredible.  You can get a private room as a freshman and it's the lowest tuition of university in Oklahoma.  If you keep your gpa up at Langston (free tutoring will help), the sky is the limit."
Sophomore,4,"Being at the only Historically Black College University in Oklahoma has definitely taught me things I didn’t not know about African American people. It is not a big campus, but the people make it so much more than the campus. They provide resources to further go in depth into your education such as tutors, English center (to help with writing), and the library of course is always open for use. When we had to switch to online courses the professors communicated for well to ensure that we were completely capable of getting the assignments needed to do the work in order to complete the class. Although I was not very fond of online classes I think Langston University communicated with its students very well due to the pandemic."
Sophomore,4,Langston is a great HBCU. They will bring you out your shell and make you feel at home. I love how it’s so much pride going around. I love how a lot of people are opened up and are willing to help other people to open up. I’m one of those shy people that doesn’t open up until I get to know you. Being at Langston University changed that. I’m not as shy as I used to be. I’m more opened and outgoing about stuff. I’ve made tons of new friends there. It’s always positive energy no matter where you go on campus. I never seen not one person never smiling. It’s always smiles and laughter when you walk around and that’s what I love.
Senior,4,While being at Langston University I have been surrounded by culture all of which I feel I have been a little out of touch with in recent things such as this in past years but I feel that the more I am around it the more I can accommodate.
Senior,4,The online program is very straight forward so it isn't very hard to figure it out its more of getting used to the system and once you do that you will be fine to achieve your greatness.
Freshman,4,My experience at Langston University has been a great one because of the education and the campus. The profs. at the school make sure that they are helping you pass and make it all the way to graduation.
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Langston University has been very inclusive, fun and memorable. I’ve experienced more at my institution than I have at my regular home state and I am grateful for the people I’ve met and opportunities I have been given.

Freshman,4,"My experience at Langston Unversity has been great, I like how they make the school fun and motivating. I like how we come together and work as a team. What i will change on this campus is start ahead of time rather than starting late.  I like to make sure my work is turned in ahead of time just in case something happens. This school helps you communicate with others and get social more. They have games and organizations to help you grow and interact with other students. evryone is not from the same state so you learn a lot from a person thats not from Oklahoma City.  You can gain a lot from other people."
Junior,4,My experience at Langston University is really a blessing. The only thing I'll change about my campus is the cafe food. I take my school as a blessing just because of how I didnt think myself as a first generation student will make it through. Also my dad attended the school so I wanted to keep the legacy going.
Freshman,4,My Langston experience is one that cannot be duplicated. It is very lively on a daily basis and the student are very diverse and friendly. The student base is like family and are always willing to help each other out. Over all a great place to be a part of

Freshman,4,"This University makes sure that college students get the education that they deserve just like any other college. But this particular college is wanting to break the continuing cycle of kids not being able to get an education that they've wanted. They are very determined to get in the minds of students by education. Teaching Us all we need to know in order to do something with our lives instead of doing nothing with it. To actually say ""we have a degree"". They try to improve they're method every year to keep students in college, by improving the teaching method, dorms, food, buildings, libraries and etc. My experience at this university have been absolutely amazing. Being apart of this is like being with my family back at home. My roommates are nice and so are my peers on this campus.  The students and the workers here are nothing but such encouraging, pleasurable, heart felt people I have ever met. I might be a freshmen but it already feels like I have been here for a long time."
Sophomore,4,Langston has some awesome people here who are genuinely willing to help you as long as they see you are putting forth the effort. It is more like a big family here.

If I could chose Langston all over again; I would. It has been an amazing experience and I have LU to thank for that."

Freshman,4,"I’m from California and my experience at Langston has been a completely different experience then what I am used to because it’s in a whole other state. So when I had visited the school for the first time I was amazed by how the people were so different, like the way the talked and mannerism. But the best part about the school is the on campus lifestyle; the students and faculty were so full of energy and excitement, and so proud to be a Langston Lion, and that energy really made me feel welcomed with open-arms."

Especially when we have rivals against other schools you would never knew how many fans are rooting for you."

Being my first college experience I'd say it has given me a pretty decent look of how to prepare for the next step in my book of goals. The professors here care about your future, and will do their best to help you carry out your goals. This university offers a great learning environment to help you obtain the proper education you desire. Off the books, the campus lifestyle is good aswell. The students and faculty for the most part are really friendly. Everyone wants to see everyone succeed. If you need any information, they're ready to assist in any way they can. This is a great college and I recommend this university to any and all who's interested in a brighter future."
Senior,4,"Langston has created a family-oriented environment. I know once i graduate, I can always come back to my home away from home. Langston University does their due diligence to hire staff that want to see their student succeed and thrive in their desired career path. With a motto ""Education for Service"", LAngston has enstilled the values of giving back to your community. Organizations are encouraged or even required to participate in community service activities at least twice a semester.

However , they have been working to solve this problem."

There are a lot of people from all over the world coming to langston to take on college, but just not enough different cultures, and colors. I think that the campus is great for people who want to feel independence because there are different types of dorms you can get which are traditional and apartment styled. You meet lots of new, friendly people here at Langston and they make sure to make sure you love your stay!"
Freshman,4,I Love how Langston is a big family once you get settled in and actually attend stuff you would understand what I mean.  I Would fix the food & the activities around the clock because it does get boring sometimes
Senior,4,I love Langston University it’s still a divers college. I love how family oriented it is how loving it is.
Freshman,4,"I am a new incoming freshman at Langston university. I live about 35 minutes away from my house. I love the atmosphere here at Langston because I can relate to being around African-American students who love to learn. As being the only Hbcu in Oklahoma we have multiple parties and events going on every week. There going to be time for a lot of fun, but you also have to manage your on time to be successful. Therefore, the change I willing to see Langston university is to be more active with influencing incoming freshman to study more and less partying. The more you study the easier it is to focus on just yourself."
Sophomore,4,"At Langston, it was a second home, everyone knows each other, we are literally a big family at Langston University, majority of the professors were really nice and helpful, they got a chance to get to know each of their students no matter how big or small the classes are. I learned so much being at Langston University, I learned how to be responsible, I learned how to balance out my personal life, class and work. I don't regret attending Langston at all."
Sophomore,4,"I love how everyone looks out for one another at Langston, even faculty. The only thing that needs improvement is the quality of food served in the cafeteria."
Freshman,4,it is a  very small college everyone knows everyone the teachers are very helpful and understanding of how much stress a college student goes through
Freshman,4,"Only being on campus for a semester and a half, I've enjoyed my experience here at Langston University. Not only do the instructors make sure that you are understanding what is being taught in class, they work alongside with you so that you know"
Sophomore,4,I love the people and how they are so welcoming here. Going here has brought me out of my shyness and has made me an out-going person. I love going to the events and having fun.
Freshman,4,"Langston is a very great school .They help you the best way they can. They are not like other school,where they just show up and don't really help the students."
Freshman,4,Langston is an extremely lively school with a mostly fun and upbeat atmosphere. Attending here will ensure you receive valuable information in courses from your instructors.
Freshman,4,My first experience about langston was that it is a great school. It have great teachers administrator's etc
Sophomore,4,"I like Langston because it is a small university, so  you are able to get one on one attention with the professors."
Freshman,4,"My experience as a college freshman has been great, getting to know myself more and learning responsibility is what helped me grow more into my young adulthood."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman,  only have attended one semester but I have experienced a lot. Equally good and bad. Langston NEEDS to work on better housing specifically for freshmen!! Remodeling is very much needed and more ON TIME mechanics!!! Everything else is fine, learning to love my HBCU."
Freshman,4,I love langston! Langston is one of those colleges that help you mold yourself into what you want to be but you have to want it yourself. Once I stepped on campus it felt like home I was some comfortable there and everyone is nice.
Senior,2,I would like to see better organization when it comes to new student process. The professors are great but the communication has a large gap between departments.
College Freshman,2,Not what I expected in a dorm life
College Junior,2,"I chose to return to Langston University to finished where I started. Unfortunately for me, they have denied my financial aid benefits and have not considered my transferring work as adequate proof that I am serious about finishing my degree through them. It hurts to know that I cannot be accepted."
College Sophomore,2,"Langston's housing situation is out of control. Student affairs needs to get the housing situation together very soon. There shouldn't be any uncertainty about where students are staying in the middle of the school year. I was locked out of my house at 8 o'clock at night in the middle of the school week with no warning. they had no housing accommodations for the night and didn't even have a definite room for me the next day. The roommates in my new room said they had moved four people (two of which were of the opposite gender) in the room that became my room for the rest of the semester. I like that we're supposed to have our own rooms, but it doesn't excuse the fact that they have been so ill prepared for housing the past few years."
College Freshman,2,"sometimes it's cool to live on campus sometimes it's not.. I mean, Langston IS a party school, so sometimes it's hard to sleep because the walls are so hallow. the maintenance SUCKS. we have a bad leak in our bathroom & they still haven't fixed it.. no matter how many times we complain about it"
College Freshman,2,all we have are numerous basketball courts & probably 1 treadmill.
College Sophomore,2,I feel as though campus police just want to bother the students more than protect them. They always want to throw someone in Logan County Jail. They pull people over and give out more tickets than the regular police. There are no special security measures at all. I feel safe on campus but not because they protect me but because I know how to protect myself.
College Freshman,2,We have a major problem with dorm break-ins and police and administration aren't very active on the situation.
College Junior,2,"The only thing that's upsetting about Langston's security is that the police don't care weather or not your room is broken into or something of your is stolen, they are lazy, self centered, and something needs to be done. The only thing they do is stop and pull over students and hand out tickets for no reason. Langston campus polices needs to start caring more about the students safety"
College Sophomore,2,Not alot of options or to expensive or far
College Freshman,2,The Cafe messes up my stomach every time I eat in there. I've just come to the conclusion that I'll just eat in my room.
College Freshman,2,could be better only care about drugs not peoples property .
College Senior,2,"Closest town is guthrie, very minimal dining places and most are chain restaurants that are poorly ran due to the small town."
College Freshman,2,Nearest schools date at least 30-45 minutes away the only time there is any integration between the schools is when there is a big party goin on
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car, you have no options. The closest restaurant is about a 10 minute drive which is a subway. Everything else is about 20-30 minutes away, including the grocery store."
College Freshman,2,Coming from a big highschool in texas it is nothing compared to highschool sports.
College Junior,2,"since there is nothing in the town, we have to do out of town which is about 10mins away"
College Sophomore,2,Top far away from campus
College Senior,2,There is only subway and snack machines.
College Senior,2,"There were miscommunication that left me having to search for different aids at the last minute and my options are not very much. Dispersement is usually on time and good but not good with letting you know that you wont be getting financial assistance. It had definitely taken a tool on me, leaving me discouraged."
College Senior,2,Langston in Tulsa is a small campus and so athletics at school are not very common and popular throughout. Mainly that campus is focused on nursing and from being there for just a year I don't see much focus on sports because the main campus is in Oklahoma City which I'm sure is more widely known for their sports.
College Senior,2,"Each semester I constantly struggle, how I am holding on now is a blessing."
College Senior,2,"I been in the café a few times, its not all that. I actually enjoyed the school I transferred from better."
College Senior,2,"There is only one campus hangout which is the student success which is always overcrowded, no restaurants on campus except for a overly price chicken place in which not everyone eats chicken or meat."
College Senior,2,"I dread living on campus, the residents nearby have no respect by being extremely noisy I had to find several complaints, some of the dorms including mines had mole infested in the showers, my roommates were lazy and didn't like to clean up after their selves."
College Junior,2,"Have not looked into such, so I can answer this question"
College Sophomore,2,There is sometimes a certain disconnect between students and administration and the police that work with administration. The levels of respect are sometimes misunderstood and power is definitely and influence.
College Freshman,2,they gave me the run around
College Freshman,2,The Secretary doesn't do anything. She is no help at all and she repeats herself every time you go to financial aid
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid was a huge headache, there are too many weekends where we are looking for something to do and we end up in our rooms watching TV all night, without a car you might die from boredom and repetition after two weeks of staying on campus. Academics are pretty good and Greek life is excellent."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't any real attractions, activities, or anything in Langston. We have a gas station, a subway restaurant, and a trolley that takes us to Guthrie and to the mall in Oklahoma City on some weekends throughout the month."
College Freshman,2,"I will be honest... Greek life is really all this school has to offer. Basketball: not good, Football: it's okay, really all I can say."
College Sophomore,2,"I Feel Like They Should Have More Of A Variety , Because We Have The Same Thing Every Other Day ."
College Freshman,2,I honestly do not think there is a problem with drugs but with alcohol more so. I have noticed a lot of underage drinking.
College Junior,2,The safety is the best thing on campus besides the classroom. The cons would be the financial aid assistants and the parking rates .
College Junior,2,There really isn't to many fan supporters on campus
College Junior,2,I'm not to much of a party student but the party scene usually is above average.
College Junior,2,Financial aid is always the biggest problem we have here on campus. They could do a better job of getting the information that we need to receive our financial aid on time.
College Junior,2,The drug scene on campus is forbidden but of course some students do not follow this. Peer pressure isn't a problem here on campus because majority of the student population have a mind of their own and they follow their own mind set.
College Junior,2,The cost of parking is very unreasonable at times and the tickets are ridiculous they should have a better way this should be set up. Our campus is pretty small so I never understood why does is cost so much for a parking permit. 
College Freshman,2,"Drugs and alcohol are not allowed on campus at all. Staff and officer know that when there's a party many students are going to drink, so they watch out for what's going to happen. If you sneak and do drugs or alcohol just try not to get caught or there will be consequences. You can get expelled or sent to jail. "
College Sophomore,2,Langston offers a lot of scholarships but it is not as easy to obtain one. i have applied many times and i meet all qualifications but i have yet to receive a scholarship.luckily my financial aid helps me but its very stressful trying to return every semester worried about how i am going to pay for school.
College Sophomore,2,Langston is a very small town so you would have to go to Edmond or even Guthrie for entertainment
College Senior,2,"LU offers scholarships, but it's only worth a few hundred dollars. But still yet, every little bit counts."
College Sophomore,2,"It really wasn't too difficult getting into the program.  Of course you have to carry at least a 2.5 GPA and there are certain courses you have to have before entering the Nursing program.  The reason I rate this a C is because of the Financial Aid person.  She is VERY DIFFICULT and NOT a very nice person AT ALL!  I have not spoken with anyone that likes her at all.  She is extremely MEAN to you.  Not helpful AT ALL.
The tips I can offer your are Do the Best you Can with your Studies and Make the Best Grades you can."
College Freshman,2,The diversity at Langston is pretty good. There's a lot of different religions and ethic diversity.
College Freshman,2,"Its cool sometimes! People hang out every once in a while. Its not the same like the beginning of the year when we stayed outside. We use to have parties, after parties and kick backs. Now the nightlife is not all that. The students dont even have school spirit. After parties you suppose to stay out and enjoy the night. People go in when can just kick back and enjoy the fun. If you don'thave a lady friend you would be so bored. Getting under my chick is my nightlife."
College Junior,2,There is not much around campus. We would have to travel to have fun.
College Sophomore,2,"Some folks still need their parents , but some folks at Langston are cool when they want to be , I keep my circle very limited people I've known for years. Can't trust everybody."
College Junior,2,The bus that take us to Guthrie stops running after three.
College Sophomore,2,Not Good – Since Langston University's location is in the middle of nowhere everything is far away I have gone to Buffalo Wild Wings once which is okay but I haven't been out much do to how far everything is from our school.
College Junior,2,"Girls Are Ghetto – The girls at Langston are confused, loud, very promiscuous, and style can come off slutty. There are only a hand full of girls that are classy"
College Sophomore,2,"If you dont have a car or you dont know anyone that has a car, then it is hard to get around. Period. Everything that you wnt to get to is 10 to 45 to an 1hr away. Depends on where you want to go.  Dont think that 10 min is nothing.  We on a long road that seems like it takes 10 min to get off of it so yea.  Everything is a long way and the mall is an hr depends on which one you go to in OKC."
College Freshman,2,no drugs really. drinking is a much more popular activity.
College Freshman,2,"The School Helps You – The teachers help you when you need it but you have to ask or you will go unnoticed. The rules are enforced by the president, but if you don't get caught doing something then you can get away with it. If you do get caught that is a whole nother story you get put on trial and have to fight to stay in school."
College Sophomore,2,"I Don't Know – When I ate in the dining it suck, I didn't like it. My high school was way better than Langston dining. Now I hear its way better, so maybe they did come up since my freshman year."
College Senior,2,"Not the Main Campus – Though this is a new building, there are few books in the library (maybe one book case or less). It could get better and hopefully it will."
College Sophomore,2,"Not So Great – There are times when I feel that the process could be easier, but usually if I have questions they get answered. It's just that its a very hard and confusing process and I would like for my information and instructions to be a little more clear at times."
College Freshman,2,Campus Safety – Our campus police try their best to keep us protected but like most schools sometimes things happen when we have too many non students on our campus.
College Junior,2,"My Campus – If I could describe my Langston University campus I would have to say that it is overall average, but there are several changes and renovations that need to be made. First and foremost, we have no student union (student center), there is one being built and it has been under construction for the past two years. Second, there could be more campus activities for the students to endulge in at least once or twice a month. None the less, I just think there should be more facilities other than the ""yard"" to hangout and socialize."
Freshman,1,They don’t care weather you have a computer or WiFi they’ll tell you that they don’t remember the conversation you guys had in the phone and it’s just better in class face to face
College Freshman,1,did not really attend parties or things like that.
College Student,1,We are not big on sports at all really. I mean we do a little bit but not much
College Freshman,1,I stated this in a previous review.
College Sophomore,1,They give you the run around in each process
Recent Alumnus,1,It is not in a college town so there isnt much of a party scene.
College Junior,1,Their is no on-campus housing at Langston Tulsa
College Junior,1,Their is no Greek life on the Tulsa campus.
College Junior,1,Their are no athletics at the Langston Tulsa campus.
College Junior,1,"Langston Tulsa is not a campus that has on-campus living, so their aren't any parties that aren't related to school."
College Sophomore,1,They are slow in getting you aid and then they do not help at all
College Sophomore,1,I am not into he greek
College Freshman,1,The off campus dining by Langston University is very poor. It takes about 20 minutes to get to the nearest off-campus dining and all there is to choose from is mainly cheap fast food restaurants such as McDonalds or Sonic. There is nowhere I would recommend anyway to check out. There is also nowhere that offers student discount.
College Freshman,1,The bus will not wait on passengers they take if they are not there on time. It takes 3 hours fro the bus to leave each destination. The bus mostly comes while students are in class or at practice.
College Freshman,1,"It sucks!!! I never expected this, I really don't want to go any further with this topic because it's making me mad just thinking about this process. I wondered are all colleges like this. Little to no help from ""so-called - advisers."""
College Freshman,1,"I cannot think of anything that really makes this school stand out, I've seen Greek life way better at other schools. Not trying to be harsh, but it's just not really a school I just recommend to someone."
College Freshman,1,We don't have any nightlife. We have an eleven o'clock curfew that's what we have. The only parties that don't get shut down are the ones we have to pay for on the weekends off campus. As far as nightlife goes the college stinks. I wouldn't base this college on nightlife... never.
College Junior,1,"The weather is okay at times, but the cold can be unbearable at times and this puts a damper on the spirit and the ability to do things on campus"
College Junior,1,We are in the middle of no where! So most students need a car if they are not available to receive a ride by a friend! 
College Junior,1,The dining is very horrible! They do not have a variety of foods for us students to eat nor do they stay open late to our convenience and that is very unreliable.
College Senior,1,"The drug scene on Campus is rapid. I know a lot of people smoke and do other drugs such as Ecstasy and smoke marijuana. I don't think their is a lot a peer pressure because if i were to tell someone i don't smoke or drink they are okay and respect my decision. I know that i have seen drug dogs out before and the front gate inspecting cars. I think they enforce great security measures, but of course they cant know or inspect everyone at all times."
College Freshman,1,you can stay in the village but your house may not  stand up to 20 mph winds
College Junior,1,"Unless you have a car or know someone who has one, you'll more than likely stay in your room, mainly on the weekends (Friday-Sunday)."
College Freshman,1,it wasn't enough to even cover the first semester.
College Freshman,1,"When you enroll or get your classes, be sure to MAKE financial aid put you in your right classes for your major. I wanted to major in sociology  but they put me down as criminal justice. I have a friend whos major was supost to be a business major, but later we found out they had put her major as a child development. Ive also heard plenty of stories of financial aid putting people in the wrong classes. Also ive had friends who had sat in a class the whole semester but then to find out they arnt in the class, so they end up having an F in the class they had no idea about."
College Sophomore,1,It needs more rebuilding and different & exciting colors and the roads need to be more smoother.
College Junior,1,Campus Staff Is Irresponsible – Students have a hard time recieving complete and accurate information from campus staff regarding information needed to move forward with their education. A lot of times campus staff fail to meet deadlines with financial aid because of information they forget to give to students that they must turn in. They can be very rude and make students feel alone on their quest to obtain a desent education.
College Sophomore,1,"Athletic Center – The athletic center here at Langston University is really horrible, unless you're interested in football or basketball.  Women's bball is really good.  They are great dominators.  Football is good but they are the only University that I have seen or heard about that has such a short season.  Track is something that I cannot get into.  It is one that is not good at all.  There is no preparation in trying to get anything together.  Cocahes do not know the exact procedures of how to conduct the appropriate plan for their runners. Softball is nice.  Even though we dont have a field, they make it work and they do a good job at it also."
College Freshman,1,You will never know exactly how the weather will be. Somedays its extremely hot and others it can be cold.It could be a thunderstorm one night and the next day its nice and hot. We have tornadoes.
College Freshman,1,"Uuuh,Don't really know I don't go to any of the games. I always see, cross-cuntry/Track Athletes Running. They Run A lnog Ways, Ecpecially Considering The Fact The Langston Is In The Middle Of Nowhere All there is, is space And Roads"
College Senior,1,Graduate Student – Financial Aid is very limited. Financial Aid staff very bad at doing their job.
College Freshman,1,"You Have to Look Hard for Things – When trying to find important information you have to run around campus, and get the run around half of the time you are searching. When you finally do find some type of useful infromation the deadline has already past."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much to Do – Langston is in the middle of nowhere, especially if you don't have a car. Oklahoma is known for a races town which they are. We're the only HBCU there and doesn't feel great at times. For the most part it's cool, but it could be better."
College Sophomore,1,There Is None – There is no off campus housing that I am aware of.
College Junior,1,Not Easily Accessible Networks – The WiFi on campus rarely works and you need a password that is not provided. Computer labs are usually crowded and half of the computers won't let you log on.
College Junior,1,There is absolutely nothing in the town of Langston except the university. There is not even a high school.
College Freshman,1,Recently... Ice Storm. Superbowl Sunday Night – In the past week there was a ice storm and school was out for 4 days. I slipped on ice and fell on my back while walking today. Even though this entire weekend the campus was supposed to clearing the streets and sidewalks in preparation for school to start tomorrow on Monday. During the ice storm i was afraid to leave my house because I'd have to risk being injured while walking down the snowy and iced three set on stairs i have to travel down to just to get on the ground.
College Freshman,1,"The Cost is extremely expensive for the poor quality education received at this institution. The Convenience is low because this University is located in a small town that has old houses and shut down restaurants. In order to obtain groceries, go to Clubs, Malls or fast food restaurants you have to have a car or know someone with a car that can drive you to the nearest town which is Guthrie approx. 23 miles away. Then the city is approx. 53 miles south of Langston. They have a free trolley only on school days during classes to get people to guthrie for groceries at either Wal-Mart, Homeland or Dollar General. They also have a Shuttle but it cost about 90 dollars to get to oklahoma city and another 90$ to get back."
College Student,1,Alcohol Use – As a first year student I noticed that the alcohol cosumption was above average. There was a liqour store right down the street from the campus that students could walk to.
College Junior,1,"Living on Campus – Living on campus has its good adn bad qualities. The thing that I like the most is they do not require the incoming freshman to live in dorms, however, there is one dormitory still open but it is used when there is no more vacant rooms in the apartments and the recruits. The social atmosphere on campus it cool, people are always outside hanging out except when the weather is bad. Also the cost is okay but it could be reduced because we pay close to $3000 dollars per semester to live on campus instead of for the whole year. The convenience aspect of living on campus also has its good and bad qualities. Unfortunately we have to take a 10 to 30 minute drive to get to food, shopping, and the ""big"" stuff because we're in the middle of no where."

Senior,5,"I Have Spent My My Four years of college with Texas College and it has made me into a better woman than what I was better and it teaches you that nothing is handed to you , if you want something you have to work for it and earn it ."
Senior,5,"I love the diversity on the campus and the culture. When i first got there I was a young child that was raised in California and dint know what it was like to be a ""Texan"". The adjustment wasn't hard only because my freshman class was the biggest one in years so they had a lot for us to be involved in."
Freshman,5,i like because this school is a really good school this is a important in my life so i like this school this is perfect ppor me and my feature so i like is a good schol and education and other the profesor and everything is a good i like this school tihis is my favorite school so im go to the texas college
Niche User,5,This seems like a really good college. It has all the things that interests me about what I want to have at my future college and the activities too.
Niche User,5,Texas College is an HBCU 1894. When I went there for the basketball rival weekend the campus was clean and quite. During the basketball game your were actually able to sit and watch the game. What I think that needs to change at Texas College is that we need more activities to do on campus other than hanging out in the game room.
Junior,5,This School is focused on education and leadership.  The band is up and coming and the Choir is the feature of the whole East Texas region. Not alot of parties this is a Christian school so our focus is strong.
Freshman,5,Well I'm barely gonna be a freshman in college this fall but I visited during the summer and really liked it
Senior,5,Texas College has been a great experience for me. I have learned so much. Life lessons as well as educationally. I have met so many amazing people and also pleaded the greatest fraternity. Phi Beta Sigma fraternity Inc.
Junior,5,"Texas College is a historically black university butis very diverse.  They offer an array of services geared to anyone who desires a degree. School is offered at different times for those individuals with different needs. Traditional students can go to school during the day or evening. Then you have the Success Students, whose classes are offered during the evening for the working adults. This program allows that individual who desires to go back to school but also has to work to take care of their family. There is no age limit in going back to school so there are those students who are in there 70s in class with the 20 year olds. Everyone is so encouraging and uplifting to everyone.  You feela sense of pride and motivation to keep pushing toward your dream of becoming a college graduate"
Sophomore,5,What I like about Texas College was the culture behind it and all the Greeks and sororities. I also liked that there was never a dull moment on the campus.
Junior,5,"Texas College is a HBCU, my professors and peers are great people. We are the oldest HBCU in East Texas. Our sport facilities could use more space, for example, we need more than one gym on our campus. Or a on campus football field would be great for our football players, therefor when we play teams we no longer have to visit the high school stadium. Updated computers would be a great, we can access more things."
Freshman,5,This campus opened various doors into my future. As an incoming freshmen I was quite nervous as to what the outcome of my first semester would be. Going out of my town to attend was by far the greatest decision I have taken in my entire life. I learned various aspects of every subject upon completing my basic core courses. I am very thankful for every professor that helped me as well.
College Sophomore,5,I would recommend my school to anybody who truly wants to go to college but just cant get accepted anywhere. Most people would just go to the next step and go to a junior college. My school is a 4 year open admission school. So everyone is accepted. Teachers actually care about the students that comes to class and actually want to learn. It's a small school so everyone knows each other and that makes us one big happy dysfunctional family.
College Sophomore,5,"I  love my school because i felt welcomed when first i join the school and what makes me unique too is that am international student and am doing well in class and in sports my GPA is 4.0 and am very respectful girl, and i also like helping other student when they have problem in maths"
College Junior,5,Career day is a involvement of all students where the executives of Major Corporations interview students. We have a great turnout.
College Junior,5,I think we have the best teachers and Professors in the world. My opinion!
College Sophomore,5,The facility has nutrients for major growth for the right people
College Sophomore,5,Its ok but could be better
College Sophomore,5,Drugs are over rated now beer mostly
College Sophomore,5,Sometimes people come and get to know each other more md night its like finiding peopel like yourself
College Sophomore,5,When we have on campus events or greeks throw parties makes college all worth while
College Sophomore,5,I've already goooten my assoaciate degree now returning for my four year looking to groom myself al little more for the work field...
College Sophomore,5,Professors are very skilled in their field so its very helpful when that happens
College Sophomore,5,I enjoyed living on campus! It's definitely a great experience.
College Freshman,5,"Whatever your major is, someone will always be able to provide big help"
College Freshman,5,"In Texas College, you will be showered with great opportunities involving your program"
College Freshman,5,I personally love living off campus. The pros overcome the cons at its best.
College Senior,5,"Texas has the best athletics, best fans, and biggest rivalary"
College Senior,5,The dinning is great off campus. Theres alot of varieties that you can choose from.
College Senior,5,"The diversity is great at Texas College. By everyone coming from diffrent backgounds, thats what keep it interesting."
College Senior,5,I am very happy with the music program here at Texas College. My goal is to be a Music teacher in the publuc school system.
College Senior,5,The weather here in Texas varies from day to day but they never cancell class unless they have to.
College Senior,5,They are very strict here at Texas College. Due to this being a Christian institution they uphold the Core Values of the College. They have all the rules that everyother College or University have but they be sure that the students have a understanding that all rules apply to every student.
College Senior,5,I would say the finicial aid experience is great here at Texas College. They above and beyound to assist me in finding scholarships with the school and help me get some assistance outside the school. They where always kind and never had an attitude towards you. I never left the financial aid office without getting all my questions answered. I recieved a great amount of scholarship to help pay for my education thanks to the finacial aid office.
College Freshman,5,"The thing that seperates my school from other schools is that my school is a Christian school. We have classes such as: Chapel, and Study of the Bible. The scenery of these classes helps enhance your relationship with God and helps you to get to know who he is."
College Freshman,5,"Student life on campus is amazing. I am a student, manager, and a tutor as well. Time management is hard, but for the most part I get everything done. There are many different activities on campus as well as organizations. Student campus living is great."
College Sophomore,5,They stay on top of keeping the drugs and the people with drugs out of school.
College Sophomore,5,"The girls and guys here are very creative when it comes time to expressing themselves physically, mentally, and emotionally. When I first came to Texas College last year it seemed like everyone was bad, but when i got used to everyone and became people friendly i noticed that everyone was different and unique in their own little way."
College Senior,5,there are not many people of different races at TC campus majority are middle to lower class minorites. same religious belifes and sexual orientaion.
College Senior,5,Off campus housing is great to me because they only allow the junior and seniors and 25 and older students live their. Their is no noise at night. You can study with no distractions and everyone gets along with one another really well.
Sophomore,4,Texas College is a love hate relationship while the institution itself has many flaws I love the school because of my peers.
Sophomore,4,"Texas College is a great educational institution. The professors are always willing to go the extra mile to help the students who take school seriously and try their best. To me Texas College has be an great experience for me, it’s challenging but not to hard. The institution just needs to work on communication within the faculty and staff."
Sophomore,4,"I liked that everyone was welcome, it didn’t matter how bad your situation was, they (school and teachers and staff members) will always try to help you. And I think that they should focus more on athletes since their majority of their population is there because of sports"
Freshman,4,"Texas College is an amazing school.  I think it is a good fit for me.  I have met many diverse people and the atmosphere is welcoming.  The professors are attentive and always willing to help.  The dorm and food provided are about average, but the surrounding area has many restaurants to enjoy when I don't want to eat cafeteria food.   I have attended several school functions so far.   One of which was the first football game.  It was interesting, but my team lost.  Ovrtsll, I feel that this experience will be life changing."
Junior,4,"Texas college has been a great experience for me even though it is my first year coming here. The environment is a quite place to focus and study. Everyone is friendly and kind. The campus is nice, a little small but a great place to for study."
Junior,4,"Texas college like any other college is what you make it , come in humble and observant in order to ACTUALLY see what the student and staff body is like. I love that Texas College is a small community cause everybody is known and I feel small towns be the best because everybody can help anybody. What I would like to see change is the old buildings like another gym for us basketball players or better dormitory little things like that"
Junior,4,It’s not hard to meet up with your professor for help with school work. Classrooms are small and intimate so it’s less intimidating
Freshman,4,"i am on the dance team and honestly if it wasn't for that i don't know how my experience at Texas College would be. I've met a lot of friendly people, learned a lot of new thing, reached many goals, and matured  a lot since high school."
Sophomore,4,"The way they handle registration needs some tweaking. It would also be very helpful if they update their technology. Overall being at Texas College feels like another home, once you learn how to get around all the twists and turns it is worth the drive."
Junior,4,I love the students the involvement around the Campus the Professors actually want you to pass.they spend Extra time with their Studnets and there’s al Wya something for studnets to ado around Campus.
Niche User,4,The professors are great with assisting helping with tutoring so that you will be successful.  The campus is very diverse i thought it would only be African American students there until I got on the campus I was amazed at how diverse it is. I would recommend this school to my friends that struggle like me. They are very supportive and ensures all students are successful. I think the cost is high but in the end you get a great education.
Freshman,4,Texas college is a very well good school. They professors are wonderful also the security on the campus is fantastic. I always feel safe. What I would like to see change is gain more school spirit.
Sophomore,4,"I am in my second year of school here and I am very satisfied with the experience. I am in the success program, which is a program for working adults that need to attend school at night. I love the environment that takes place, because there are no games, all work and everyone is on the same page as to trying to graduate. I would highly recommend anyone who is looking to further they're education to come in and check out our campus."
Niche User,4,good college great equipment and wonderful school keep up the work and never give up. ps go to the college to believe what im saying so live life dude
Freshman,4,Texas College is an outstanding school and they have the best sociology classes ever. If you trying to major in sociology Texas College In Tyler Texas is the school to look in to.
College Sophomore,4,I really want to stay off campus
College Sophomore,4,my courses are relly good and i like the way professors teach
College Junior,4,Security Guards are in Place on the campus at all times.
College Junior,4,I don't live on campus but I have heard great  things said from the students.
College Junior,4,"The teachers are the best. I have had some great teachers, They are very patient and don't mind helping you with a topic or subject you don't understand."
College Junior,4,Team performance is real High. The students participate in The  Pep rallys for the Football and Basketball Teams.
College Junior,4,i really enjoyed  my self at the school
College Sophomore,4,Its better to live off campus
Recent Alumnus,4,The school s is great. The quality of education is superb.
College Junior,4,"This college has lots of activities for the students. I love how everyone helps out the student in finding and getting the right classes they need. There is help everywhere, you just have to look for it."
College Sophomore,4,When I went out I loved it!
College Freshman,4,"We have awesome coaches, but not all give out scholarships"
College Freshman,4,"So far, there isn't any visible or notable drug scenes at our school"
College Freshman,4,It's great. There are plenty of other people looking into the same major and we all help each other learn and grow.
College Senior,4,Wish they had more but the campus is still growing
College Sophomore,4,"I fall in Love with Tyler Tx. Its really really a beautiful town to actually live and do your life in here, its very green, tall green trees, the streets are in order, alot of parks, big parks to distract yourself of everything and actually have a good time! I love soccer so, in my case there alot of soccer fields for me to go and play, join in a team and exercise my body and being healthy, i really like this town basically for everything of what i just put."
College Sophomore,4,"Well it does affect us, one time, this one day i was in school walking toward the Financial Aid Building with 2 other of my classmates, it was one of those days that raining was present, thunderstorms and even lighting! So, after doing what i had to do, we now started walking towards the Library Building, befor entering to the Library, theres a parking lot for staf/students, some trees and pole lights with the wire running to different poles and like that, so us walking toward the library, right before like, 30 seconds to enter the library, we saw a lighting literally hitting one of the wire that has the pole light, so us surprising by seeing that, out of no where it started to light up on fire the box the the electricians some times repair, us watching that and now panicking because just the luck that we had, to have our car right in the bottom of what it was happening. Thank God it didnt happen to the extreme but, i always exoect the worse, so it does affect and specially in here Tyler Tx since the weather always surprise me ever day!"
College Sophomore,4,"Is actually fun and entertaining at the same time, since i am learning the things that i need to learn to face it in the real world after i graduated.. its tough no doubt about that but i think that with struggle and hard dedication, you will be allright afterwards."
College Sophomore,4,"Registration are working each semester on it and it really have changed in the way that its way super fast than other semesters, i probably think they are still going to work on it. The special study option well we the soccer program have our own study sessions to not fall behind from our homework and advance in other works that we have."
College Sophomore,4,"Well i am in the soccer program and for me is actually a new experience sinse i had never play college level, its tough, its competetive, iys basically a challenge to yourself just to go ahead and win a position on the 11 starters. The school spirit should definetely have to do something about it, like more promotion for the games, i dont some flyers, announcements on the intercom, something! Because we really need support from our Texas College Steers!"
College Sophomore,4,"Well first of all some of the computers that we have in school, dont work, plus they have a few of them, not that much, they are Dell, good company but, they should upgraded or do something to the software i dont know"
College Senior,4,our drug saftey rule at texas college are very stricked and the take them very seriously. we are in a dry county meaning liquor is not available in tyler city limits its illegal to buy or sell in smith county.
College Sophomore,4,The Life – From what I have heard campus life at Texas College is interesting and they give us opportunity to change what is not
College Junior,4,"We Are One – My school may be small and it may not always look the best, but being at Texas College you will find some of the greatest people you will ever meet. The Professors care about you graduating and they take the time to get to know who you are as person. Peprallies are the best times to get toknow everybody because that when the school spirit comes out of everybody and there are no troubles. It's just pure fun. My school is a Christian College so every Wednesday you are required to go to chapel. I know, sounds boring right? Wrong, there the school gets together and prays and worships together. It may seem a little wierd the first couple of times you go, but the more you go, the more you learn about what the school has to offer because it is there where they give anouncements or have contests for scholarships and so forth. My school is pretty cool and it is full of culture and real ginuwine people."
College Junior,4,"Simply Tyler Texas – Texas College is small and they only have one cafeteria in which its on-campus students are allowed to eat at only certain times of day. Even so the cullinary arts of the chef is not that of high class and when you live off of campus you are required to pay for what I like to call ""High School cafeteria food."" It is located deep into Tyler away from many restaurants such as McDonald's, Subway, Taco Bell, etc. You have to drive at least a mile out just to get to a fast food place, but it is worth it. Because the food at the school is not so great, you want to drive out to a place like McDonald's where their dollar menu helps your college budget and you can load up on lot's of McDoubles and McChickens to take back to campus with you . Subway is not located far away from McDonalds and their 5 dollar foot longs helps when you really want a sndwhich that fills you up. You do waste gas to get to these places, but to get quality food, you have to make a quality drive."
Senior,2,"Texas College has the potential to be a thriving small HBCU. In my four years of being here I have experienced issues with housing and meal plan such as no air conditioning in the dorms and lack of food variety or under cooked meals. However , I've made the best of my time enrolled in Texas College by being a member of the dance team , making life long friends , and taking fully advantage of the minimal scholarship opportunities."
College Sophomore,2,I only have seen one career event.
College Freshman,2,"Many places to live off campus are far, except two apartment complexes that are designated for students."
College Freshman,2,"Not many food options available after 11 because many places close, And not many food places deliver to the dorms, including pizza."
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid does not cover a lot of your cost, so you're guaranteed to have to take out loans and on top of that you still will owe money to the school even after taking out multiple loans. Also the cost of room and board is not worth the amount you pay for it."
College Sophomore,2,When I transfer ill look into that
College Sophomore,2,we have a lot of black out so using the computers are sometime good and bad
College Senior,2,athletics at texas college are great we have a real family  team spritit. but we need more support from family freiends alumni and texas college fans. better facilities will help improve the outcome of the whole athletic department.
College Freshman,2,"Campus Rules – our campus is not to strict ,but thet do have rules.Smoking is one of the top rules at our school. this is a christan based school so our school doesn't really like that image on the school."
College Senior,2,Somewhat Safe – The campus is very small so there isn't much leeway for anyone to really get away with anything. Campus security patrols regularly but they cant catch everything. There are frequent fights but they are between students and are usually handled poorly by security.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not What I Expected – When My Coach recruited me out of high school to play soccer, I was told the Campus was huge and beautiful and we were a very popular school, athletically speaking.  I was told we were a winning team.  My first week at texas College, and everything he said, wasn't true. I forgot to mention the fact that he didn't tel me it was an HBCU, a historically black college or university, not that I'm a racist, but that kind of information shouldn't be withheld."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Sports Are Average – Sports at Texas College are pretty average.  We have facilities that are in need of renovation, we don not have showers or a lockerroom, we do not have a football field, in which our football team has to practice on the baseball field, our soccer field is located off campus in the middle of a neighborhood, our basketball team is the only team that actually wins or gets along with each other.  in other words, texas College is in dire need of help, and renovations."
Freshman,1,"It may seem like this college is a good one from the websites, but I believe this college is anything but good. There's a lot of problems that goes on with this school, I don't advise anyone going here, if you come here, you'll pass with flying colors."
College Sophomore,1,Texas College  just built a new dorm that's pretty nice but there is to many rules that are enforced. You can't have visitors from other dorms visit your room after or before a certain time. No opposite sex is allowed in each others room including a family member. The old dorms will remind you of a jail there is a community shower and bathroom. Very poor quality rooms overall
College Sophomore,1,Our football team is terrible students only go to the game because they nothing else to do. We do not even have our own football stadium we share with a local high school
College Freshman,1,"There are not weekly parties to attend, so when there is a party its very crowded, and fights are always breaking out. A lot of people choose not to go out to avoid the danger from fights and shootings."
College Freshman,1,"Texas College provides students with a poor variety of food. Most of the fruit looks like its been left sitting out for hours or days, does not look fresh at all. A lot of the times the food is cold, or just thrown together."
College Freshman,1,"Texas College provides students with low quality housing, There has been problems with mold in the air vents to the a/c not working for weeks in this Texas heat. Which has resulted in people passing out. Most of the showers are dirty and restrooms are unsanitary. They finally have began the process of building new dorms due to current dorms being in poor conditions."
College Sophomore,1,Its bad you have no protection so anything could happen at any time. Bugs everywhere its just not good at all
College Sophomore,1,I would never come back after i transfer 
College Sophomore,1,Its what you make of it 
College Sophomore,1,Some are good other no so much 
College Sophomore,1,Everything is to far away to eat.
College Senior,1,The financial aid process was a hassle for me I kept getting the run around and was required to apply for more money than i attend that i needed everyone gets charged the same amount no matter how many hours your taking. I suggest that we get charged on the amount of hours we are taking due to the fact some students get charged more than what they are taking
College Senior,1,its always hot in east texas the summer tempature reached 115.  the humidity is high. its always a good idea to stay hydrated with plenty of water
College Junior,1,Needs Help – The athletics are trying to improve but having little success as the football team practices on the baseball feild in season and there is simply not enough space or money.
College Senior,1,Nothing Really Different – Only thing i can think of is that the school is extremely tiny so everyone knows everyone.
College Senior,1,Theres a Van – There is a van for students that comes when the driver feels like it.
College Sophomore,1,"Computer Labs – The computer at Texas College are horrible, majority of the time they don't work."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Most of the time, the computers on campus aren't working, so it's very hard to get work and homework done on time.  The library at Texas College is not a popular hangout, but it's very helpful when it comes to resources and quiet time. We DO NOT have an athletic center, or locker rooms, and being a student athlete, it's not fun, or something that I'm used to."
College Student,1,you have to pay 30 dollas to park or just park off campus and the spots are hard to find
College Student,1,Tc Life – the security is crazy..the college is boring....the tachers are barley there bt i like the school its to high though

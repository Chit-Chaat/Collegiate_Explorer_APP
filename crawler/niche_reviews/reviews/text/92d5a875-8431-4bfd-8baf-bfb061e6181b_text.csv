Sophomore,5,A lot of resources and a very diverse group of students and faculty. I feel motivated to learn from people from different backgrounds!
Sophomore,5,"Very good so far, all professors are trying to adapt and be resourceful during Corona virus times! All the classes are held through zoom."
Junior,5,Professors are very accommodating and easy to work with. Online learning has not changed the level of education I receive.
Niche User,5,I REALLY enjoyed talking to some of the athletic coaches at Columbia. They were kind and very helpful.
Senior,5,"Columbia has offered me an intellectually challenging, academically rigorous environment surrounded my professors who are enthusiastic about their subjects and sincerely invested in their students success.  I transferred in from a peer institution of equal 'academic prestige,' however the difference between the two is notable and I regret not coming to Columbia sooner."
Senior,5,"Though the mode of engagement has changed, 'Zoom' university still provides an academically rigorous environment.  I feel that, in some respects, it has benefited more quiet members of class, in that it takes a lot of the pressure off them when participating in class."
Senior,5,The online ZOOM courses were very accessible. All sessions were recorded so students could go back at any time to review the content that was taught. Professors adapted well to the changes over time.
Alum,5,"Wow, I loved it there! The academics were top notch, and several of my peers are already successful in their careers; the degree as a label has traction in the job market.

As a Veteran who grew up in Minnesota, the weather was mild for me, but those from the South will find the winter challenging.

I found myself very absorbed by my studies at that time, and so did most of the other students. That can make it extremely easy to meet people in an intellectual sense but somewhat difficult to meet in a social sense. My advice is if you want to date, you should learn how to meet people at NYU.

Financial aid is difficult to obtain, but I was a Veteran, and the government paid my tuition, so that was not my struggle."
Junior,5,"I've learned so many new things while at Columbia. Not just academic topics, but really how to navigate this world in a more conscious way."
Niche User,5,It was really great. I could not have had a better experience in this place. It is practically the best college I have ever been to.
Niche User,5,It was really great. I could not have had a better experience in this place. It is practically the best college I have ever been to.
Junior,5,"I have been lucky enough to have had very engaging professors who have driven me to become engrossed in the topics they taught. The workload is very heavy, but the payoff in earning a good grade is totally worth it."
Junior,5,"I love Columbia with all my heart. The professors are very engaged, the campus is its own little island in a highly diverse city full of opportunities, and the student body is brilliant. The culture is very competitive and academic, but that is to be expected, and that is ultimately what motivates me."
Freshman,5,"Columbia is a wonderful school. Beautiful campus on New York's Upper West Side. Really helpful advisement staff and the classes, classmates, and teachers are amazing."
Senior,5,"Columbia University offers many programs that will help further your academic goals. The University is well renown for their business program and engineering programs. If an individual is interested in the Humanities, this is the place for you. There are first class professors that are experts in their field."
Senior,5,Life-changing experience. I absolutely loved my professors and friends. The time I spent here was absolutely incredible.
Senior,5,Columbia was a great experience I hope others could enjoy. campus I. lovely and the food is amazing but the professors were the best part
Alum,5,"Attending Columbia was the best decision I've ever made. Not only are you at a world class institution in the greatest city in the world, you are surrounded by extremely intelligent and hardworking classmates who will inspire you and push you to become the best version of yourself. The opportunities at your fingertips -- both on and off campus -- are limitless. It is not an easy school by any means, but put in the hard work and you will be rewarded in so many ways."
Junior,5,"Columbia University has its title of IVY League school for a reason. The strongest aspects of the school are academia, research, and professors. Due to the COVID-19, everyone had to move the classes to online platforms which led to the loss of the major components of student life. While I love the university deeply if classes will continue holding remotely, I will have to take an academic break."
Junior,5,"A two hour commute into Manhattan can leave one feeling on edge. However, stepping onto the Morningside campus rejuvenates the aspiring scholar. Columbia is stimulating, challenging and awe-inspiring. The financial burden is heavy but scholarships are plentiful and there are few better investments than a top tier education. Parking is surprisingly plentiful on Broadway in the evenings."
Graduate Student,5,"It was an amazing experience, dorms are amazing, everything was amazing. I recommend this school to anyone who gets accepted. I want to go to this school!"
Graduate Student,5,"Columbia is a fantastic University! This school helped me to gain a deep understanding of the international trade framework, broaden my critical skills but also prepared me to become an impactful leader."
Niche User,5,I stayed at columbia for a summer program and loved the atmosphere.  Everyone was open to new things and had amazing personalities.  The buildings are not too modern yet that doesn't bother me. loved it!
Freshman,5,I love how it prepares students not just for their field of study but also for the real-world and the rest of their life.
Graduate Student,5,Amazing school! Excellent tuition and professors! I would always decide to come back. Stephanie Manz-Varga
Niche User,5,This university is perfect in my eyes.  I don't go here yet so I don't really know what I would change yet.
Sophomore,5,"Being in New York is a once in a lifetime opportunity. You have the world at your finger tips. From New York you're simultaneously connected to the beating heart of the US Economy on Wallstreet, to so many firm HQs, as well as the international commerce scene."
Alum,5,"Columbia College is an intellectually rigorous school that places a high demand on the quality of your thinking and work.  Students who attend Columbia are intellectually gifted and worked very hard and earned high grades in order to get accepted by Columbia.  Consequently, you are not only pushed by your professors to do very well, but you are also encouraged by your peers to perform at your highest levels.  The quality of conversations that occur both in lecture style classes and seminars demonstrate a high level of critical thinking.  I was always prepared to participate as I never wanted to appear that I did not know what I was talking about in front of my peers."
Freshman,5,"I've committed to run cross country and track there in the fall. I immediately fell in love with New York City and with the overall atmosphere of the college. Amazing camaraderie, excellent academics, Division 1 sports, and great food!"
Freshman,5,"Columbia is a culturally rich and diverse school with a beautiful campus in one of the most influential cities in the world. The endless amount of opportunities provided here can be overwhelming! There is a place for everyone on this campus, with clubs, sports, and other organizations for every individual."
Niche User,5,i love this university because it is in NYC and i love that place when i go there to visit my aunts and relative. and i want to go to this university to study in computer science
Graduate Student,5,"Columbia University is wholly committed to the academic well-being and personhood of their students inside and outside of studies. Through their active communication and care in students' academic lives, professors are engaged and ready to help their students succeed in their ideological pursuits. Moreover, the Health and Wellness Center approaches health from a holistic perspective, offering mental health services such as therapy sessions, acupuncture, pet therapy day, snacks, and more. Specifically for the Mailman School of Public Health, they require all students to fulfill the Self, Social, and Global Awareness course that evaluates the self and how it fits into societal constructs so that students are prepared to go forth courageously in their social justice work. The Mailman school also invites students to engage in their Grand Rounds where all medical school students share their work and ideas to create a more thought-provoking environment."
Sophomore,5,"For the past two semesters, my experience has been nothing but eye-opening. I came in as a transfer student from Bronx Community College and the transition into a 4-year top tier college was incredible. Columbia is a type of environment with an air of excellence which elevated my mindset into knowing that I am cut out to succeed. Being around the nations' top students is a great motivator to excel beyond my limit and for that, I am more than grateful."
Junior,5,It’s surprisingly down to earth. Everyone really loves what they do and are committed to making their knowledge accessible.
Sophomore,5,"Columbia is rigorous but enjoyable, and it is an ideal place to explore who you are as a person.  With a plethora of classes at your disposal, it’s incredibly easy not only to find classes that excite and challenge you, but also ones the fit into whatever balance of theory/practice, studying/partying, or whatever other trade offs one may be trying to balance."
Graduate Student,5,"Excellent academics and staff.  Beautiful campus and facilities, as well as great school spirit.  I am currently a graduate student and the recognition of Columbia throughout NYC is incredible.   I foresee a great return on investment ahead with the amount of opportunities that I am hopeful will surface."
Alum,5,"I met with very intelligent and interesting people, whom I still admire and get connected with. The curriculum is intense and you'll find yourself spending many nights studying. What you get out is extremely rewarding and you'll see the value of your education in your career. One thing I would change about Columbia is the curriculum. The intensity of each and every course along with the efforts on building a career or graduate school preparation is, in general, more than one can handle. I found myself learning little from some of my courses as I had to rush to complete my projects, tests, and other coursework. For an institution that holds learning as the highest priority, this has to change."
Niche User,5,"Columbia is an amazing university full of brilliant and vibrant students. Inside campus, you feel you are in another world, not in NYC. However, you step out and immerse yourself in the world of opportunities in the Big Apple."
Graduate Student,5,They are quick to reaspond when you have a question.Also the professors are very kind and smart. Everyone  is there to help you succeed!
Sophomore,5,"Columbia offers an unparalleled experience: from living in New York City, to learning from world-class professors, to socializing with students from all across the globe, I wouldn't have been able to gain these memories without this school. While Imposter Syndrome is real for first-generation, low-income students like myself, Columbia has plenty of resources that would otherwise be unavailable to me back at home. Now that I am done with my first year, I realize this is the place I'm meant to be. While it wasn't an easy freshman year, it was a necessary one. I grew and will continue to do so."
Graduate Student,5,"I really feel included as a member of the Columbia family! There are numerous useful resources for you to explore, either student organizations to meet new people, on-campus job opportunities, concern for student safety, etc. I love the university on being clear of the steps of everything you are going to be involved, quick in response, and the people being friendly."
Sophomore,5,"I guess I can't complain about the education, because it is after all an Ivy League, not to say that other universities do not offer an excellent education, but there are good reasons why the Ivy League universities remain prestigious."
Niche User,5,"I loved Columbia! I went there for a college tour and it was absolutely stunning. The professors I met were amazing, and the whole experience was so enjoyable. This is definitely now a college on my radar. Go Lions!"
Freshman,5,Being accepted to Columbia was the best thing that ever happened to me. Every student is palpably ambitious to change the world but still incredibly engaging. The professors are willing to go above and beyond to help you and produce amazing resources.
Alum,5,"Schedule flexibility was main attribute, closely followed by life in New York City! Cross listing to all schools was a major attraction with top notch faculty in every discipline."
Niche User,5,I loved the buildings and the atmosphere they looked really ancient. The library looked beautiful and best part is that it is located in the heart of New York. The professors are wonderful and great at helping students in different tasks.
Freshman,5,"I wouldn't want to be at any other university. Of course, courses are hard, but the overall opportunities and education Columbia provides makes it all worth it."
Graduate Student,5,"Good classes, nice classmates, collaborative environment, good infrastructure, easy to access by bus, metro or walking by"
Freshman,5,"Columbia has changed my life. From the amazing campus, to the variety of classes, to the diversity, I knew I couldn't have made a better choice of university. As a student in seas, I have been invited to countless events with top companies, industry professionals, and leading researchers in STEM. I have visited multiple company offices around the city as well. There are so many opportunities at all times and I haven't been bored since I arrived. The social scene is not bad, and there are plenty of parties every weekend for the interested. The food and housing are pretty good compared to most other colleges. The main thing that Columbia lacks is school spirit when it comes to sports, but to be honest, who cares?"
Graduate Student,5,"Amazing university with great people and academics. Security is great. Wish there was a bit more room though, buildings are quite small."
Niche User,5,"Columbia University is one of the best places to get your higher ED. The campus is in the lively city of New York but provides a real college experience. Columbia is home to rich culture, diversity, and student life."
Graduate Student,5,"I absolutely enjoy being a student at Columbia University. It has excellent faculty, inspiring peers, and a great reputation and alumni network. People here are extremely driven and just walking through campus has an electricity that inspires you."
Niche User,5,"From the several times I've visited and toured the school, Columbia students seem to be very intuitive and creative. Certain groups of students will tend to remain with one another, similar to high school. The campus is amazing: definitely a sight to see."
Niche User,5,"Great homie atmosphere! Very inclusive, and a lot of school support and spirit going around. Abundance amount of resources!"
Senior,5,"A college where they value academics. However, it is definitely not a party school.  The Econ department is one of the toughest."
Niche User,5,"My absolute dream school! Unfortunately it's everyone else's dream school as well. The SAT and GPA requirements are insane – higher than Stanford and Princeton, but I guess if you do the work and get in you get to hob-nob with the best. 

I want to study Computer Science and work in the tech industry. Now that Amazon is going to be in NYC and Google is expanding there too, I feel like Columbia is on a path to be the next Stanford. Please please please let me in Columbia!!!"
Alum,5,"It's Columbia. In my opinion it's the best university in the nation from the perspective of academics, setting and opportunities."
Alum,5,"Columbia University had excellent opportunities to take rigorous, interesting classes, participate in meaningful community service efforts, and take part in a very active culture of positive student extracurricular and social life."
Graduate Student,5,"Ivy League
Smart talent
In New York city
unparalleled opportunities
great network opportunities
best-in-class resources
Beautiful campus"
Niche User,5,"Columbia University is a campus that provides each student with an environment that feels like home. The campus is in New York City, which allows students to have days filled with excitement and return to a campus that is welcoming and relaxing. The campus is small enough to easily be able to walk to all of your classes  and to your dorm, which are extremely satisfying. Dorms range from singles to room mates. Most dorms allow for individual restrooms with no shared stalls and a shared kitchen and lobby per floor."
Junior,4,"Professors are really awesome and give their all to help students. There is always something to do on campus. If you are a freshman I would recommend taking an array of classes and then decide what major you want to pursue.  Don't overwhelm yourself with the classes you take and most importantly don't compare yourself to your classmates. Everyone's circumstances are  different. There is a lot of academic help and tutoring available on  campus, don't think that you are the only one not understanding the topic."
Niche User,4,"I did not have any online learning at Columbia University, but I am sure that it would be an easy and fun learning experience. The professors truly care and seem like such great people."
Senior,4,"I also took online courses last semester because of the pandemic. From what I’ve heard from other students, virtual learning is a terrible inconvenience. There is little to no motivation from both students and Professors. 90% of the appeal is being able to chat with professors and fellow classmates to brainstorm together and collaborate/hash out ideas on topics in class. Without that it becomes very  difficult since you’re constantly hitting mental blocks."
Senior,4,"I love Columbia. It’s really the students who make the experience. I’ve met some of the most intelligent, high achieving, self motivated individuals. It’s creates an aspiring ambience on campus which influences you to work harder and aim higher. Someone is always willing to help you out, whether it’s with academics/networking. Columbia has a great community. However, I do wish that facilities were more updated...especially the engineering facilities. I also wish that the curriculums would be more up to date with a bit of emphasis on applications (most courses tend to be theoretical)."
Junior,4,Professors seem to be really trying to make learning a positive experience for students.  We are able to engage with classmates through Zoom.
Junior,4,"Students are all kind and friendly! Teaching could be improved somewhat, but I have definitely had some incredible professors at the University!"
Senior,4,"Columbia University is located at the heart of Manhattan in NYC, on the Morningside Heights neighbordhood. 

Academics can be a toin coss, as you can get professors who don't teach very well and you spend your study time teaching the content to yourself. On the other hand, some professors really care about their students and go beyond to ensure their success."
Graduate Student,4,I really like the events hosted by University Life.  I am learning so much from faculty and I am really thankful to them for where I am now in terms of my educational experience.
Graduate Student,4,"I have taken both online and residential classes. Online classes use a program called Adobe Connect which works well and is much better than what remote classes are using now, Zoom."
Junior,4,"Columbia has an incredible student body and no shortage of opportunities to take advantage of.  The social culture can be difficult to handle at time and very stressful.  Courses are difficult and not all professors are the best, but the TA program is very strong and many professors do care deeply about the students and their experience.  Columbia has many resources and makes it easy to find opportunities in the city and for the summer."
Junior,4,"Columbia clearly has been doing everything they can to make the online learning environment fair for every student and I strongly supported their decision to go to P/F for equal opportunity.  Their handling of the return to school has been difficult to navigate, but understandable.  Professors in the spring semester were willing to compromise and understand student's situations; however, little was done by the university at the time to promote student life or stay connected to the university."
Niche User,4,"I have toured this university two times and I am so surprised to see the faculty and the facility, revealing a different aspect of New York."
Alum,4,Online learning was not an issue for me; it was only rarely used by the professors. For the most part we were in-class.
Freshman,4,"Despite my worries about the sudden change to online learning due to COVID-19, the professors handled it extremely well and tried their best to engage the students and not overstress them."
Freshman,4,"Columbia is known for being at ""the heart of NYC,"" but what I find more attractive about it is the beauty of the campus itself and the rigorous academics."
Alum,4,"During COVID-19, all classes transitioned to online. Luckily, most of my classes were large lectures, making it easy for the professor to lecture at the camera with limited student interaction. I am sure it would have been more difficult if I was in a smaller discussion based seminar. Professors were pretty understanding of all students situations, and always asked the students at the beginning of classes about their days, and how they and their families were doing in general given everything going on."
Alum,4,"I am grateful for my time at Columbia because I learned a lot in the class. I learned how to think and question the world around me. Most students enjoy having philosophical conversations about the texts we are all required to read. Even though it can be a bit pretentious sometimes, it is really cool how eager people are to learn, and the passion they have for the new ideas they have learned. That being said, a lot of people are obnoxious about their intelligence. Students are pretty also pretty obnoxious when it comes to being super PC."
Niche User,4,I personally believe that Columbia University is a place of opportunity because not only are you in a city that is riddled with internships and potential jobs with endless connections you are also attending classes with renown professors as well as a diverse student body.
Niche User,4,"I spent the summer there for a pre-college program. It was, in short words, an illuminating experience. I wasn't just learning. I was doing so much more. I was meeting friends from all around the world. I was making life long friends. I was being motivated by my teachers and peers. The university area is far away from the bustle of Time's Square, but close enough to walk/ take a train. The food... I could write essays about the food. It was a surreal experience for me. I was truly challenged and brought into a safe space for me. I will forever be grateful. (Only thing is that it's very!!!! Expensive!!!!)"
Sophomore,4,"Columbia University is academically challenging. It is inspiring to be surrounded by a rich history in the City, and to be able to learn from the very researchers writing the very papers you find interesting."
Junior,4,As I transferred from Community College to Columbia I did not know what to expect besides the obvious rigorous academics. But I can say that it has been a positive experience. The professors are very helpful and extremely knowledgeable.
Junior,4,Food is great! Great university to connect with people and companies. Location is amazing. You really feel the New York City vibes while being here. Easy ways to escape life when needed.
Niche User,4,"Columbia University is placed in a beautiful city, and has many opportunities for students to grow and find career opportunities."
Niche User,4,It's known as one of the best places to learn and become someone.. I know I am 58 years late. but I have dreamed of attending that school. Never had the means growing up..Living a very hard life...I want to try it now!
Junior,4,"Columbia is in the ideal location if you like cities and culture. However, the campus is sometimes referred to as a bubble as it’s easy with all the work to forgot to explore the amazing places around you. Classes can be very challenging and not all professors are amazing but I don’t have experience at another college to compare it to."
Graduate Student,4,Planning to enroll in Columbia University in August 2019 for the program of Business Analytics in the IEOR Department.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the location in New York and the campus itself. It is very beautiful and comes alive when the sun comes out, especially. There are a lot of events always happening and the people attending are very diverse, but what can be improved is the diversity shown in academics and the Core. The Core is the required classes all students must take---most of them are very West-centered with Western thinking prioritized. However, with the diverse student body, the Core needs to become more diverse and reflect the diversity of the school. Right now, the academics prioritize Western, white men and that needs to be changed. The systematic racism also needs to be addressed better, as is a common issue with almost every school, especially the Ivies."
Alum,4,"I loved Columbia, and don't regret my decision to attend, but it's a very specific school. Being in New York is incredibly unique, and you won't get the typical college experience if you choose Columbia. For some, this is a drawback, but for people interested in living in the city and who are more independent, Columbia is great. Many people fall into the trap of the grind - working all the time - and it's an academically demanding school, but if you prioritize your time you'll have plenty of hours free to explore the city and relax."
Graduate Student,4,"Columbia is a wonderful, historical institution that fosters creative thinking and education. Here, I have access to some of the greatest minds of our time. My professors are all very accessible and have so much knowledge and experience to share. The only downside is the bureaucracy and how long it takes to get anything administratively done."
Graduate Student,4,Would highly recommend to all! It was a terrific experience that I wish I could relive. There were many highlights over my time at Columbia and those considering the school should not look any further.
Sophomore,4,"Columbia has great academics, but their social life isn't the best. We have great free events and connections to NY activities, but with so much school work, it's hard to get out and do it all."
Senior,4,"Columbia University is a quality academic institution which blends the focus of a small campus and the high energy of a big city. Classes can be challenging depending on workload but the ability to build connections with academics and researchers leading their field is top tier. The opportunity for networking that Columbia offers is one of its biggest pros. The student body is relatively diverse and there are many clubs and organizations for minority demographics and interests. Campus provides a quiet space for those concentrating on their studies while still being a quick ride to the entirety of New York City. The university still has to improve the quality of housing and perhaps safety, but for those who want to experience quality education in an exciting urban setting, this institution is a good choice."
Senior,4,"I love Columbia's Campus. It has a college campus field, while being close to the city.  Many things (shopping, restaurants, parks) are close and do not take too long to get to.  I was on the Columbia University Women's Soccer team, and this 4 year experience was one of the best, if not the best, experiences of my life.  The team chemistry was great.  The faculty is also great.  At first, the sciences were shaky due to the fact that this is a research university and those who perform research must teach; however, when I started to take classes focused on my major (Biomedical Engineering).  I loved (almost) every class, and felt that that was the educational experience I deserved at Columbia."
Sophomore,4,I love the academic challenges the school has each student face. I love the location of the school on the Upper West Side since it’s a little bit more calm but you can still go downtown if you want more people/noise/activities. The dorms and housing options are amazing and all are relatively close to campus. I just wish there was more of a connection between the student body as a whole maybe at athletics or some event.
Alum,4,"The diversity was great, the class sizes were perfect, the core - while time-consuming was beneficial and made for a well-rounded education, and the people I met were the very best part."
Junior,4,"Columbia University was my dream school and it has lived up to my expectations. The education is unparalleled and I have made lifelong friends. Also, the school has great resources and it is located in the best city in the world."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have had a fantastic experience at Columbia. It was a bit of a shock moving to New York, but after a year of going to Columbia, I can say that I am just about fully adjusted to living on my own in the big city. The only negative I have experienced at Columbia is getting used to the socioeconomic differences, with myself coming from lower income and most of my peers coming from high income families."
Junior,4,I really love the location and the campus. Being in the heart of NYC is incredible and there are so many opportunities that come with being a student here. I've also had a great experience with my teachers and classes.
Junior,4,"I feel as though it is difficult to tap into all of the university's resources as a first generation, low income student. I think if this community had more visibility on campus, it would be easier for me to benefit from all the networks and opportunities Columbia has to offer."
Graduate Student,4,Columbia is in NYC and is the perfect place to connect with a wide variety of people who care about issues similar to yours.
Sophomore,4,"Columbia is known for it's academic rigor and it's well rounded education. The work load is incredibly heavy and you need to be prepared to make a lot of sacrifices if a student would like to attend Columbia. The biggest struggle of Columbia is having the skills to maintain good study habits and handle the extreme stress levels that come with being a student there. The school does what they can to aid in managing your course load, but at the end of the day it's mostly up to you. There's a unique level of independence for the students and succeeding at Columbia means you need to be able to teach yourself a lot of the material and keeping up on your own."
Sophomore,4,"I have had a wonderful time at Columbia University. The students here are extremely friendly and always willing to help each other out. I am particularly happy I chose this university because of our core curriculum. I have taken courses in philosophy, literature, and African history because of our core curriculum. I am convinced that I will leave this institution as a well-rounded individual. Lastly, this university has opened many doors for me as I have had the opportunity to network with top companies and learn skills that I know will benefit me in the workforce."
Alum,4,"The people were great at Columbia and I had a great experience. However, I sometimes got the sense that the administration didn't really care about students and it could feel disaffecting."
Alum,4,"Columbia is a high-stress environment, and that works for the people who go there. While there's a ""we're all in this together"" vibe, it would help if the administration gave off the aura of caring about students a little more. We aren't just investments—we're people, too."
Niche User,4,"it's quite nice, the campus I think is one of the best in New York. I would highly recommend going to this university. the teachers care about their students."
Freshman,4,"As with other colleges, Columbia was something I needed to adjust to. What Columbia has that other colleges may not, is an amazing support system to make sure students transition into i]their new lives as smoothly as possible."
Freshman,4,"This college may be one of the best, but as always, it is the students here that make it the school that it is. Everyone here is pretty motivated and aiming to do well. The atmosphere is quite stressful as the workload is heavy. In the Engineering school, students have to take 5 classes every semester just to get the requirements finished, unlike some other colleges/universities where 4 classes are enough. Some professors are better than others, but that goes for every school."
Junior,4,"The location is very nice, because it is in the middle of New York. You are situated on the upper west side, which means you are just a subway ride away from anywhere you want in New York. It is also one of the safest campuses in the country. The dining halls are very highly rated as well, and you are on a dining plan all four years, so it works out very well. The on-campus housing is also very good, especially due to the fact that it is near impossible to find off-campus housing. Overall, the school is very good in terms of its location and accommodations. The student life is pretty good, but could use some work in terms of being less intense."
Junior,4,"To me, Columbia University is a top-tier university with incredible educational opportunities. At times, it can be tough to stay afloat in the deep stress culture present on campus, as well as maneuver the majority wealthy student body. However, the education, the resources, the surrounding communities, and the amazingly talented students themselves contribute to a unique experience that few other universities have to offer."
Junior,4,"An excellent university, but the rigor can be quiet a turnoff. It's also centered in a busy high-traffic area next to a hospital, so sirens are more common than the sound of birds."
Junior,4,"The Ivy League brand is a leg up in the job market. Resources are great, education is solid. Professors vary, but are mostly good."
Graduate Student,4,"Love the classes and professors. If you're looking for the classic college experience though, this is not the school for you. You're living in New York City and you won't get the feel or experience of a college town."
Graduate Student,4,"I am currently enrolled in graduate school at the prestigious Columbia University. I am impressed with the level of diversity at Columbia. There is a majority minority. Most of my seminars are comprised of Asian, Indian students I myself am typically the only African American student. I believe that Columbia truly wants their students to thrive. They bring in some of the best professors from the corporate world. For instances in one of my courses I have three different professors. Each have a very different perspective and method of teaching. I will say that I am disappointed that there are not more scholarships available to graduate students; I am working a full-time job in addition to taking a full course load so that I can graduate in a two year span and pay for school. Mind you I have a 3.8 G.P.A I believe that their should be some source of funding other than loans for students in my situation."
Freshman,4,Columbia is great. I have loved my experience here and couldn't recommend this school any more highly.
Alum,4,"Columbia is top notch in almost every category.  But, recently the administration censored the famously clever marching band by canceling its traditional ""Orgo Night"" show in the library on the eve of finals week.  Suddenly, after 40 years, the show as no longer ""appropriate.""  Heavy-handed administrators who suppress student speech rights don't seem to be in keeping with what Columbia is supposed to stand for."
College Sophomore,4,"It's not easy being a genderqueer bisexual female bodied latinx. Campus is diverse, acceptance is... better than most. The school and the student body leaders make an effort to improve it."
College Sophomore,4,"The brand name itself opens doors wherever I go. However, Columbia is one of few schools in the city that doesn't let students tale internships for credit, which disqualifies all of its students from many prestigious and worthwhile internships."
College Sophomore,4,"Round 1 at Columbia things were a disaster in this department. Was during the highly publicized mattress piece, and many many many protests about the school's mishandling of sexual assault. When I returned, however, they really, really seemed to have listened to the activist community, to the students, and made a lot of significant changes, both in mandatory student workshops and education and in public resources."
College Sophomore,4,"I've been in and out of Columbia, but it really in a unique school, being ivy league full of hyperintelligent high achievers without feeling like a machine made to churn out sociopathic moneymakers. It loves the arts and it loves rebellion. Students are PASSIONATE and they won't just show off for a class -- so many people choose to start businesses, hold protests, make differences, make art, do whatever it is they love. I currently am CEO of 2 companies I founded -- a webzine for genderqueer issues and a clothing line. Only thing is I wish that it could be more relaxed. When I was a freshman, it felt competitive and uncomfortable for me, like students didn't want to learn as much s they just wanted to be impressive, so I dropped out and transferred to Pratt with a massive scholarship. I returned a few years later in the school of General Studies, which is way more flexible and easygoing, especially when it comes to the core curriculum. I think the rest of Columbia should gradually make its way towards operating more like GS."
College Junior,4,"Housing is expensive, but still much cheaper than renting a place off-campus. I loved living in Furnald even though it's known to be the ""anti-social dorm"". It's beautiful for one, and a very peaceful place to live."
Senior,2,"professors can be a hit or miss, the hits are truly amazing and can make your overall experience worthwhile"
Junior,2,"it's dog-eat-dog. Many of the students offer performative support to others, which matches their performative activism. It's a lot, but not in a good way."
Junior,2,"There are far too many students at Columbia, preventing the students and the faculty from having meaningful relationships. There is very little individualized attention. Many professors might be great scientists but are terrible lecturers and cannot teach."
Niche User,2,"I really enjoyed the fact that Columbia keeps their students on core curriculum for two years to build community. However, it made me very upset that the majority of the literature in their core curriculum is written by white straight men. I think that in our modern day society it is important to teach literature not only written by white men, but literature that is created by women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community."
College Sophomore,2,"Columbia has a toxic environment, both due to the competitive nature between students and also because of the administration's lack of compassion for its students. There's a reason Columbia is considered one of the most depressing schools in the country."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm by no means an athlete, but even I wish the facilities were better. A combination of not having the space for adequate athletic facilities in Morningside Heights and general malaise for anything that makes student life better on the part of the administration contribute to the lackluster facilities. The teams are mostly not great, but athletes work hard, and if you really want to, you can be involved."
College Freshman,2,"The school is extremely bad at most sports.  One sport that we excel in is fencing, but almost nobody watches that.  Columbia did win a basketball championship as well. And baseball is great too. But our football is among the worst in the country.  Almost nobody attends the sports games, either."
College Freshman,2,"We are not good at sports. That is not why we come here. But, if you pay attention, and don't believe in the stereotypes, they're awesome."
Recent Alumnus,2,I wasn't interested and didn't pay much attention and that wasn't a unique attitude on campus.
College Freshman,2,The campus and staff don't seem to do anything specifically to address the issue of campus rape.
College Freshman,2,The administration does not seem to care at all about undergrads making it seem like an environment of people who are only around for obtaining a diploma.
College Freshman,2,Even if the team is good and/or successful almost no one on campus will care about them or go to any of the events.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Most of the companies that showed up for events were interested in market themselves, not recruit. If you are an international student, it is very, very hard to get an internship. Me and a friend applied for some 80 internship positions last Spring We had no answers at all."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Columbia, pretty much like the other Ivy universities doesn't care about getting athlete students to make consistent sport teams. Not a problem to me. Sports facilities were OK, pool was closed during the whole summer though. Even being a summer researcher, they made me pay to use the facilities during that period."
College Freshman,2,"As a man, I feel incredibly safe walking just about anywhere on campus (and in the city). However, I don't like letting female friends walk home alone, just out of concern for safety, especially if the dorm is off-campus. Campus police are noticeably present, however, which helps."
Recent Alumnus,2,NYC housing sucks and it always will.
Recent Alumnus,2,There's nothing in the area. You have to travel somewhere for it to really be worth it.
Recent Alumnus,2,Only speaking for the medical campus. There isn't a lot of diversity.
Recent Alumnus,2,I'm only speaking for the Public Health administration. It's very disorganized and sometimes they are quite rude.
Recent Alumnus,2,They don't give enough aid and you have to fight them to increase work study stipends.
Recent Alumnus,2,Columbia does not provide much support to grad students. I am attempting to secure funding from other sources.
College Junior,2,New York is VERY expensive and as a graduate student the only option is off campus housing...
College Sophomore,2,"I can only speak for graduate housing, but it is a lottery system and your lucky if you get it. My friend last year was unable to get housing but was lucky to find people who needed a roommate one month before school started. Otherwise your stuck trying to find something around the area and city living can get expensive, especially if you're on your own. Just cross your fingers when you apply but look for a back-up in case."
College Junior,2,"New Englander sports we can do: rowing, sailing,"
College Junior,2,New York housing is way too expensive.
College Junior,2,"Financial Aid is extremely difficult to get for a family with average income and assets.  The application does not ask what hardships a family has taken or how secure your current income is. A home should not be taken as wealth, this is the place you live in."
College Sophomore,2,Students focus on academics and not sports.
College Sophomore,2,City parking is limited. Most students do no have cars. Mass transit is available.
College Sophomore,2,"If you share an apartment with more than three others then it can be affordable, and by that I mean roughly on-par with on-campus housing. Not much money is saved for the added inconvenience."
College Sophomore,2,"Tthe few teams with notable success nationally are fencing, archery, and basketball. The homecoming football game is a tradition but aside from that no one attends the events because the stadium is out of the way, the campus is small, and the football team is consistently horrible."
College Junior,2,Medical campus is located in a less than ideal neighborhood and facilities do not have aesthetic appeal.
College Junior,2,"The RA's and Public Safety officers do their best not to get you in trouble. However, once you are in trouble, the Columbia administration shows no mercy-ever."
College Senior,2,"From what I've seen and heard, Greek life is what you make of it. Some dorms located in close proximity to fraternity/sorority brownstones suffer from obnoxiously high (usually party-related) noise levels on weekends; otherwise, the Greek presence is easy to find or ignore as desired."
College Senior,2,"The financial aid office is a scary place.  The process as a whole is ok, the people are nice,  but trying to understand the statement they send is a little mystifying.  I've had to ask several times what certain items are and how they have calculated them.  They are slow to respond, but eventually get around to it.  You just need to stay on top of it all."
College Freshman,2,"Not many people do it, its not the typical scene. And any and every body can get into a greek organization if they want, its too easy."
College Junior,2,"Columbia University is not known for its athletic programs. While that is not to say there are not successful sports teams the truth of the matter is that Columbia has little school spirit. Most sporting  events, with the occasional exception of a basketball game, pass by unnoticed by the student body a problem that is compounded by the football team's lack of success."
Recent Alumnus,2,Greek life isn't big at Columbia. Very small minority of students are greek. It has a pretty limited effect of campus life aside from the big rager parties.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life definitely exists. Many fraternities and sororities have their own brownstones and hold weekend parties and events as well as other types of societies and communities. However there is Columbia is not known for Greek life because it doesn't consume the lives of the students who are part of these communities, but is there when you want it."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I know that Columbia has organized sports teams because it is part of the Ivy League...but what they are exactly I couldn't tell you. For me having a sports-centric college experience wasn't important, so I don't mind the fact that they aren't super-abundant on campus. It's New York City, so going to the game on weekends isn't really routine for a lot of people. I gave Columbia a C because their actual athletic facility is terrible and a complete ripoff. Doesn't have lockers that are free-of-charge for people to use. Also because intramurals are limited and most sports classes that are offered are for-credit only."
College Sophomore,2,"New York City is the most overrated place in the world. There is nothing to do if you are not 21, unless you're actually interested in all the bulls*** museums and art displays that are all the same."
Graduate Student,1,"The Executive Masters in Public Administration (at SIPA) is terrible. Although it's supposed to be an executive program (for people with full-time jobs), registration for classes is available only a week before the semester starts, and the program/school has no regard for people that are unable to change their work schedules with a week's notice. The program itself does not offer a large variety of classes, and oftentimes students are left to take classes from other schools or program, and this means that they never have priority registration. Additionally, one of the required classes (Quantitative Techniques/Statistics) is only taught on Saturdays from 3-5PM followed by lab from 5-7PM, despite numerous complaints from everyone in the program. Waitlists for some classes are insane and new sections of the same class are not opened to meet demand."
Junior,1,"The people are stuck up

No parking 

No athletic ability among students

Professors are difficult 

Tuition is very expensive, not particularly because the education is better, but because it's an Ivy

You're buying a name, not an education"
College Sophomore,1,"Nobody cares about them, typically players/coaches aren't very good, and the facilities are subpar."
College Junior,1,I've no idea about anything that happens at Columbia University concerning Greek Life
College Freshman,1,"No one cares about football, and while other sports have their specific followings, there's really not a single sport that unites the school. Sports really aren't that big of a deal at Columbia."
College Junior,1,Took away my grant halfway through Freshman year.
College Sophomore,1,Choosing Columbia if you care about school sports in any fashion is a terrible idea. However you have plenty of professional sports in NYC
Recent Alumnus,1,There was no scholarship or aid opportunity other than FAFSA for the program I am in.
Recent Alumnus,1,I would have liked and probably taken part in a dining plan for summer students.
College Sophomore,1,Not worn your time not worth your time not worth your time
College Sophomore,1,"No one parks here. If you commute, you take the public transportation. Parking lots are absurd if you're staying for longer than a day."
College Sophomore,1,"As a member of the cheerleading squad, I witness just how poor the school spirit is weekly. The basketball games are well-attended (meaning people actually show up) but football always has more parents or alumnae than students watching the game. Because the school is so academically focused, athletes are looked down upon as only getting in due to their athletic capabilities and not because of their academic intelligence."
College Freshman,1,"It's New York City. You should leave the car at home, you absolutely will not need it. There is no parking provided by the university, so you're stuck to parking on the street. "
College Sophomore,1,"At least in the law school, and this isn't fairly uncommon, scholarships are hard to come by. You either get them when you are admitted or you don't get them at all. There are also very few of them to begin with."
College Sophomore,1,"Words can't describe the amount of vitriol students have for Columbia athletics. Personally, I find it tasteless; as much as Columbia students like to express their tolerance for all walks of life, they're unrelentingly critical of those who find a passion in sports."
College Junior,1,"New York City is definitely not a place that welcomes car owners. There is absolutely no need to have a car in the city. If you do decide to have a car, expect to pay a second rent just to park and maintain the car."
College Sophomore,1,"There are athletics at Columbia?

If you like gigantic, overcrowded gyms, Columbia's Dodge Fitness Center is the place for you..."
College Freshman,1,"It gets very, very cold here. Walkways become slippery and it can sometimes be hard walking to classes if you don't have shoes with grip. Also, the buildings act like wind tunnels and if you don't have the right gear you will freeze. When it isn't freezing, such as the summer months, it is very hot! and if you don't have AC or a fan in your room it turns into a sauna. The only upside is the cool fall and spring months."
College Freshman,1,"Living in New York, university housing is undoubtably the best possible options for students in terms of convenience and especially cost. There are university owned apartments available outside the main morningside heights campus, however, I don't know anyone who would spend the outrageous amount of money on non University housing in New York."
College Sophomore,1,"Not only do they not offer a huge variety of majors, programs and courses, but the classes they do offer are way harder than they should be. It's like every professor at the college has this undying need to make every subject 10 times harder than it should be and add tons of material that isn't in the textbook. They try to trick you on exams and add information to the exams that they did not teach in lecture. I honestly do not understand how anyone can maintain a 3.0. And forget it if you are an athlete...the professors and students will automatically all hate you."
College Sophomore,1,"The school makes no attempt to provide info on off campus housing. Also, being in NYC, it is extremely expensive and no one really does it...ever."
College Freshman,1,"Parking gets an F, but really it's not a concern for students since nobody has a car (it's New York, I mean seriously). Public transportation (subway and buses) is efficient and the first choice of pretty much everyone on campus. It can get pricey if you need to use it a lot for something off campus - like volunteering or a job - but some off-campus opportunities may cover the cost of transportation. If you're destination isn't very far, walking is a good, free option, too. If you insist on having a car, you're just making trouble for yourself."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Cars are unnecessary and often a burden in New York City.  In the ten years I lived there, I believe I only knew one person who had a car.  I certainly never met a student with a car - it's just not a car-culture-city.  There is no parking on campus and while there is street parking in the surrounding area, it can be incredibly difficult and frustrating to snag!"
College Freshman,1,"It's NYC – Really, you don't need a car. Student parking doesn't really exist in NYC. Public transit or just walking is the way to go!"
College Senior,1,"Students can choose to take their chances on the street, but risk being towed or they can pay an obscene amount of money for a parking garage."
College Junior,1,"I was initially excited to attend Columbia because of its location and ostensible academic reputation.  However, this tiny ugly little school which borders a very bad neighborhood in New York City has proven to be such a disappointment, I'm transferring out my senior year.   I've had to many classes which are graded by T.A.'s that are completely unfamiliar with the material, to the point they actually look to students for the answers.  Most of my classes exceed 100 students making the instructors completely inaccessible.  Nobody gives a damn, especially the administration which is as corrupt as they get.  Columbia is all about getting your money, and ripping you off with an inferior product.  Worst of all, the campus is down right unsafe.  Harassment seems to be the most common crime, but unless it is sexual harassment, the school will do absolutely nothing.  As a student harassed by another student, I had to get a lawyer to resolve the issue, because the dean of Columbia College refused to follow his own rules as delineated in F.A.C.I.T.S., Columbia's policy guidebook given to all students.  It is completely unacceptable that Columbia's unwillingness to do anything contributed to an atmosphere in which learning was impossible.  This shameful excuse of a school is a national disgrace.  You can obtain a far superior education at a fraction of the cost at your local community college.  I can't wait to leave this dump!"
College Senior,1,"Not Equally Distributed – Financial Aid depends upon the college you attend at Columbia.  It is definitely NOT distributed equally amongst the schools.  A General Studies student pays far more to attend than a Columbia College student. This is because CC has a rule if you parents make under a certain amount, you get a free ride.  Not so at GS.  Financial services are also very slow to respond with scholarship, grant, and aid information.  I had until Spring of 2012 before my Fall of 2011 awards were posted.  Meanwhile, my record showed a hold on my account, preventing me from registering.  This happened to hundreds of students.  It was pure hell!"
College Senior,1,"The administration turns their back to illegal drug and alcohol use even when reported.  I know; I reported a CC student and nothing happened.  In fact I was threatened if I filed a police report.  However, if drugs are brought to the attention of the media, the school will act.   In December of 2010, some students were busted for selling drugs by an NYPD sting.  The story made the headlines in NYC.  The school expelled the students, even though what they were doing was nothing compared to other students who were reported to the administration and campus security.  Columbia is extremely hypocritical."
College Senior,1,"Terrible parking situation.  No Columbia lots, but there are garages which can run $50-75 dollars per day. HORRIBLE.  Columbia offers no parking of its own."
College Senior,1,"Not So Great – Like most things at Columbia, the Greek life is lame."
College Senior,1,"Like most things at Columbia, athletics suck.  The underground gym is a disgrace."
College Senior,1,"Dirty, Dangerous, Ugly – Columbia has a very tiny campus that boarders on a dangerous neighborhood.  Most buildings are covered in soot, and just appear very dirty. The campus has hedges around everything which literally shout ""keep off.""  The interior of buildings vary O.k. to disgusting.  In all, the school is i poor shape.  You would think an Ivy League University with this kind of endowment would do much better.  This is why Columbia is the ugliest, dirtiest and most dangerous of all the Ivy League schools.  Shameful."
College Freshman,1,"What A Joke – If you even thought about needing a car, you should be checked by a doctor. This is NYC!"
College Freshman,1,"They Suck – School spirit is non existant, especially as athletes usually are kids with 2.5 gpas who Penn wouldn't take but we did for our terrible teams.  They don't train that often, and get all sorts of special treatment. hate them."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The financial aid department is truly a nightmare.  Scholarship monies that were supposed to be credited to accounts due to adjustments in course credits never materialized.  Resultantly, holds were placed on student accounts, disallowing students to register for classes.  The issue took over one year to resolve.  Moreover, students were forced to pay late registration fees o $150 because of Columbia's error.  Students at The School of General Studies DO NOT have the same access to financial aid as those of Columbia College, even though their need is greater.  It's time to merge the two schools two stop this systemic financial discrimination directed a segment of the student population.  Shameful indeed."
College Freshman,1,"Of course, the nightlife in NYC is amazing... and you can go with a few people downtown and have an awesome time but you really don't get a sense of community at Columbia. The same exact few people go to a bar called Mels on Columbia campus every single thursday friday and saturday night. It gets really, really, REALLY, boring after a while and there is no change in pace. The frats and sororities are very exclusive so when they actually do throw a party, which never happens, it is usually at the only bar people go to so everyone's night is ruined because they can't get into the bar. Everyone is off doing their own thing and the students really are not inviting. "
College Junior,1,"there isn't a designated parking lot for students or faculty, therefore being located in NYC, across from a major hospital makes finding parking a nightmare. Aside from this problem there are also many areas where parking is strictly with parking meters."
Recent Alumnus,1,You're best off going with on-campus housing because finding an apartment in NYC is so difficult and expensive and often involves brokers.
College Freshman,1,"If You Have to Read This, You Should Visit the School – Columbia is in the middle of NYC. No one and I mean NO ONE drives."
College Senior,1,"VERY EXPENSIVE – Very expensive.  Difficult to find anything below $800/mo.  I did manage to find something cheaper, but it's a real dump and I can't wait to move out!"

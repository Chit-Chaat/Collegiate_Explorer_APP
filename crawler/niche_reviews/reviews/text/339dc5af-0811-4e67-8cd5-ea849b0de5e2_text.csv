Sophomore,5,I have all online classes due to the pandemic right now. The professors are very helpful and understanding. They work with their students to provide the best education they possibly can.
Sophomore,5,"I am a second-year at Northeastern Illinois University. I like everything about Northeastern Illinois University; tuitions and fees are reasonable, diverse, safe, and etc. I really don't want NEIU to change besides them to have science or medical programs that science students can get into. I would never want to transfer to other university if they had science or medical programs. This university is just too good that I can't and don't want to transfer."
Sophomore,5,"When I was in high school people would ask “What school do you see yourself
attending?”, and my response was always “somewhere in New York”. I'll admit NEIU wasn't my first choice for college but after attending school here for an academic year I’ve grown to love this school. The faculty at NEIU are very nice and supportive. The people and students are always encouraging us to get involve on campus and in the community. NEIU has taught me to take life day by day, learn how to take some losses, don't give up and if you miss an opportunity there will be plenty of more in due time.

Junior,5,"I choose northeastern for my degree, because neiu staff and Professors are really helpful. I would suggest others to come to neiu."
Junior,5,"What I like about NEIU is how the staff, especially the financial aid department, is hands on and want to help. My last college, which I received my associates degree, was not as hands on. I would like the lunch room to improve, the food is not very good and theirs not many options."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience has went well. Due to COVID-19 and the shut down to schools, classes have been transferred online which means I have taken classes online. As classes were online professors/instructors enhanced learning and communication for any class type by using that was convenient for us like google hangouts which is automatically connected to our emails."
Alum,5,"Professors were great and passionate about what they teach. NEIU was very welcoming and the H&PE club was great to be part of.

Its affordable, especially in relation to other universities nearby. It's also in Chicago which offers many job , internship and career opportunities."
Sophomore,5,"As a freemover international student, I was made to feel super welcome. The courses in the departments I attended were challenging but rewarding. Lots of non-traditional students, lots of people from all around the world and all walks of life. An enriching atmosphere if you seek a non-traditional college experience. The campus is nice, parking is ok. I can't talk about housing or food since I didn't use either service."

My educational aspirations consist of acquiring a bachelor's degree with a major in psychology and a minor in biology which would assist me in my career as a neonatal nurse. Northeastern does not provide a degree for nursing but they had lovely people who were able to guide me with prenursing courses. From the very beginning at NEIU, I felt relieved that they were able to set me up with a timeline of courses I could take that will count towards pre-nursing prerequisites."
Sophomore,5,This college is amazing the classes are scheduled in such a way where it fits with whatever you want. The staff here are excellent and are always helpful. The professors here are dedicated to your academics showing genuine interest in the class they teach.
Graduate Student,5,"I love the one on one attention you receive from professors. The graduate program in Communication, Media and Theatre, should to be narrowed down in terms of being able to concentrate on one area of study as oppose to all three."
Senior,5,I love NEIU because it's a small school and it had the majors that I want to study and pursued my degree on.
Senior,5,"The employees at NEIU are very helpful and genuinely care about the student’s success and well-being. There are many safety social nets to protect students from all sorts of unexpected problems like housing, food insecurities, and financial trouble. It is a very safe location with on campus housing."

Senior,5,"I love how diverse our campus is. Everyone is very friendly, and there's always something to do. Class sizes are nice and small so everyone is attended to."
Graduate Student,5,"I learned so much during my time at Northeastern. The faculty in my major department went above and beyond to ensure I succeeded and got the most out of my degree. The culture is not as diverse as I would like it to be, however, the student body did make efforts to cultivate an accepting environment."
Graduate Student,5,"Since I went to the first informational meeting regarding the graduate program, I always felt taken care of and inform. I love that there is a lot of resources for the student and easy to communicate with staff and professors."

Between health and wellness services, financial aid services, scholarships, access to the PE complex gym and pool, free fitness classes, and more, NEIU is a top college to attend."
Freshman,5,What I like about the university is all the resources that it provides for either a low price or no cost at all.  Another thing I love it is provides high quality teaching found in a private school when Northeastern is a public school.  Knowing the fact that it's cheaper too makes it possible for many to attend regardless of the background.
Niche User,5,"This school has a beautiful and safe campus. It has a great environment. I like the diversity of this school.  It is in Chicago and it is affordable compares to many other universities. Its campus is small and not too far my house. It's easy for me to get around this campus. Also, there is free parking around the campus. The teachers and staffs seem to be nice and well educated.

The staff helps you make your transition into university easy with constant support and information booths to get you started on the right track."
Niche User,5,"My experience at Northeastern Illinois University has been great so far. The campus is easy to figure out/find where the buildings and classrooms are. The advisers are very knowledgeable on helping you stay on track with your major. The financial aid office can be improved a little as it does take a very long time for them to contact you back or get things completed in a timely matter. But otherwise, the professors have been mostly great so far and the classes are engaging and I have learned so much from each and every class i have took here so far."
Sophomore,5,It is a great college. It is a great college. It is a great college. It is a great college. It is a great college. It is a great college. It is a great college. It is a great college.

Alum,5,Northeastern Illinois University is my second home. Its welcoming and caring environment provides students with an easy transition from high school or transferring students of a community college. I love that its a smaller size university offering class sizes of up to 30 students. All the professors are genuine and helpful and have very flexible office hours always dedicating their time to ensure their students successes. I would say that the only improvement needed would be the increase in more 21st century technology.
Senior,5,"Northeastern is a great University, the staff and professors are amazing and always smile to students. I went to a community college before NEIU but was not very happy and excited like being at NEIU. In order to learn you need very good professors and that's exactly what NEIU has, the professors know what you want and know how to teach you and not have you get bored in class. The campus overall is big, even though it's big you still see other people/students and feel safe and at home."
Freshman,5,"I like that they do care about my well being,and my education. My mother's main concern was if we were going to be able to afford going to college. This school has made it able for me to go here and have an awesome college experience. I am able to have great relationships with my financial aid adviser,and go through hard obstacles with my friends by my side. I am the first generation to go to college and it is a lot of pressure,but it's totally worth it."
Freshman,5,Northeastern Illinois University is a great environment for those who seek a diverse community and welcoming vibes through the campus. It is a remarkable  place to start off into since they offer many guidance and helps from professors that know what they're doing to guide you to the right path.

Freshman,5,"Applying to Northeastern was the best decisions I made. I love the campus, the diversity, and the amazing professors they have."
Sophomore,5,"I believe that Northeastern Illinois University is a great where you can focus on your education and be able to ask anyone for help if you need it.

This university is very diverse with many students of different races that adds culture to the school because if you ever wanted to learn about someone's culture or race, you can ask them and listen to what they have to say."
Sophomore,5,"Northeastern Illinois University is a very diverse school. Everywhere I go, I see a new face. Our professors are very outgoing and full of energy. There are so many resources here that you would not have to worry about finding information or even finding a place that gives you information. All around the campus there is always something new going on. From job fairs to ice cream outside, there is always movement. Around the community there is a lot of places to go to as well."
Sophomore,5,Most of the professors are overall understanding and try to help you the best way they can. The student disability office is helpful as well.
Freshman,5,"Northeastern Illinois University is a sort of small school. We have a lot of activities going on every week, and luckily have plenty of organizations that support students with finals week; massages, food, study sessions. Professors always have their office hours and show interest, of course if you do as well."
Junior,5,I have only been a student here for two semesters. One of which was a difficult in my personal life and affected my accademic life. My professors worked with me to catch up on the days I missed. The professors care about the students. I also notice that the professors do their best too keep all students motivated. I love my school.
Sophomore,5,I loved the professors and students at Northeastern Illinois University. They were welcoming and very helpful. My professors always pushed me to do my very best and my grades reflected the amount of work I put in. I loved going to all of my classes because I knew I would learn something new everyday.
Senior,5,So far my experience has been wobderful! I have enjoyed my class and the teacher knew how to teach the course in just 12 classes. It was amazing. I am movitated for the upcoming years.
Senior,5,"The climate and culture at Northeastern Illinois University is superb! The staff genuinely care about the education of the students. I have changed my major three times, and each department was so knowledgable and supportive! The campus is also extremely diverse!"
Sophomore,5,The people that come to this university are very kind and will help with anything that you need. The faculty are very understand and get it if u have to work or have problem going on in your personal life.
Graduate Student,5,"The education I have received so far has been amazing. The teachers are very knowledgeable, passionate and very interested in ones success. You can clearly see that the vision and mission of the school match the way they hire teachers and the quality of teaching they provide. I am very happy to be a part of Northeastern."
Senior,5,"The diverse student body provides perspectives for all class topics to be seen from a wide variety of cultural, political, and religious backgrounds. The Professors and administrators are supportive and challenge each student to bring their best self to their academic pursuits."
Junior,4,"I have taken online classes. The platform where the courses are available is 
self- explanatory. It is easy to navigate through a course."
Junior,4,"I like that even though it is a large university, it feels like a small community college. It is a perfect transition from high school to a university. Many of the professors are easy to talk and are available whenever you have questions or concerns. I think the school may be in need of some tcl, but honestly nothing major. It is a clean school."
Sophomore,4,"Cause of Covid  19 most of my classes are remote but over all my experience has been good. There were a few things I think they can approve on when it comes to online classes. For Instance, for online classes we use the Zoom app and sometimes the connection wouldn't be all that good, so I do recommend having a back up video chat app. Other than that my school is great!"
Senior,4,Overall NEIU is a good value school with professors that genuinely care for their students. The administration can be a nightmare to deal with...lots of bureaucracy and if you need help with an issue you will be chasing people down in a million different departments to get your issue solved.
Senior,4,"There are still mostly in-person classes that would interfere with adult students with day jobs, however many of these classes aren't offered online/remote either."
Junior,4,"During these difficult times of Covid-19, Northeastern has been keeping new and transfer students connected to the school. Northeastern has hosted multiple virtual conferences about the transfer process and financial aid."
Senior,4,Very diverse school with many different majors and minors to choose from. Easy to get to using public transportation and one of the cheapest universities in Chicago.
Senior,4,"Online classes were fairly easy, and the Desire2Learn platform used to turn in assignments is quite simple to use."
Senior,4,"This school is great to get a degree and be able to focus on your outside life. This school is very hard to find friends, but it’s a great school if you want to get your degree and not worry about partying. Love the campus and has a lot of quiet places where you can study and enjoy a snack or a meal."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Northeastern Illinois University has so far been good. It has been above my expectations. As a first-year student I have gotten support from a specific program; Proyecto Pa'lante and my advisor from that program has provided me with support. Also tutoring services were offered and available to me at any time also there are others services to support us and have provided us with. What I liked about Northeastern Illinois University is the diversity and the environment. Northeastern is small and simple campus that in which you may be able to find your classes easily and being able to have access to services easily. Also, if support is needed in any type of way you can have access to that. As a first-year student experiencing at Northeastern what I would like to see change is not allowing students to buy textbooks that costs more than $30."
Junior,4,"With the current world situation, the majority of my classes are online.  So far, my experience with online courses at NEIU has been positive.  Although online courses may be new to the majority of the students at NEIU, for me, as a veteran student, it is a very familiar setting that accommodates the need and fits well within the current world situation of the pandemic."
Junior,4,"A lot of professors care about the students' success. Good education for a good amount of money. Administration is a little all over the place, otherwise a good state school!"
Senior,4,"A great and affordable school, the academic staff is pretty knowledgeable and has flexible class hours as well as facility department hours. I would recommend this school to all of my friends."
Senior,4,Northeastern Illinois University is a very Diverse University.  The students and staff are very welcoming.
Senior,4,I am a senior who is planning on checking out the campus during the summer or on spring break to check it out. My sister Jade still go to this campus to get her bachelors degree. And my Mom told me that they have my major which is music so I hope I go to the campus one day and join a music class to experience what is like.
Freshman,4,The college app is very readable in terms of figuring out where to locate things on the site. I manged to locate all of the resources that I needed.
Senior,4,NEIU has worked with me to roll all of the courses I have taken into a degree.  They are also assisting me in finding a graduate program.  The course times and locations are a good fit.  Instructors have also worked with me on communicating via email as opposed to making me come to the campus to fill out documents that can be handled online.
Freshman,4,great environment for the students. easy to get to if you live close. good enough restaurants to go to if you live on campus and can spend lots of time at the gym or the public library.
Sophomore,4,"I like the attention the professors give me when i need it. Many tutors are there at my to take advantage of, and that is good for me. I would recommend Northeastern to anybody who needs a lot of attention like myself. I am over 50 years old and i do not feel discriminated, all the faculty and student body treats me like anybody else, and that is important to me."
Senior,4,The campus and its staff are great. When ever I have issues that I need help with I can always find a faculty member to help me. The classes are great with helpful professors. The campus is clean and easy to navigate with enough parking.
Junior,4,"The location of the school is in a safe and diverse area. The classrooms are outdated, some with even chalkboards. The facility is clean but could do some work. The art teachers were all great and passionate about their teachings which was really encouraging to see. The academic advisors are helpful and able to fit you in for an appointment quickly which was really convenient."
Junior,4,I like that the university is very diverse and It has changed a lot for the better throughout the years.
Junior,4,"I think my experience here thus far has went very well, I like most of my professors and I think that this is a diverse community. I feel at home away from home when I am in classes and whenever I need help most times it is not hard to find someone."
Sophomore,4,It's a small school with the university feel to it. I've such amazing professors so far and don't regret going here.
Niche User,4,It is a very beautiful campus. It is safe when it comes to students. The neighborhood is safe. The academics are very good. Everyone is very welcoming. The classes are a decent size.
Junior,4,What I like about northeastern Illinois university its diversity.  I don't feel left out. I also love their programs such as TRIO they help you stay on track to graduate. The social works professors are great! They are very open-minded and compassionate.
Junior,4,Northeastern Illinois University is a peaceful environment that’s one of the most diverse in the country. It makes class dynamic interesting to share so many different opinions from so many different backgrounds. Professors are knowledgeable and make meaningful connections for students to understand the philosophy of teaching in such a diverse school setting. I plan to graduate with a bachelors in education and I plan to continue my education in a masters program at Northeastern Illinois University.
Niche User,4,The school is such a perfect size. Dorm rooms look nice and cozy. Staff is Eco-friendly. Food is fantastic
Junior,4,"Everyone is helpful, the staff is nice and so are students. the campus is beautiful. I am always excited to come to school and check out the campus/campus life. All of the staff are super friendly and willing to make sure you are on the path to success."
Freshman,4,"What I like about Northeastern Illinois University is the diversity. Meeting someone different from you teaches you things and it is nice to be around others who are not like you. Northeastern also has great professors. I have had professors who are really passionate about what they teach and make the material engaging and as clear as possible for students to understand. Lastly, the amount of help there is for students is amazing.  There is tutors all everywhere on campus and the scheduling hours are flexible. Northeastern has always made me feel supported with these things. What I would like to see change is possibly adding a different variety of courses.
 I would like to take some forensic course but the closest thing to a forensics course are the criminology courses here at Northeastern. I believe exposing students to specific ideas, courses, resources, can open up other paths for students to explore along with growing academically."
Junior,4,The college itself is a bit dated but overall I enjoy it. The teacher to student ratio is nice and it's a great thing to be able to have a more personal relationship with the professors.
Junior,4,"You get what you pay for. The school is relatively cheap but you're definitely not going to get the same tier education as you would at Loyola, for example. The academics are definitely decent and you will get a job with a degree from this school. I'm adding an extra star for the professors because they really take the experience and make it above and beyond."
Senior,4,"Northeastern Illinois University has many experienced/knowledgeable  professors. A few professors, however, I believe  need more knowledge/experience related to the field in which they are teaching."
Senior,4,I am a current Northeastern Illinois University student. My major is mathematics. NEIU is a warm place because most teachers are very nice and helpful. Most teachers would like to help their student pass the class and figure out what questions did they have and help them how to solve. Even the classmates are very nice too and helping each other to get better. I love Northeastern Illinois University.
Sophomore,4,"I definitely like the diversity of the school, which includes people of all backgrounds, ethnicities, ages, and race."
Junior,4,"I transferred from a community collage and thought I would get lost with the process and with the fact how big the school is, but it was easy . Teachers are greater to communicate with and always helpful. I 
Love this University and i hope to graduate in Managment but it is hard for me to afford it."
Junior,4,NEIU is a nice campus. The students and faculty are very nice and willing to help anyone. Their cafeteria has a great selection of foods that you didn't think they would have!
Freshman,4,"I like how organized and invested they are. Also, the variety of majors they have. It is always clean. The professors do well in teaching and getting the students to be more involved in the class."
Junior,4,Northeastern is a very diverse and liberal college. The student body is very active and the professors challenge your core beliefs and push you to become an actual educated person.
Niche User,4,Great diversity. Close to home. Visited a couple times because of school field trips. I was a great experience and it seemed that people enjoyed being there. You get positive vibes.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Northeastern has so far been good. I like the fact that it is a small school because the students get more attention. It's a college, but to me it feels like a much bigger high school. I love it here."
Junior,4,"What I like about Northeastern Illinois University is that all my classes are around the campus and I don't have to walk a lot to get to classes. This school has a good variety of programs that go from a Bachelor's to a Master's degree.  Programs that are included, but are not limited to, are Busines, Science, accounting, Languages, etc...This is one of the top safest campuses that I have been too. I feel comfortable coming to school and say that I really enjoy coming to this university. The only thing that sucks from this school is the food, for some people it may be good, but it's kind of pricey. If there was something that I would change from school is I would make the bathrooms bigger and more spacious because they are all small, and sometimes I feel that people in here don't have much space around."
Sophomore,4,"its a very welcoming place, you just need to know where to look for help at. I had trouble there my first year because I did not know get informed on certain things, so just ask for help and anybody there will point you in the right direction."
Junior,4,"Great college. Very helpful counselors and great teachers. There is free parking all around the campus. Overall, enjoyable experience."
Freshman,4,"It is an honor to attend, such a great school as Northeastern because I am academically challenged everyday. In NEIU it is a diverse school that includes alot of resources for students to use."
Sophomore,4,I like that everyone is friendly even the professors are friendly since they always say hi or good morning etc.
Junior,4,"With the state of Illinois facing a third year without a budget, the staff and faculty at NEIU have remained dedicated to, and supportive of the diverse student body. The cost of attendance is very affordable, and you definitely get more than you pay for here."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love how friendly the students and professors are. They actually want to see you succeed. I feel like the school an help students much more as far as financially. They don't help us get any loans or grants. We have to find that on our own, or pay out of pocket. School is not cheap."
Freshman,4,"As my first semester at NEIU, I never felt more comfortable any place else. I transferred, from first to second semester of my freshman year from BenU. I needed a university closer to home, and an afforable one, which is what brought me to NEIU. My professors this spring were amazing. They allowed for student engagament within classes, guided us through lessons, and were patient enough to review with students as we engaged with harder material. College is hard, it is tough, but at the resources at NEIU help you thrive through the semester. Tutors, the library, and upper classmen were such an amazing help to me this semester."
Alum,4,"I would to see better staff in charge. When I was going to NEIU, the staff made sure to strip us of any rights possible. For eg: When I was a president of one of the clubs, in order for me to request 50$ for drinks, I have had to go through many forms only to realize it didn't go through and finally when it did go through, it was shown as we had ""stolen"" the money. Other clubs got $2000 or more to just throw parties. So while it is not a party school, it needs better management. However, the classes were cheap and affordable."
Junior,4,"NEIU is an okay school. It's not horrible, but it's not the best-it's just average.
 I live in the dorms and I HATE it! Unless you have money to waste DO NOT MOVE INTO THE NEST! You're better off finding a couple of other students and moving into an apartment near campus for the price. The RAs act like they're in high school, it's waaaaay over priced ($833/mo/room & increasing every yr),  the roommate matching tool is a joke, no one enforces/respects quite hours during final and midterms, my refrigerator just randomly stopped working twice, loud weed smell throughout the hallways, stupid guest policy, a utility cap of $80, (yes, even after getting 40k+/yr per 4 bdrm apt. they still will charge you if your total bill is more than $80-which will happen!),  overall incompetence & disorganization & lying by the housing office staff, leaky sinks, drafty windows, overall cheapy looking and definitely not worth the 3,332/mo that they're collecting from my roommates & I!!"
Freshman,4,I love the school as a whole. I have had nothing but good experiences especially when it comes to being able to get in contact with any administration.
Junior,4,"My experience at Northeastern Illinois University as a freshman was great. The people there are very kind, no judgement at all and they really make you feel like family the moment you step into their Student Union building, they have so many great clubs and what I like about is that they make sure they don't leave anybody out and the teachers at the University are very helpful and do everything they can to help you be back on track."
Freshman,4,"I haven't been going here for long, but in the short time that I was here, I have really enjoyed it. The best part about College by far has been the flexibility of my schedule. In High School, I would have to be there from 7:30 to 1:47 for 5 days a week. In College, I get to pick my own classes, along with my schedule. The professors are friendly and the workload is surprisingly slim. The only thing I do miss from High School is the shorter classes, but in College, they're only 25 minutes longer."
Freshman,4,Everything is amazing except for the financial aid office. Most of the people working in there are rude and slow. 
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe every day that I go to school. I remember during freshman orientation they said that if you ever don't feel safe there are those posts around the campus where you press a button and campus police can walk you to your class if you are there at night. I always see an neiu cop car going around the area which makes me feel safe.
College Sophomore,4,The people are nice and there is someone that is always willing to help. The emails they send always let you know what's going on so you don't miss out on something that could be of interest to you. The teachers want you to do your best.
College Sophomore,4,IN El Centro campus we didnt have a cafeteria but this upcoming semester we will.
College Sophomore,4,You can get help at any time. there is a variety for student part-time and full-time jobs. Tutoring is great and studying resources are available at any time.
College Senior,4,Have not heard of not been made aware of any sexual assault history on campus.
Junior,2,Pretty much 100% self-directed. The professors post material online. You read the material and do homework.
Graduate Student,2,"This school has proven to be very disappointing. The teachers have been great, which is the only plus. The administration has been very difficult and I have had multiple difficulties just trying to attend this school and having my financial aid distributed."
Alum,2,"Great school for a commuter. The school has some very excellent professors. But there are no sports, little in the way of activities that connect the student body and is terrible on disseminating information. The biggest problem is the oppressive liberal attitude of the administration and many professors. There is no diversity of thought, if you don't completely believe the liberal ideology you are subjected to hate, and being bullied.  That the education is cheap really shows at NEIU."
College Sophomore,2,I honestly never hear anything sports related through email or on the televisions placed around the schools. They mainly post about performances like music or theater related or just other non-sport events.
College Senior,2,We don't have any teams- only intramural programs.
College Junior,2,I haven't heard anyone mention our athletics department.
College Junior,2,"There is no campus housing. They are working to fix that by building a dorm in the middle of campus. Non-school housing options are great, since there are literally millions of apartments throughout the city."
College Sophomore,2,There's no teams to be able to play on or to participate! I run cross country and track and I would love to participate if Neiu had a team but unfortunately they do not.
College Sophomore,2,"Over the past couple of years, Northeastern Illinois University has cut a numerous amount of their sports due to financial budget cuts. This has affected myself, as well as hundreds of other students from receiving a sport scholarship in a certain sport. Hence, the small amount of physical activities offered at NEIU is not enough. Inorder to have a active environment, the university should for example, fundraise for the addition of another sport."
College Sophomore,2,"Due to Northeastern Illinois University currently not having an On-Campus site, our Greek Life situation is not very active. NEIU does offer a lot of options for Greek Life, however, not enough. There is currently no Greek housing available at the moment. Yet, group meetings and events are offered to Olathe individuals who wish to participate in Greek life ."
College Junior,2,It has lots of nice people bu the classes are too easy and the teachers are not the best.
College Sophomore,2,"there is no variety.

its either salad, pizza, burger or nasty sandwhiches and highly over priced"
College Sophomore,2,Everything near the school if fast food and they are somewhat expensive.
College Sophomore,2,I never hear about anything going on around campus
College Senior,2,It was ok until I had a major problem in Fall 2014
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't any teams in Northeastern. There use to be, but not anymore. They have good equipment to start programs like swimming/diving, football, tennis, and more, but nobody does anything. Overall Northeastern has want it needs to get started but nothing has happened."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Its a commuter school, there are no parties."
College Senior,2,"Long waits at financial aid office makes it very difficult for busy, working commuter students."
College Senior,2,"I haven't seen much recruitment on campus, but the experience I received in my clinical trainings was ideal.  We do also have a great student teaching program that may lead you to a future career opportunity."
College Junior,2,"The city is wonderful, everyone is so friendly and is so positive. There is always someone you can talk to on your short walk."
College Junior,2,"The signing up for classes online is much harder then it needs to be, i like how the campus is spread out more then other colleges which seem a little cramped."
College Junior,2,If your not in greek life your not really enjoying college according to members from greek life.
College Student,2,"I have to drive back and froth everyday, the cost will be high along with the cost of parking. Why the parking can't be free."
College Senior,2,"The whole system in Northeastern is slow and not helpful. I've emailed and called several departments to assist me with some problems but no one seems to know or I am transferred to someone else.

Tip: Be prepared for a headache"
College Senior,2,The library has a very small section of computers. There is a room in one of the buildings with more computers but it is always packed during crunch times. I need to bring my own computer.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really like the teachers not because of how they teach, but the grading is an issue. I find myself always confronting a teacher about my grades."
College Sophomore,2,I don't get along with many people at school becaus ethey are very judgemental.
College Junior,2,Northeastern Illinois University hardly has any athletics.
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, Greek Life is pretty nonexistent at Northeastern Illinois"
College Junior,2,"The school provides all students with a cta bus card to facilitate transportation. However, the cost if the transportation is included in the tuition whether you use it or not. "
College Junior,2,"There is always a line in the financial aid office from students who have issues with their financial aid. Overall, they intend to help you and resolve any issue but it may take a while and be a hassle. "
College Senior,2,It is a commuter campus and the school is very affordable. But costing less means that you get what you pay for. SOme staff are very rude and act like they don't care. My emails or concerns are never answered and I always get attitude when I ask questions and treated like I am stupid.
College Senior,2,There is not enough space for all the students that attend. It is hard to find a spot to sit and study between classes and the chairs aren't comfortable at all.
College Senior,2,The school has a list of off campus places but it is old and never updated. Occasionally I do see postings on campus but not enough. The school doesn't assist students with this and there is a lot of residential housing and not many options for students nearby. I don't feel very safe in the neighborhood around the school either.
College Senior,2,"I have never eaten on campus. Occasionally I by some chips from the vending machine, but there is only one on campus place to either get a salad or sandwich. I didn't like any of the options available there and have never purchased anything from there or the cafeteria of my school. I wait to eat when I get home usually."
College Senior,2,There aren't any options to eat at on campus that I like and nothing is close enough to the campus to walk to between classes.
College Senior,2,"There's not much too close by, and the choices are the usual sandwich shops and fast food places. There's a real lack of selection or variety nearby, and the dearth can be frustrating, as the on-campus selections are the usual dreadful cafeteria fare."
College Junior,2,Good parking lots but no space to accommodate to handicap students without having to have a permit.
College Sophomore,2,Academics are very limited and many some classes are boring.
College Senior,2,"Do yourself a favor and walk off campus into the neighborhood for food because all you'll find at school is a sandwich shop and bad American-Chinese food. We used to have a milkshake maker but it's gone and so is my dining happiness. As a commuter school we don't have dorms so there is no meal plan. That being said, the food can be a little on the pricey side: that's why you're better off exploring the neighborhood and eating better, healthier food away from school. Our coffee shop, however, does brew good coffee and they do have salads and pastas to choose but those are pricey."
College Junior,2,NEIU is a commuter school so athletics don't feature highly in student life.
College Junior,2,"I did not receive financial aid this year but am appealing the decision. The school has their own rules for when they'll consider an appeal, so be sure to check with the financial aid office. The school also has a pretty good database of institutional scholarhips you can apply for that are separate from the financial aid process. Most of these are for continuing students, however, so incoming freshman and transfers might not have much luck."
College Senior,2,"I've found a lot of apartments in the area around campus, but they are usually small and expensive. It's very hard to afford a one bedroom apartment and even the studios can be pricey. The best way to go is to try to find a roommate. That way you'll be able to afford something with more space and better amenities. Being close to campus isn't really an issue because there is so much public transportation in Chicago."
College Junior,2,"Several issues with financial aid, and almost no scholoraships"
College Freshman,2,"Most students are campus are not really all over the place . Students are more calm, almost like highscool really. There aren't a lot of security haired roaming around Campus like I would expect. There are a lot of professors who dislike loud people in hall ways when they are trying to teach and they do not care whisking them up."
College Senior,2,There is nothing special about it.  My only problem is the school is very dusty and I have had to take a lot of antihistamines in order to not cough myself to death.
College Senior,2,Nothing special.  There is a food court with a Subway in it.  The vending machines in the school only work half of the time.   The rest of the restaurants in the food court are terrible.
College Junior,2,It's extremely cold in the winter and the whole spring season it was either raining or snowing. The campus does do a good job of getting rid of snow on walkways and paths.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life doesn't really play a huge part at Northeastern I know it exists but it doesn't dominate.
College Sophomore,2,There are not many bars or clubs near Northeastern. There is a hookah bar a couple blocks away but there are bus stops near to take to a couple bars.
College Junior,2,"There are not many places around campus. House parties are at a minimum, bar/clubs are not within walking distance."
College Junior,2,"The athletic facility is fairly nice, but there are no varsity sports to watch. There are come intramural sports, and they can be fairly exciting to watch."
College Sophomore,2,For undergrads the only nightlife is house parties. For eveyone 21 and up nightlife is great there are many areas in the city not to far from campus with great bar scenes.
College Sophomore,2,"Not very helpful, my mother is a single mom and we received no help at all."
College Junior,2,"The sports are not well advertised so I don't really know what kinds of sports are available at NEIU. I know that the school does have sports teams though, since I've seen them outside practicing."
College Sophomore,2,"Permitted School Parking and U-Pass – Paying over three-hundred dollars for a semester of parking at Northeastern Illinois University Parking lot I would think there would be enough parking spaces for every student that pays. But there is not. I had to circle the parking lot over 30 mins to find a parking space. Very disappointed in how much I need to pay. 
Also I wish there was an option for students to WANT to purchase the U-pass . Instead of forcing the students to pay for the U-pass when some already is driving to school and gas is a high expense. I would not want to pay for the U-pass when I am never going to use it because if I was to travel with the U-pass it would take me over 2 hours of two buses and two train rides with total of three transfer. Making my round trip over 4 hours to commute to school and back home."
College Freshman,2,"Depends Where You Want to Live – the one thing i like about this school is that you can get to it by bus, car, or foot. i live less then 20 maybe 30min away by car. it depends on where you want to live and what you want to pay for depending thins you are lloking to have either in your home or around it. so if you look you can find something nice but many people are updating apartment and may charge a bit for it but roommates are always great."
College Senior,2,Limited Amount of Resturants – there are very generic places around there and its hard to drive back and forth to get them and the on campus food is not the best the food resturants should be improved in this area.
College Sophomore,2,"Apartments Are Expensive – The apartments near the campus are abit expensive.  I've spoken with a few fellow students that live further away from campus near it due to the cost, a 20-30 minute drive is not worth the price paying for an apartment near campus. Majority of the housing around campus are mostly family owned."
College Sophomore,2,"It's Ok for a Quick Meal – There's a few places around campus you can go too if you have a car and a few in walking distance.  The food at the campus is alright if you want something quick to eat and you have to get somethings done and can't leave, also they have subway there which is a good place to eat if you want a sandwich or if your watching what your eating."
Freshman,1,"There are so many things that I can say about this school. For one, the financial aid office sucks. It's literally no support here. I've been waiting for someone to pinch me to wake me up because I cannot believe that this is called a ""University"". The teachers and advisers are all a joke. No one cares about anything unless it benefits them. Oh not to mention, you're charged for the silliest things. Just to have a parking fee removed off of your student account is a pain. This was the worse experience ever. Please choose differently. You get what you pay for!"
Graduate Student,1,"I have a disability  and did not need specialized services until I hot to student teaching....The university  instructors even had the audacity  to tell me they would visit me in the placement every week.....and didn't... I was not registered with  the University  SPED services becaude they stated they needed a Neuro psychological assessment  less than a year old....when in all actuality (as per the neuropsychological exam administer/ doctor said they are good for 5 years).   Numerous  emails and 3 in person meetings (most of which were a complete waste of time because of the beaurocratic  red tape a student endures).  I wanted to teach and the Dean of the C.O.E. Maureen Gillette said ""You should  have transfered to Nation Louis afer our last meeting"".  Their solution was me to take a 3 credit  hour Masters level course, get the M.A. without  teaching licensure."
College Junior,1,I've seen none of these things on campus.
College Freshman,1,"There is absolutely no Greek Life at Northeastern Illinois University, and as a result the community surrounding the school has stayed without any drama or fiasco. A majority of students on campus have a positive attitude toward their school's lack of Greek life."
College Sophomore,1,They are constructing new dorms but there is no dorms as of right now
College Sophomore,1,"Due to the fact of Northeastern Illinois University not being an on-campus campus, it lacks the social night life for students and their ability to experience it."
College Sophomore,1,There is no night life at Northeastern Illinois University.
College Sophomore,1,No student housing offered yet.
College Junior,1,Never heard of student career prospects
College Sophomore,1,i get no help from the school. i deserve grants!
College Sophomore,1,The area is a horrible area filled with gangs and violence. It is hard to find a good apartment that is good priced everything is over priced.
College Sophomore,1,No one at that school knows anything about financial aid. They do not even attempt to help you and are extremely rude towards you.
College Sophomore,1,"There are no campus housing. Therefore, there is nothing to grade."
College Senior,1,There is no night-life around NEIU.
College Sophomore,1,"THERE IS NO CAMPUS HOUSING!! 

That's the one thing that turned me off about this school. I wanted the college experience, and to me having a dorm with a roommate is a big part of that! So I felt like I missed out on my first year of college already."
College Freshman,1,"We don't have anything to provide off campus housing, again, we all are commuters."
College Freshman,1,"We don't have any housing in my college, we're ALL commuters."
College Student,1,I can't find decent scholarships that I can apply for.
College Senior,1,I do not know of the athletics at school. They are not advertised.
College Sophomore,1,"I prefer an art school. This school is definatlly not for art students. There are some creartive classes, but students will feel insecure about telling others about their major."
College Sophomore,1,"Chicago has bad weather in the winter, and the summers are very hot. Snow days can become a problem because it throws off the campus scheduels."
College Senior,1,"The advisors are not helpful. The office seems to be full of employees to help, but students have to wait a long time to see an advisor. They do not explain things well and tell you one thing but do another. Not happy and a completely terrible experience."
Recent Alumnus,1,I'm not aware of a huge Greek community at school.
College Senior,1,"they really do not care about the ehalth of the students. they have a $750.00 insuarance plan that you have to take with the tuition and it does not cover anything not even doctor visits, emergency care, anything."
College Junior,1,NEIU does not have any college sports.  There are certain clubs you can sign up for in order to play your favorite sport.
College Junior,1,"By the CCICS Campus, there aren't any options other than vending machines. You have to travel to 43rd St, 39th St, or 35th St. This is obviously difficult if your not in a vehicle"
College Junior,1,The police are horrible with writing tickets. They watch your every move waiting to write you a ticket.
College Sophomore,1,There is not a lot of buzz about sports around the campus.  At least not around me.  I have not heard too much about any teams at NEIU.  I'm not even sure what kind of teams we do have to be honest.
College Senior,1,"I receive no financial aid because my father's salary is too high and he claims me as a dependent even though I pay for my classes, books, etc.. So I cannot receive any financial aid for need based reasons until I turn 24. You also don't receive any scholarships from the school if you aren't a full time student. In order to pay for school I need to keep my job which makes it so I haven't been able to sign up for 12 credits yet, even though I have a perfect grade point average. They need to change the guidelines for scholarships."
College Sophomore,1,"They want to charge you for everything (there are many fees). The location of the Chicago main campus does not make it the best for public transportation, but it is located in a safe neighborhood."
College Junior,1,"No real nightlife, it is in the middle of residential areas with not much going on. If there was on campus dorms this would definitely change."
College Senior,1,"There is nothing I regret more than my decision to attend NEIU.  While this is not all encompassing, there are many professors at this school who are exceptionally poor communicating with their students.  When I appealed a grade change (which I eventually won) I was threatened by a member of the department to drop the appeal.  I chose to come here because I had some community college classes that were not transferable to schools I preferred.  There is not a single thing I wish more right now than the ability to go back in time and warn myself.  I am graduating with honors, so no one needs to jump on me for blaming the school for problems.  I am graduating with honors IN SPITE of NEIU's faculty, not because of it.  The financial aid department is run by morons and every single administrative detail is communicated poorly.  The people I have met here do not care about your future."
College Senior,1,The majority of the course work makes me feel like I am in Junior High School rather than college.  I learned a lot more at Junior College.
College Sophomore,1,We don't even have a sports team. How can you promote school spirit without even one sports team?
College Senior,1,"This is a suburban environment that is a commuter school. There is nothing to do locally, as its only houses around campus. However, if you really want to do something, you can walk a mile to public transportation, or walk about 5 blocks down to find a hookah bar and a few restaurants."
College Senior,1,"Varsity sports don't really exist at NEIU as it is a commuter school with working class students. There is no football team, however intramural activities are fairly popular, though not many people come to watch."
College Senior,1,There isnt really a dedicated cafeteria but good snack selection at school book store
College Junior,1,"I pay an exorbitant amount of money for a parking pass, yet 7 out of 10 times I cannot find a parking spot in the appropriate parking lot. This disorganization needs to be rectified."
College Senior,1,Not a School for Sports – There is a few interscholastic sports but not very many at all. I would not consider this school you want to join a team sport.
College Sophomore,1,"Registration, FAFSA, and Academic Advisors – Registration is not so bad but when there is a hold on your account therefore stopping you to register for classes, there is no point in calling the school. I call many times and each time they just keep transferring me to another person and finally going to a caller that is not in their office forcing you to leave a voicemail. ( sometimes the voicemail would be FULL and you cannot even leave a voicemail but even if you could it would be pointless. THEY NEVER CALL YOU BACK TRUST ME. I leave me name, ID, phone number but no one at that school has ever called me back. From Financial Aid office advisors to Academic Advisors. )"

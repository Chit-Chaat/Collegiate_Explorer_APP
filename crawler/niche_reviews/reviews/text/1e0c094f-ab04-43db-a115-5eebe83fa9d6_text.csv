Senior,5,"I love the location, professors, relationships, and opportunities. The curriculum including the mandatory internships is beneficial for gaining experience in the fashion industry."
Freshman,5,"LIM College is a great place. I love going to the city and going to different locations which are not far away from each other, about 5-10 minute walk. The professors are great and the classes are very interesting. The college is pretty diverse and everyone is nice. Professors are great and you can really get a lot out of them."
Freshman,5,"I have had a great online experience with LIM College and all the professors were really nice. However, I would still chose to go back to normal studying since it is still difficult to study online."
Freshman,5,LIM College overall is an excellent college. You want to learn all about the fashion industry? Go there for sure.
Freshman,5,"I love LIM College! The campus is located in the city, which gives you even more reason to explore the fun and vibrant city. The students are generally really nice and friendly. So far, all the professors I’ve had are really nice & truly care about the students, making sure we all succeed. The professors know what they’re teaching due to real experience in the subject fields. Student life isn’t the best, as there are some events that are a little cheesy, but they do make sure to be very inclusive through their clubs made to represent the underrepresented.
It's NYC, so of course there’s a great party scene.
Dorms are not in the best condition at all, but it's a great way to meet new people if you're not from the city.
Overall, I would say that LIM is a great college to go, as it puts you at an advantage when coming out of college, as it leaves you more prepared for the real world and with a higher chance of finding a job soon after college."
Freshman,5,"I love attending LIM, I thought my transition from H.S to College would have been difficult. I thought I would have a hard time adjusting, meeting friends and keeping up with the work. But its been the total opposite for me. I'm enjoying learning about fashion, connecting with my peers. And the professors have been great."
Junior,5,I’ve recently transferred here to pursue a degree in fashion merchandising and they have made everything so easy! The transition from one school to the other could not have gone smoother.
Sophomore,5,"My experience with LIM College was amazing when I first met them. They made me feel very comfortable and were very kind and helped with so much. Every question i asked they gave me an answer to which was very convenient when going through with my application process. LIM College is the most perfect place for me to pursue my fashion career. I recommend anyone that has a passion for fashion to attend LIM College ""Where Business Meets Fashion""."
Senior,5,LIM has helped me figure out what I’ve wanted to do with my future! They have also been such a guidance with academics.
Freshman,5,I really love that LIM College's core teaching method is Experiential Learning! The institution wants students to not only succeed but their goal is that we graduate with an advantage. Earning a degree With LIM College means gaining hands on experience that makes students at LIM College a force! With knowing how to do the jobs we apply for we come in with a confidence to do well and the knowledge to be an asset to the company because of the wisdom we will impart to our co-workers.
Sophomore,5,"I do not live in the residence hall, but from I heard and seen form friends who reside there, It is a  beautiful dorm area. You have bars, clubs and restaraumts within steps and everuyone is very kind to one another. The guards are always on their feet when it comes to guarding the hall and the students."
Niche User,5,"This school is located in New York City, a place known for new beginnings. LIM offers a wide variety of opportunities for all its students. With it being located in such an amazing city, there is never a dull moment. You can always find something to do. If you are not studying, the campus has many surrounding stores, restaurants, and bars."
Junior,5,It gives you hands on knowledge and experiences and pushes you to take on new challenges and apply for various positions that will later help you in the industry.
Freshman,5,In my first year at LIM I have already learned and accomplished so much.  LIM prides itself on the amount of internships they require students to complete during their 4 years to prepare them for the work force.  I already see how well prepared I am going to be after 3 more years.
Sophomore,5,"I am very happy with my decision to attend LIM College. When applying to this school I wasn't really sure what to expect but so far I have been really impressed. All of the professors either currently work or have worked in the fashion industry and have a wealth of knowledge to share with the students. The internships are incredible, in only my second year of college I was able to assist in opening the flagship store of Victoria's Secret on Fifth Avenue. Would highly recommend this college to anyone who has a passion for the business side of fashion."
Junior,5,It's a great fashion tied with business school. Amazing optortunities for those who want to get their foot in the fashion world.
College Senior,5,"A lot of students who have graduated through LIM have moved on to huge companies such as Gucci, Stella McCartney and other big styling brands, as well.  The list goes on!"
College Senior,5,"I love how intimate the classes are, they're very small which is the best because you can have a close relation to your professor.  The class styles are also great because each professor does it differently, and doesn't go completely by the books."
College Sophomore,5,"LIM College has helped me become a better, more confident person. The past two years there has allowed me access to opportunities I didn't have before. Learning from experts in the industry and getting hands-on experience makes LIM unique."
College Sophomore,5,"All majors require three internships to be completed before graduating, which really helps to get real-world experience. I'm a fashion merchandising major, like most students here, and I've found the classes to be really interesting and insightful. It also helps to know that what you're learning is going to be useful."
College Freshman,5,"When I first chose this school I was fearful that I would want to transfer to parsons or the Fashion Institute but when I began going to school I fell in love with the campus, students, and atmosphere. I enjoyed being a part of the styling club and meeting alumni they were very helpful in reassuring my comfort level at LIM. I am both blessed to attend this school and hopeful for the future and what this school will bring me."
College Sophomore,5,They truly care about you and your future. They put everything they can into making sure you feel at home and comfortable in their environment.
College Sophomore,5,Class registration is an easy process.
College Sophomore,5,It is great. A lot of internship/volunteer opportunities are available and also required to fulfill your degree.
College Freshman,5,"There is a complete gym in the resident's hall, library on campus"
College Sophomore,5,They transferred most of my credits!
College Sophomore,5,I have never had a problem getting into a class I wanted
College Sophomore,5,"Fashion merchandising is a great major in this school because it is a specialized school for the business of fashion,"
College Sophomore,5,There are always job fairs and guest speakers from the industry and also that are alumni that come and speak. Internships must be completed which gives motivation to the students
College Sophomore,5,Career center is very good and has a lot of knowledge
College Junior,5,"The library is excellent.  There are catalogs, books, and lots of information necessary for personal use and projects etc."
College Freshman,5,I dont have any complaints about the campus resources. The staff is very helpful.
College Freshman,5,"LIM doesn't have sports. But every week you will get an e-mail of event happening that week. $8 Movie Tickets, Lectures, Event, Internships, Fashion Shows, etc."
College Senior,5,"What I love most about this school is that they give you the proper resources to get your dream job someday. I have completed two internships thusfar. As a fashion merchandising major, I have been able to work in luxury sales environments as well as in publications at a magazine. Although there are required courses for particular majors, students can choose concentrations. Concentrations enable you to take electives that may not be related to your chosen major. Overall, you will graduate as a knowledgable and well-rounded professional."
College Senior,5,"There is no other college in the greater New York City area that ensures that their students receive both a professional experience and an education at the same time. We are required to complete a total of three internships by the end of our college career. This is vital because in the fashion industry it is not always what you know; who you know can be just as important. These internships enable us to build lasting relationships with employers that may lead to opportunities after graduation. The professors and other staff members have contributed to my success here at LIM College because of their attentiveness to my needs. In fact, many professors have worked as industry professionals themselves. This makes the curriculum applicable to everyday life."
College Sophomore,5,"Since I am working now, the times of the classes that I have chosen are very flexible for my working hours. I will take classes in the morning then work nights."
College Sophomore,5,My financial aid at LIM College was the best. Everything went smooth and they gave me everything i asked for.
College Sophomore,5,This school is so amazing. Everyone is so helpful. No one is mean. The campus is in Manhattan and I love a city that never sleeps. I enjoy everything about this school. I am glad i transferred.
College Senior,5,Loving My Expirience – Here at LIM College I have recieved many opportunities and expiriences that I believe I could not have gotten at any other college. I got to spend the last 3 years in New York City and expirience the fashion industry first hand. Ive made a lot of friends that have the same interests as me and we are very involved with student life.
College Sophomore,5,"Nothing Negative to Say – So far, LIM has made it very easy to transfer, receive all the help I need, give advice, and answer questions. I have received several letters from LIM describing what LIM and New York City has to offer. There are always ways to get in touch with someone in the academic office if I should have any questions. Everyone I talked to was friendly and encouraging. I honestly have nothing negative to say about LIM as of yet."
Junior,4,I love LIM. The location of the buildings is perfect and you get a great hands on experience. Most professor are people who work and the industry so you learn a lot and can build relationships. Most students are friendly. Only down fall is the price.
Junior,4,The point of going to LIM is to have hands on experience and be in NYC. The school is trying its best with the online learning but I personally do not like it.
Senior,4,Online classes are great but very time consuming. Moving to all online during the Covid-19 pandemic was a challenge.
Freshman,4,"The college is probably one of the best fashion/business schools in New York, their facilities are amazing and the teachers know exactly what they’re talking about, so the academics are an absolute 10/10"
Sophomore,4,"I just recently transferred to LIM and every interaction I have had with staff and students has been great! LIM is a much smaller school compared to other Manhattan colleges, with around 1500 students. This ensures you get the most attention from your professors because class sizes are kept small. The internship opportunities are amazing and will benefit students on their educational journey."
Senior,4,"I really enjoy the school I like the New York scene and everything. I enjoy living in the dorms and making new friends. However, some of the curriculum is tough and some of the professors are not the nicest. A lot of the faculty is bad at getting back to you when you email them about something so it requires constant emails in order for them to answer."
Sophomore,4,LIM College is definitely a good fashion school to attend. Internships are required which is good because they want you to get experience. The teachers know what there teaching and give you there thoughts about the fashion industry.
Freshman,4,So far I don't have so much to say about LIM College since I'm still just a freshmen but I am satisfied and liking LIM so far and having great experiences with my professors and classes. Its a great school for fashion business.
Senior,4,"I would like to see improvements in the price of the dorms! It costs almost as much as tuition just to be babysat and have to share a room with other people. The school is not diverse not even by a longshot. Overall, I enjoyed my college experience but I wish I never lived at the dorms."
Junior,4,"Very good academics and professors cares about you. Can also include more tracks to help find better interests and also some design elements. Very helpful with finding an internship or job and offers many opportunities. 
The dorms are horrible, we should we more based on the amount of money we pay."
Freshman,4,"LIM college is a also good for people who are interested in being in the fashion industries when it comes to business. I've enjoyed the facilities there and how much I can spend time with all lot of people there and you can make friends there easily! You can join an internship there and you get better connections with different brand companies including, Macy's and more.."
Freshman,4,"LIM College has endless possibilities. I went in very nervous about being in a competitive environment but couldn't be happier about where I stand now. LIM makes you feel like family and provides many connections to jobs, internships, and activities. The professors care immensely about every students passion in the fashion profession. There are an abundance of people around all the time to help you with any questions. Another plus is the campus is of course New York City leaving the world at your finger tips. However, one downside may be there is no dinning hall. You are going to have to grocery shop or eat out all the time. Many people look down upon this. My personal experience here has been nothing but positive and I am thrilled to continue my journey here at LIM."
College Senior,4,"I like the online aspect, but it can get confusing if not guided through it correctly.  A lot more work is assigned via online, so that can get heavy, but I prefer online rather in class for convenience reasons."
College Senior,4,"LIM College has been a great experience, but there are a lot of areas for improvement, like any school.  It's really amazing that our professors aren't just professors, but they're people currently active in the fashion industry.  I've gained a lot of connections with my professors that will further my career in the coming future.  You can look to them not only for guidance but also experiences, a lot of them will take you on expeditions or introduce you to people they know or other areas where they work."
College Sophomore,4,"Since the International Business program started last year, the amount of students in my major is really small. Despite this, we have all come together and bonded over our major-specific courses. All of my professors have been genuinely interested in what we want to do and work towards making the subject material relevant. I've also earned work and internship experience that I would have never had if I had not attended this college."
College Junior,4,Even after you graduate the school invites you to career events that the school hosts.
College Junior,4,We do get a lot of job opportunities at LIM. Many of my friends from other school tell me wish they chose a more specific school like LIM that could bring them closer to their career goal.
College Junior,4,My major is fashion merchandising and it is one of the two most common majors at my school. The other most common major is  fashion marketing. Some aspects of the program that I don't like are all the CAD and photoshop courses. My school as a whole provides a lot of opportunities for us students to apply for jobs.
College Junior,4,Having a social life at LIM college is not easy. I have made a few friends at school but most of my friends are people i have met through other friends that go to colleges near my home. Because my school is so career focused you end up feeling like you are not doing  enough most of the time in comparison to other students.
College Sophomore,4,"LIM has given me great volunteer and work experiences! I've worked at fashion week, beauty events, and even found my current job through our LIM-exclusive job database. The professors are also really awesome and helpful. They like to get to know students individually."
College Freshman,4,"during orientation, my advisor carefully walked me through the registration process and advised which courses would be best"
College Freshman,4,"LIM offers lots of opportunities with internships and part-time employment..Because we are a small school highly recognized in the fashion industry, many of friends are employed in high-end retail store or major fashion publications..The career center is constantly sending out career opportunity emails."
College Freshman,4,"Being of a school of 1500 students, you really get an opportunity to interact with the professors..Failure is not an option for them..They will work hard with you until you get it"
College Freshman,4,Attending the school has broaden my opportunities in the fashion industry..I had no idea the various careers availabile
College Freshman,4,"I was a little nervous about attending school in the city..I was not accustomed to traveling on the train..The first week of orientation, the counselors dissolved all of my fears..The First Year Experience Class was so HELPFUL..The professors are true professionals in the industry and understands what it takes to make it"
College Senior,4,Great chance to meet people & learn within industry
College Sophomore,4,Many credits were not taken into consideration.
College Sophomore,4,Professors are great and very knowledgable of the field.
College Sophomore,4,Everything about the school and the things it offers for students are great.
College Sophomore,4,I have taken many online courses at LIM so far. I love the online courses and how easy it is to choose them.
College Sophomore,4,"Many options and emails,letters, etc to learn about graduate schools as well as the graduate program at my school."
College Sophomore,4,"Great campus resources, a lot of centers and great technology to help with any school related activities."
College Freshman,4,"so many activities, very great atmosphere and I enjoy my years"
College Freshman,4,This is the first time taking an online course and it features.  I find it very easy and the assistance I receive from m profession help if needed.
College Freshman,4,There is a diverse level of students at school. They come from all around the world and I love getting to meet people who are from diverse backgrounds.
College Freshman,4,All of the teachers have experience in the buissness and still work in the fashion field and offer internships for students and graduated students who have jobs in the industry offer internships when they visit
College Junior,4,We have computers ready to use anywhere in the building and lounges. LIM has a great library as well librarians that will help the student with any help they need. Another good resource is the extra help/tutor we receive from the school.
College Junior,4,"I come from a single parent family that doesn't have that much to provide for a full college experience, such as being a ble to dorm. However with the help minor help of the school it eased the financial stress in our home by a little bit. My mother was able to provide 1/3 of the tuition for i told her that i will take loans. I didn't want to leave all the bills to her."
College Junior,4,I like the school mainly because it's in Manhattan. Besides that i enjoy the teachers as well because most of them have worked in the industry already and have outside knowledge to provide during lectures. The workload is reasonable and bearable enough to not cause stress. The buildings are scattered around and have multiple resources if students decide to use them. I enjoy the way teachers show that they really want to help because i've talked to some and they've already tried to get me in the industry.
College Junior,4,I'm happy with my choice to go to LIM. The professors are nice and knowledgable and can guide us in the right direction.
College Junior,4,The school requires students to have internships so that the students abstract to gain real world experience which is what I like most.
College Junior,4,"I am pleased with my experience with the professors and courses. There is a diverse background of professors as far as age, ethnicity, and career paths so you get a lot of feedback in different aspects."
College Junior,4,The topics and curriculum is very diverse in each class and isn't repetitive.
College Junior,4,I like that all my teachers have different experiences and careers in the industry currently so they are aware of what is going on now in the industry.
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of resources for the students to use including library, computer labs, math lab, writing center and there's a gym at the doorms open to all students."
College Junior,4,when ever i am in need of help or assistance someone is always willing to help.
College Sophomore,4,This school is great if you want to work in the fashion industry.
College Sophomore,4,"Student body is mostly girls but diverse, but it is easy to express yourself because it is a fashion based school."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are very smart and always offering help to those that need it, there is also a math center and a writing center"
College Sophomore,4,Professors are usually in the industry and are very helpful
College Junior,4,The professors have industry experience.
College Junior,4,"Entering the school only half of my credits were accepted but I managed to get into a groove.

The school tests your limits with classes and internship/job opportunities. 

Every semester I was kept busy with both a job and/or classes.

It was beneficial."
College Junior,4,I've never had a problem with the network or wireless access.  Printing has always been quick and steady.
College Junior,4,Your professors/advisors are industry experts.
College Junior,4,LIM College is a great resource for those looking for internships and jobs post-graduate.
College Freshman,4,My school offers 4 majors and you will have to complete 3 internships in each.
College Freshman,4,I love the location of my school because it is in the heart of New York City is surrounded by the fashion industry.
College Freshman,4,I love how my school prepares us for the industry and how the professors want us to learn everything we can. I wish the workload wasnt as heavy and the class times were shorter.
College Freshman,4,My professor was very helpful and made sure we knew how to use the software.
College Sophomore,4,"Any school has its ups and downs, but overall I love this school. It's difficult to get answers sometimes, but thats a small factor in your college experience. I love that the curriculum doesn't always come directly from a textbook. Our professors really focus on the real world experiences that we will be likely to endure. I believe they prepare us best for reality rather than studying a couple terms and methods we learn about real business and people."
Junior,2,"This is my first module at LIM College. I believe the positive reviews for this college are entered here by LIM staff. I was really excited to attend LIM College. Now, I'm scared of staying there. I am an online student. I am taking 3 classes right now. They do not tell you that these are accelerated classes and have 3 times the work of a normal class. I have had on average 12-15 assignments to complete each week, taking up to 9 hours to complete. The professors create their own assignments and I feel I would be learning more if I did the assignments in the textbook. In one class, it was mostly discussions of opinion and never any real facts."
Alum,2,"LIM College did not meet my expectations whatsoever. I was extremely disappointed in the lack of attention to students, especially for a small school."
Works Here,2,"If you are a bright student, you may not be challenged. The admissions criteria is low therefore the classroom makeup of the students is average to below average intelligence. The courses are not very rigorous and grade point averages run high to maintain the graduation rate. Heard of Trump U?"
Freshman,2,"I go to LIM and it's definitely not the experience I was looking for. If you want a traditional college experience this is by no means meant for you. The dorms are way over priced for what they I are and I would highly suggest getting an apartment. The classes are super easy and feel like high school. Also, if you like guys under the age of 30 this is isn't the college for you because the guys at clubs are all sleazy business men "
College Junior,2,"Do not attend LIM if you want a full college experience. If you enjoy NYC nightlife, relying on annoying promoters to get you in, and hanging out with older men then this is the ""college experience"" for you. If you want a school that has school spirit, sports, Greek life and a huge campus don't go to this school you'll end up disappointed. I attended this school in hopes of getting the best out of the fashion world but didn't get what I expected. 30% of my freshman class transferred after their first semester here. Also credits don't transfer out! Being it's a private school a bunch of the classes are made up courses by the school that will not transfer to any other university. Most of the professors are extremely helpful but others are just here to receive a little extra income and could care less about your education and helping you succeed. LIM tries their best to make the college fun but they fail miserable. The student activity coordinators are run by 20-30 year olds that couldn't find a real job after graduating and think trips to the wax museum are what we want to do. A few girls tried to start a sorority and the dean shut us down. He told us the school wants us involved in fashion oriented clubs only and there's no time for a sorority with what our schedules are supposed to be like. We started a club called the LIM socialites, due to the fact we weren't a real sorority no one wanted to commit and the club failed after a semester. You're required three internships before you graduate but what the college fails to tell you is that you need to take 15+ credits while interning. They also try to screw you into taking less credits your freshman year and now a majority of my class is behind on credits are struggling with 19+ credits a semester to graduate on time. The financial aid office is not helpful at all. It could take you over a week to get in touch with someone. I've also heard from alumni that employers don't necessarily like LIM students. i hate LIM(:"
College Junior,2,"You will either have fantastic professors with great industry experience, or professors that should not be employed at all."
College Junior,2,"As I spoke of in my last review section, dealing with the financial aid process can be a headache because the school doesn't contact you about updates for your financial aid. And they sometimes take a long time to return your call which can be annoying if it's an urgent matter."
College Junior,2,They charge additional fees. Example registration fees and if you are late for registration they charge a late fee.
College Freshman,2,I dont feel the scholarships and grants given by the school are adequate to the cost of tuition.
College Senior,2,"The curriculum is disappointing as I have mentioned before because I transferred into this school with an Associates Degree and only 21 credits transferred. The curriculum also is more than a 4 year program, incoming new freshman have to take at least 15 credits or so (around there) before they can actually begin the 4 year program. It is almost impossible to graduate from LIM in 4 years and I believe they do this on purpose. However, I have been taking no less than 18 credits a semester AND also taking summer courses this summer so I hope to graduate in 2.5/3 years here. Even by doing the maximum school work possible, they still make it difficult to graduate in 4 years or under. My academic experience has been graded a C because I have learned plenty of knowledge going here but I feel as though the workload they put on you (or you put on yourself so you aren't thousands of dollars in debt from graduating in 6 years) is more than I would've hoped for."
College Senior,2,"The flexibility at LIM college is about average. Not all of my credits transferred from my previous associates degree which was incredibly disappointing. However, I do understand that this is a fashion school and not a general college. Scheduling my classes has been about average as well. Some courses have been difficult to get into or organize my schedule so I can also work part time. Some classes are only offered on certain days that don't work in my current working situation, but I understand that is typical for any institution."
College Senior,2,"LIM College is a private school. Students coming from middle-class households would find it to be quite expensive. Every year I have a constant dilemma of finding loans to cover tuition and additional expenses. I have my own apartment. The cost of living in NYC rises annually. I can barely afford textbooks even while working at a high-end retailer. I will be paying off student loans for the rest of my life. In order to pay for this school stress-free, your parents must be rich or have decent credit to assure that you can meet the requirements of lenders. Scholarships will be your best friend. It takes quite some time to receive refund checks as well."
College Junior,2,"majority of white students of wealthy family background, low minority percentage, socialize in groups based on wealth"
College Senior,2,"No Issues – When transferring from a regular university none of my credits transferred except general studies, such as math classes. I didn't have an issue with this because I was previously aware about some credits not transferring."
College Senior,2,"Overall, my experience here has been bittersweet. I had much school spirit when first attending this college, but now after battling with the Financial Aid department for three years I am at wit's end and ready to graduate. The student life is not reflective of the new york life and the schools expenses don't match the lack of support and learning offered at LIM College. You must work very hard and be independent in order to succeed at this school."
College Senior,2,"The college has four buildings. The first has a very small computer section, but the printer always works. The second is medium sized but not large enough for almost every student attends class there. The printer is almost always malfunctioning. In the third building there are enough computers but again, the printer is virtually always not working. In the fourth building the computers and printers work, but that may partly be because the IT department is held in that building. The wireless access is typically difficult to retrieve. The professors have difficulty with the computers as well, which disrupts the class."
College Freshman,2,Supply computer but most of the time the printer is broken
College Freshman,2,"Don't come if you're not in love with fashion – DONT come here if fashion is not your life or your passion. the first semester all of your classes are all about fashion - fashion fundamentals, fashion survey... same class but a different name, such a waste of time. i didn't find out that your ""paid internship"" first semester you have to work on black friday and on christmas eve, so basically you work in the city for a month, no school or anything, great college life right? you won't get a typical college experience here, but you will get amazing opportunities, so if you love  fashion this is the place for you. but if you're not sure if it's what you want, don't waste your time. i transferred and know of a lot of people that have and i don't regret it at all, i don't know how i would have survived. not to mention, during orientation the dean said that only 65% of us will be back in january, and she did not make me feel welcome whatsoever.

oh, and some of the people here take fashion way too seriously and are snobby. "
College Freshman,2,"Not Related to Business – I came to LIM thinking there would be more classes related to marketing and business, and most of the classes are all about fashion. If you're mainly interested in fashion, this is the place for you. However, if you feel that you want to go into mainly business, look at other schools."
College Sophomore,2,"My school isn't very diverse. Its mainly all girls because of the majors  LIM offers. Im not happy with the people I have to go to school with they come off very nasty and everyone is very cut throat. I don't like the constant competition. I feel like if LIM offered more majors, different people would apply and want to attend this school."
Freshman,1,This school is a literal joke. You spend so much money for a high school class. I was challenged more in high school. The financial aid office is ran buy students who don't know anything. There's this lady that works in there and she is so rude but straightened up when my mom cursed her out. The girls here are wannabe Carrie Bradshaw's and are so caught up in themselves and are not serious about their work.
Junior,1,"The professors don’t know what they are doing.. no one really makes friends because everyone is caught up in “themselves” and there vanity. Over priced tuition because it is a for-profit school, doesn’t help get a job.. classes are repeatative"
Junior,1,"OK, so It was between LIM & FIT. The only reason why I decided to go to LIM was that they took most of my credits. BUT the tuition is NOT worth it! You pay so much and they still charge you extra for a ""late"" fee when you already had paid before the deadline. Their offices are SHADY. Staff quits about a semester later b/c they realize how shady it is. None of the professors or students know what they're doing! How unprofessional is it? My community college was better than this. LIM is a shame and ruined my fashion experience. SMH they like to delay your process even more by making you take stupid POINTLESS classes. They want you to spend as much money as you can and walk out of there like you learned NOTHING. PLEASE STAY AWAY. I was already supposed to be graduated by now but NOPE. they love taking my money and making me take stupid classes. RUN!"
Works Here,1,"I worked at the College and left as I no longer felt comfortable strategizing on ways to attract revenue/students from young men and women who are not cut out for a four year institution. The curriculum is not rigorous and the majors are created to appeal to students who want to be stylists or event planners; careers surely not needing to be founded in an expensive 4-year, for profit, institution. At the end of the day, it's a rich woman who owns the College and the students' tuition goes into her pocket. The acceptance rate is very high and the GPA's are high too...to attract more students and keep the cycle going."
Graduate Student,1,"The only thing good about this school is its location. The administration has no family values. When they look at the student all they see is a $ sign. They allow all internationals who cannot speak a word of English and those students suffer through their entire education. LIM College supports alcohol consumption every chance possible. Their ""Family night"" theme was a night in Las Vegas where the students and faculty and staff  were pressured to drink until they lose their heads and gamble the little money that they have in their pocket. They get students drunk so that they think the school is cool! This is a note to parents: Do not send your child to LIM College. The academic rigor is very low and the students pay truck loads of money to get a diploma and find jobs that barely pay $30,000. They have zero respect for Muslims, Sikhs, or any nations beyond US borders."
Alum,1,I can not give a lower rating than one star. LIM has Poorly designed courses without any research done. Only 40% professors are worth listing to and subjects do not match to the course offered. They take the money and do not offer any valuable learning. Upon raising the issue they would drag it to months and will not provide any solution. This college is an utter waste of time and money. If you are serious about your career then do not opt to go for this college. The management is never helpful. They will listen to you but will not help you at any cost. Students leave the college with a bad experience and the college does not care about it.
Sophomore,1,"I went to LIM in 2006.  I was only there for one semester.  This was the WORST school experience I have ever had. This school is full of pretentious, spoiled children who are paying BIG BUCKS to make no more than 50k upon graduating.  None of these credits transfer.  I repeat- NONE OF THESE CREDITS TRANSFER.  If you have parents that are willing to pay your way through school and you live in Manhattan or close to the city and want a school with no character and shallow personalities- then this is for you!  You will NOT get the 'college experience' here.  You need to go to a private or state university for that.  The staff was half nice- half not so nice.  Some of them aligned with the snobbish attitudes of their students.  So if you identify with that- then again, this school may be for you!  I particularly recall this older woman with shoulder length brown hair (she had to be about 70 at the time- she may have passed by now) who was SO rude and demeaning."
Alum,1,"I will never, ever recommend this school to ANYONE that wants to learn or do well in school. The teachers are unqualified, the school consistently  take money from you and leave you NO choice but to pay it or you won't be allowed to graduate, register for classes, basically do anything. I was in that school 2 years longer than I was supposed to because academic counselors who weren't sure how to do their jobs properly, put me in classes I didn't even need and told me after the fact that I basically just wasted money. Unless you're already rich with a connection into the fashion industry, do not, i repeat....DO NOT let this school take your money. You will regret it.  Do not let the cool vibe of the locations fool you.  I am STILL being charged for holds on my account and I haven't attended that school in OVER A YEAR. "
College Junior,1,"As a fashion scholar, I was expected to take honors level courses AND work/intern.  BUT, LIM never offered my MANDATORY honors courses during times that would allow me to work or intern and was thus forced to intern over the summer, while LIM was unwilling to pay for my rent or credits required to receive academic credit for my MANDATORY internships."
College Junior,1,Terrible waste of time and money.  To hear every day that none of the students are happy with the school and yet are unwilling to transfer demonstrates the type of people that applied to LIM are afraid of change.
College Junior,1,I have never been more miserable in my life until coming to this school.  I value my education above anything else and clearly LIM does not.
College Junior,1,Online professors are terribly rude and clearly do not understand the system used for online courses.  The courses are not structured well and the learning is completely dependent on reading the textbook.
College Junior,1,There is absolutely no school spirit.  It is terrible going to a school where the students hate learning.
College Junior,1,"FINANCIAL SERVICES IS BY FAR THE WORST DEPARTMENT AT LIM.  Every semester they forgot to apply my Fashion Scholar scholarship, and always had confusion over my payment play.  Also, apply for additional scholarships is futile since LIM does not give out money to people who need financial aid.  They are also unable to use FAFSA fairly.  A fellow student had an issue with FAFSA because her parents were divorced; while her twin brother's school was able to understand the difference and give him financial aid, LIM was completely unable to understand that the divorce of the biological parents meant that the LIM student was really only receiving half of the financials posted in the FAFSA and tax forms."
College Junior,1,"Career management facilities actually hinders your ability to get your foot in the door.  The system they have in place completely ruins your ability to set yourself apart from other students.  All resumes used to apply to jobs or internships through the school's database must be in the same format.  I have come across several employers, both small companies and large corporations, that feel as though LIM students are stupid, and do not think the same resume for every student is a good idea for any industry, let alone the fashion industry."
College Junior,1,"As a management major, several of the management professors were great.  However, if you are not in the Fashion Scholars program, be prepared for lower than high school level education."
College Junior,1,"In theory, LIM is a great school with fantastic opportunities to gain experience within the industry.  However, in application, LIM is clearly a business school that does not know how to run a business.  The degree is not worth the paper it is printed on.  There are several required courses that are out of date, repetitive, and certainly not useful for any level of college education."
College Senior,1,"I received my Associates Degree at a State University prior to attending LIM College. Though I am very happy at LIM, I feel that the tuition is ridiculously priced. I understand that this college is a private institution so automatically it is more expensive, along with the fact that the campus is spread all throughout Manhattan. However, I still believe for all of the classes we are required to take, I sometimes feel it is not worth the 23,000 dollars I am paying every year. The tuition also went up this current year which is very hard to understand. I have taken a few courses in my first year that I honestly did see as a waste of time. However, the connections that LIM is able to help you with and networking is outstanding. I believe my money is going towards that moreso than the education, therefore I grade it as a D."
Recent Alumnus,1,LIM overall stressed me out. Its unorganized and not very flexible. I would have much rather attended a different college. LIM is very one dimensional and not very flexible. I was not very impressed with its operational skills and they are making transferring very difficult.
College Sophomore,1,People were not very nice. If you did not make friends the first day your out of luck.

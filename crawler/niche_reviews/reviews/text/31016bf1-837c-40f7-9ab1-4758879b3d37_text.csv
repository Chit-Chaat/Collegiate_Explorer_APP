Sophomore,5,I have not had any classes online so far. I am sure it it like the rest of the classes awesome. Everything is just great at BPC
Sophomore,5,A great family oriented college. You feel like you are at home. A strong Christian school with great academics and sports.
Freshman,5,Currently a freshman here and I personally like it because it is a small college and it is mostly all student athletes here.
Junior,5,"Brewton-Parker is such a great school. All the employees are very nice and are determined to help students. The teachers are understanding and teach well, and the classes are small. This is nice because the teachers get to know each and every student. The campus is very diverse which is great as well."
Niche User,5,I visited Brewton-Parker while exploring my college choices. The school is nice in size and there is a great cultural/ethnic diversity level. The staff member are nice and were eager to tell me all the benefits of attending their school.
Sophomore,5,"I have been at Brewton College for over a year now. As soon as I registered for school or visited for open college day, I was greeted from all personnel staff the first day and they all remembered me from day 1. Everyone at Brewton are exceptionally nice and willing to help with any issues that students may encounter. The only thing I would like to see is the housing upgrade change for all students."
Freshman,5,I really liked that it was small enough but big enough. I wasnt just another number. It was more personal and I will have more one on one teacher experiences.
Freshman,5,"There is such a family atmosphere here! While the campus and numbers are small, the spirit is big. I love the feeling of being on the beautiful campus, and all of the staff are all so helpful through all the processes."
Sophomore,5,Brewton Parker College is where I have found my life long friendship and the building of my relationship with Christ. The education is Bible-based and that is exactly what I wanted in a school. The only thing they need to change is they need to update the campus.
Freshman,5,Small class size and professors take an interest in their students success. Students and administrators are very friendly and helpful making it feel like a family.
Freshman,5,"I love how it is a small close-knit school, they really care about you and your academic success. They are extremely organized and prompt on returning your emails or calls."
Freshman,5,"I honestly wouldn't want anything to change about this school. All of the administrators and students are very friendly and helpful. When I went to the New Student Registration (NSR), almost everybody knew my name and I felt so comfortable being there. It gives you such a good vibe being at Brewton-Parker College. I just love the school overall, it's actually fun and better than what people expected because it's a Christian College. The outside of the dorm buildings may look old but the inside of them are updated. At most colleges, students have to pay to wash their laundry but at Brewton-Parker guess what? It's free."
Freshman,5,"Brewton Parker College was not shy at all in extending a warm, firm hand to me. The campus is certainly vibrant, and I could not express my love for it enough! My faith in Christ and passion for music has led me to this culturally diverse school,  and I certainly plan to pursue a degree in Music Ministry. I couldn't change a thing about this college, and I hope it continues to grow."
Sophomore,5,"I am attending Brewton Parker college after going to Valdosta State, and it is much different. Brewton Parker is a lot smaller so the professors and president is more involved and personal with all the students. The campus is also small and located in a rural place so it feels really homely to me because of where I grew up. I would recommend this school to anyone who enjoys the outdoors meeting new people and someone who is searching for something different than the usually college experience."
Freshman,5,"Brewton Parker is a christian college, its different from any other college. Its there for students who wants to find god and themselves. The staff at Brewton Parker offer students a chance to build a relationship with them and god."
College Junior,5,"My school has a great athletic department, and most students that attend are there on athletic scholarships.  School spirit is great, it could be better, but no one really complains."
College Sophomore,5,The schools will leave you with a smile no matter how bad of a day you may have! From the friemdly people to the beautiful campus!
College Junior,5,"We have alot of diversity through ethnicity and beliefs. There are alot of freindly people that are fun to hang out with without alot of drama, you just have to find them. If you choose your freinds wisely you'll be alright and you could actually have a good time."
College Freshman,5,"Brewton-Parker College is a Christian School. So, it is appropriate that there are no clubs or bars around. As for parties on campus, there are none that possess alcohol or any type of drug. I love this because I can focus on my education and relationship with God."
College Freshman,5,The biology program at Brewton-Parker College is everything I hoped it to be. We have professors here who have taught the parents of my peers. I love this because I know I am getting an excellent education with the best professors around.
Freshman,4,"I have not yet attended as a student, but I am very excited and have heard great things about Brewton Parker."
Sophomore,4,It is a beautiful campus with amazing teachers who help students strive to do their very best while having christ in their lives.
Sophomore,4,It's small and I get to be involved in a lot of things. The professors know my name and help me. It's very easy to find things to get involved with.
Sophomore,4,I like Brewton-Parker College because it really focuses on academics and a very flexible because most students over there are athletes. You get to know everybody because its a small college with like 800 students maximum. I like cause the classroom sizes are pretty small and there is great interaction with your teacher.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Brewton Parker College has been one to remember. I met many intelligent, loving people and have grown closer to God. The professors, coaches, and staff are very close and helpful with the students. However, if I had to change one thing it would be to widen the major availability."
College Student,4,I love the atmosphere and the dorms .
College Student,4,"I play for the athletics , and it's very great."
College Student,4,"I love them dorms , and I love the social life."
College Sophomore,4,"Though they work very slowly, it's still good"
College Junior,4,"I really like the atmosphere, and the students are nice.  The location is nice and quaint, but if you're looking for the big college-town feel then it's not for you.  I love that athletics are a big focus, and our teams are really good."
College Sophomore,4,I am personally not very involved in sports on campus. I have heard only good things about them from other students who are involved. 
College Sophomore,4,"Most students come for sports, some sports do better than others but, overall everyone is better each year. Workouts are intense and vary every time you go to team workouts. Most of the teams are well diverse in ethnicity but, also in nationality. Each team has a certain trainer they see. Most teams are like brother/sisterhoods, but we all come together to support each other and work together to strive for more."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is nothing special but, the teachers here will do almost anything to insure your success. They try their best to answer all questions you have about the course work. They treat you with the upmost respect, the teachers go out of their way to build a personal relationship with each and every student. Most will call you when you do not show up to class and will come and help you after business ours if that what it takes to get you to pass their class."
College Freshman,4,"There are not many options for off-campus housing at Brewton-Parker College. There are some apartments that are quite inexpensive but there are not a lot of them, making it difficult to find one available. I do not find this so be an issue because the dorms on campus are completely sufficient and an overall fun experience."
College Freshman,4,"The most popular program at Brewton-Parker College is without a doubt the biology program. I am going to this school for biology and I find it very enticing and enjoyable here on this campus. The size of classes are smaller than average colleges, making it easy to bond with professors and allowing them to be accessible for students who need extra help."
College Sophomore,4,I am a new student at Brewton-Parker. The only drug use i have seen is smoking; and it was one time. The school is good so far in my eyes.
College Freshman,4,"The baseball players are the most clique-ish group ever! All other sports players are friendly, but the baseball team will only even talk to you if you are a hot girl! Everyone else is super easy to talk to."
College Senior,4,"I can't really speak to the on-campus attitude toward diversity since I am an external student.  My classes are online.  However, I have dealt with the faculty and students through online interaction for the past three years.  I can say with no reservation that I have interacted with students from several countries, and have been no underlying tension or animosity toward these students.  The school is a Baptist school, and as such, I have seen a very censored approach to disagreements in that they are handled with more of a Christian attitude than my two previous schools.  It's been nice to know the students and faculty are committed to a Christ-like attitude in resolving their differences and interacting on a daily basis."
College Sophomore,4,Low Tolerance – My school does not tolerate inappropiate behavior. The rules are forced.
College Sophomore,4,"Always Can Find Some Fun – Brewton Parker is located in a town named Mount Vernon. Mount Vernon is a very small yet peaceful and quite town. Almost 15 mins away is a town named Vidalia, which is like the city compared to Mt. Vernon. In the town there are movie theatres and bowling alleys which is a lot of fun."
College Junior,2,"It's in a small town, so there is really nothing to do off-campus unless you feel like driving at least an hour."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much Variety – The food is good, but is very limited. There is not much choice in the cafeteria, you can either have what they serve, pizza, or salad. There are very few places outside of campus to choose from when going out to eat."
College Senior,2,"As I am an external student at BPC, my primary interactions have only been with other business majors.  The workload is much easier and laid-back than my previous schools. While I appreciate not having to make a major effort to complete my courses, I don't feel I am being truly challenged or prepared for my future career."
College Junior,1,"We don't have any transportation vehicles , unless your an athlete and you have to go out of town for a game. So if you need to take a trip off campus to the store or anywhere else you would need your own vehicle."
College Freshman,1,"Turn Back While You Still Have Time – The scenery sucks. There is nothing to do here and not much to look at, except the same old antiquated medium-sized buildings. The nearest Walmart is 10 miles away. The main things that you come across within a 8 mile radius would be a lot Texas Chainsaw Massacre-looking trailer parks....The Ultimate Hillbilly Heaven!"
College Junior,1,"Brewton-Parker is unique in the sense that we barely have any programs that cater to the students on campus. Every weekend you can count on another boring day at BPC. There is so much drama at our tiny school, its like highschool all over again. It is very annoying seeing the same people over and over again because everybody knows your business. We are college students that have lame rules like, specific days for male and female visitation in the dorm rooms, and when in those rooms two people cannot be on the same bed but one person on the chair and the other on the floor, the door has to be open and the light has to be on. They have these dorm rules hoping to prevent students from having sex, but students continue to have sex throughout the campus. We also have a 1 o'clock curfew each week. The school has unnecessary rules that needs to be changed. The social scene is nonexistent because there is no where to go and there is so much restrictions to hang out with members of the opposite sex. The class sizes are phenomenal. Each class contains 12-24 students which gives students a chance to talk one on one with the professors."

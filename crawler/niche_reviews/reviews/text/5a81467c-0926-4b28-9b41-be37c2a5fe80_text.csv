I appreciate how nice everyone has been so far, they are always willing to help out."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed the ability to work talk and work with other students around not only the United States but the world. Their only courses give the availability to learn and get opinions from people in different states and regions then what I might just experience in Iowa. I am a student of the Waterloo Center and the staff at the center was nothing but wonderful and helpful. The President and his wife, Bill and Sharon Duffy, are nothing but wonderful people who are proud of their students!"

Freshman,5,"I am a freshman here and so far this school is very hands on I’ve decided to take online classes and they have been there to support me all the way through they have so many different ways to help you succeed and I love that. I think the only thing I would change is they need a bookstore on site because I’m not at the main campus, so I know it would help me and so many others to not have to order online that’s difficult at times."
Junior,5,I love the flexible schedules. The advisory office is always helpful. Upper iowa has various programs. Students are able to juggled fulltime employment and college courses.  The college online platform is very user friendly. Students feel very motivated while studying.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the atmosphere at Upper Iowa University. It's a small community, so all the students know each other. The small campus is easy to get around, and it has great new facilities. The business school is top notch with nice professors who are flexible with student's busy schedules."

Freshman,5,"I am an adult learner, going back after leaving college 20 years ago.  I love the class availability online or on campus. They are attentive, making sure that if you need help you get it. Teachers make themselves available for students, tutoring online 24/7 for math and in person on campus. You can even tutor via skype. They care about their students."
Junior,5,I love the small college atmosphere. I have met my best friends there and the education there is amazing.
Junior,5,"As a active Army, I can take classes online or in class. If I move I can still take classes through their many  locations . The professors are very understanding of the military crazy schedules. They work with us when it come to homework / classworknwe missed. Over all I love that upper Iowa is military friendly and they care to see us succeed ."
Senior,5,Upper Iowa University has been fitting for me and proven to be one of the best decisions I've made. From the Milwaukee WI center I have enjoyed classroom instruction from a great faculty team. The Fayette staff often seem like they are right next door and all avenues of student support has been great. Online courses are taught by Fayette campus faculty too and the standard of excellent instruction was consistent in the classroom and online.
Sophomore,5,"Everyone from financial aide to the advisers have been amazing and super helpful! I am taking online classes, and all of the advisers and instructors have been very easy to communicate with and they all take the time to talk you through whatever you may be asking. I think that their cost is average, but you are getting a private college education. Upper Iowa also offers an different approach to semesters, offering ""sessions"" so you take your classes in eight weeks. I take two classes each eight weeks, thirty three per school year."
Freshman,5,"I just started classes this month. I am enjoying taking classes here. It was easy to get my classes set up, and I really like my instructors."
Freshman,5,"Small class sizes, friendly atmosphere and great athletic programs!  Excellent food, suites and a short walk to down town."
Freshman,5,It was a really easy application process and my academic advisor is really helpful and always available.
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed my experience on the campus of Upper Iowa. Every staff and student is very open and friendly to me. I can't wait to be a part of everything during my Junior and senior years of college. The school has many educational and life experience opportunities as well that include float trips and other wild experiences. My favorite part about this school is there are many teaching job opportunities right out of college in the state of Texas. I also get the opportunity to represent the school by playing on the golf team. I am very excited to get underway with the 2nd half of my college education/experience.
Freshman,5,"Upper Iowa University is a great place to meet new people and get a well rounded education. There is a lot of partying, which I don't personally participate in, and it can get a little rowdy around campus sometimes. But, overall I'm happy in my choice of this University"
Junior,5,I am an online student and absolutely love it. The site used for the online program is super easy to use and very organized. The advisors are super helpful as well. I am so happy I am a student here.

Freshman,5,"Financial aid people are great. Student diversity is great. I love having evening classes, doesn't interfere with work."
Freshman,5,At Upper Iowa I had the chance to experience and meet new people at this event called Peacocks Experience. I had a wonderful time in getting to be able to explore and see how my college experience will be here at Upper Iowa.
Sophomore,5,The counselor I spoke with gave me amazing guidance and placed me on a great path for excellence. I am looking forward to attending college at Upper Iowa University. The offer a wide variety of classes that fit what I am looking for since I am extremely busy with military life and the demand it puts on my family of five. I am greatful for finding a college that will work with my schedule and my need for online classes.
Junior,5,"The Waterloo Campus has very helpful staff! Was able to sit down with them to obtain the information that I was looking for. Were able to help me get a discount, that I did not even have a clue about, due to different job places."
Freshman,5,"Upper Iowa University, although it is a small college, the professors are so nice and the small class sizes mean for better learning. The students are really nice and all care about you as a person no matter who you are. Even though the school is in the middle of nowhere the night life is great! I love the women's soccer team and I'm so excited to start in the fall."
Freshman,5,I love Upper Iowa University because faculty really cares about their students. They welcome international students more like any other college I know in the Northeast Iowa.
Niche User,5,"I thought that Upper Iowa campus offers many opportunities through many sports, clubs, and classes. They are always there to help if you need it and very friendly. Great coaches and professors that are there to help you learn not just teach you."
Niche User,5,During my visit at the college was fantastic. If I had enough funds to attend I would pick this college.
Sophomore,5,Upper Iowa University has help me go through my two years of college. They have the right professors and the class sizes are small. This allows students to know the professors a little more than they would in larger classes.
Senior,5,"I really liked how flexible Upper Iowa University is. I was able to take online classes, classes at the Fayette campus as well as classes at the Waterloo center. They were also able to accept my classes from Hawkeye Community College from my Liberal Arts degree as well as my Graphic Communications degree."
College Freshman,5,There are policemen which in every housing system on campus. There are help lines to call in case if assaults. There are punishments and laws against it. Every one has been giving a whistle in case you suspect something bad. Well everyone is super nice and I have not encountered any misbehaving. I feel very secured everyday. And talk shows have been organized to make everyone aware of things like this
College Freshman,5,"It is great to live on campus. The rooms are spacious and has chairs and desks for studying. The social atmosphere is friendly, homely and great. The housing process was easy. The bathrooms and lobbies are very neat. The resident assistants are doing a great job."
College Freshman,5,"The housing is great! The rooms are nice, and big. The residence life is great! Everyone is a family."
College Freshman,5,Upper Iowa is a family I never knew I needed. Everyone is so friendly here. All of the professors and teachers are here for you to succeed. There are so many resources for the student's success. Ask a question and you will get the answer you need as soon as it's found.
College Sophomore,5,Great housing... if you get in a south village or Lee towers. Garbee and Hoffmaster are completely disgusting. Grabee is so outdated and seemingly prison like while Hoffmaster just needs to be torn down!
College Sophomore,5,"since we don't have 'real' greek life, it's more of a find your group of friends and hang out drink and help the community, in frats and some sororities there is a little bit of hazing but NOTHING compared to large state schools."
College Junior,5,The school is wonderful to work with and convenient for individuals who have to work a full-time job and want to further their education. The class sizes are not large so you get to know your classmates and professors/instructors.
College Sophomore,5,It's the best at school .I get to interact with my professors easily and ask questions anytime.Alao campus life is the best .
College Freshman,5,Geek life is amazing on campus! I really didn't really talk to anyone on campus before I join Geek life. Everyone like a big family; I can count on them and they can count on me!
Recent Alumnus,5,There are new buildings for upper class men that are like apartments and we have laundry and other amenities and it is a small campus so it is very nice.
College Junior,5,8 week courses are amazing and it is easier with workload and getting help from professors too!
College Junior,5,People are very trusting on campus and it's rare something bad happens on campus!
College Junior,5,They do whatever they can to help you find where you want to go!
College Junior,5,The classes are very small and you get to know your professors very well and become friends with them!
College Junior,5,"You really can't beat the suite style living at Upper Iowa as the buildings are brand new and being able to have a living room area, a bathroom for your room, and depending on where you live you might have your own room! There are kitchens in each building as well as study rooms."
College Junior,5,Upper Iowa is one of kind.  The staff and professors do whatever they can to help get to where you want to go in your life! You become close with your professors as well as the President of the University.  It's amazing how much they want you to succeed and I am blessed to be able to go there!
College Senior,5,"Easy, affordable and convenient for full-time employees to attend online."
College Freshman,5,Peacocks in all sports had winning seasons.
Freshman,4,I love the small hometown feeling environment of UIU. I may be 3 and a half hours from home but it doesn't feel that far with so many people surrounding me and encouraging me for my future. The teachers get to know you on an individual basis and will check on you even if you miss just one class most the time.
Senior,4,"Upper Iowa University is a well respected university with a lot of opportunities. It may be located in a small town, but it is still a college which allows you to get an education. The people of Upper Iowa are super nice and friendly; that is part of the reason why I am enjoying my time at Upper Iowa. I have not had any issues with safety or security, and it is a very easy college and town to get around. I would like to see an upgrade in food accessibility, and grocery stores. Another highlight of the university are the professors. They are very helpful and understanding during the school year and have made my experience positive."
Junior,4,"I love that this school offers online courses. I work three jobs and cant afford to take time off for schooling. Being able to do all my courses online makes getting my bachelors degree possible. I haven't officially started yet, but I have received a lot of help to get me set up. The center director for the Prairie du Chien center has been a great resource to get me going on the right path."
Sophomore,4,"Upper Iowa University has been so amazing in helping me get started in reaching my goals, my student advisor checks in with me almost weekly and asks if I need anything. I feel confident I chose the right school to help me further my career as well as being able to work around my busy mom life."
Niche User,4,They were great they had lovely campus and it’s a lovely place to be even though there in the middle of a bunch of land and there’s nothing around for miles they keep something for there students to do  they do a lot of activity that are amazing and everything is afodable. There food was good and it’s very diverse and I like it there football team is what I am interested in and there are pretty ok I like there field and it’s all just beautiful I like the school and I fully support everything they do
Freshman,4,"My experience here at Upper Iowa University has been good overall. There are a lot of very nice people on campus and the professors are more than willing to help you with whatever you need assistance with. The food here is decent, but there are other places to go off campus if you don't like the food on campus. Personally since I came from a metropolis area, moving to a rural area has been a major culture shock for me. If you don't have a car, you will be very limited to the amount of places you can go, but luckily the college provides a car rental right in the campus parking lot. Overall, great college."
Junior,4,"I transfer to UIU this last year to obtain my degree and they have been so helpful so far. The instructors help whenever you need it, the class sizes are small enough to allow hands on education. My program is able to do all these outdoor things and allow us to achieve our education."
Freshman,4,"As a first year college freshman at uiu, my experience has been great so far, other than one small issue with a teacher due to her lack of clarification in her teachings."
Senior,4,"I chose Upper Iowa for having my major being offered, the size, scholarship opportunities, and the location. NorthEast Iowa is a beautiful place to be, and the small class class size makes everyone feel like friends and family."
Senior,4,"I'm enrolled in online courses and in person courses at their Madison center. I love UIU, the instructors take time to make sure you know the material. Anth they bring their real life experiences into teaching the subjects."
Freshman,4,"I am a new student at Upper Iowa University. Go Peacocks! However, my experience so far has been excellent. As an adult student(online/offline) I was nervous about the process and hesitant to believe I could actually achieve enrollment status.

Let me tell you what, the advisors and all other staff included have blown my mind with how efficient and easy they made this process. Whatever your student type, UIU will ensure you have the information and resources needed for success in your pursuit for education.

My only wish is that with the online training they include some sort of video-based classroom instruction.

Over all, keep up the fantastic work UIU!"
Junior,4,"I am in the online BSN program.  I have enjoyed my professors and the classes I have taken.  The class sizes are small and there haven't been a lot of group projects, which I appreciate.  The cost is high, but typical for an online BSN program."
Sophomore,4,"Air conditioning in all the dorms and free laundry! Food is great and lots of variety.
Chance to actually get to know your professors, and more importantly a chance for them to know you. At UIU you are actually a person and not just another face in the crowd.
As far as food goes, no reason to go hungry. Many healthy choices available, but if you want to live on pizza and ice cream, have at it.
The main drawback for some is that it is located in a small, rural community. You pretty much have to drive to get anywhere. UIU provides weekly trips to Ealmart, etc. Really not bad once you get used to it."
Freshman,4,Upper Iowa University is a home away from home for four years. The class schedules are amazing. You can take online courses along with courses on the campus. You only have to take three classes at the most for eight weeks. There is two terms in a semester and it is not to fast of a pace what so ever. With this school being a small private university you know almost all the students here and even most of the staff. A lot of the teachers give you their personal numbers and are always make time to help you if you need it. The small town feel is a little difficult to get used to coming from a big city but you get used to it after a little bit.
Niche User,4,"I went to take a visit in the fall at Upper Iowa University and it was great! I love the small town Iowa feel, the 3 classes for 8 weeks thing to focus, and the food was amazing."
Freshman,4,I like how it has small class sizes and it allows you to get to know the professors and can get extra help from them. The campus is small which is kinda nice. The staff and professors seem kind and helpful. It’s a beautiful campus. The only thing is a sidewalk to the new building.
Junior,4,"I go to the online/center campus in Bettendorf, Iowa. This campus is just one building and the student teacher ratio is great. The student to teacher ratio depends on the class you are enrolled in. Sometimes it can be very small like 8:1 and other times it can be up to 23:1. The professors are very kind and willing to help you succeed in any way. The professors work with you and are very flexible. Overall, the campus is great and the professors are very knowledgable and helpful."
Junior,4,Classes are small at the satelite campuses which makes for an easier learning experience. A lot of the courses are offered online which allows for a full time job while attending. It is a little pricey but cheaper than other 4year colleges in the area.
Junior,4,Professor and other staff members are very helpful and friendly. I have done most of schooling online but have been to campus for one class and I really enjoyed it.
Junior,4,What I like about Upper Iowa University is that it has smaller classes.  The Professors are very knowledgable and want to make sure you know what it is your learning. They are always willing to help.  The only thing I would change about the University is more financial help for people without children.  Other than that I enjoy being a student at the University.
Junior,4,"I like the 8 week terms I have at the distance education center, as well as online.  The classes are pretty pricey but that is expected for a private college.  There are many classes offered.  So far I have enjoyed the business courses and the teachers.  The teachers really know what they are teaching and all of them work in the field they are teaching about which is really nice!"
Junior,4,"I love going to this school, but get frustrated at a few internal things occasionally. I have to first say that I'm an online student, which is the source of the most frustrations. There is a definite rift in the difference between traditional and online students. The easiest examples of this is that traditional students have 16 week semester long courses, pretty much the normal. Online students however have 8 week long condensed courses with no choice to take 16 week options. Both have their advantages but some consistency there would be nice. Another inconsistency is that traditional students have a spring break and online students do not receive one, they just transfer from term 3 to term 4 overnight with no break. Those minor things aside the classes are great and teachers understand the difficulties associated with online courses."
Junior,4,I have loved upper Iowa University Quad Cities Campus. I loved doing the night classes two nights a week for 8 week sessions.
Freshman,4,The only thing I would like to change is the food and lack of transportation. Upper Iowa University is basically in the middle of nowhere you need a car to be able to do basically everything and the signal is really horrible there are actually 2 phone companies that actually works here in Iowa. 
Junior,4,I have currently enrolled in this University. I love how the employees are so prompt in responding to your questions and needs as well as being willing to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. 
College Freshman,4,"There are so many opportunities to meet people to network with, and there are many options so you are successful."
College Freshman,4,"College life at Upper Iowa is great. The people are all so nice, and everyone is a huge family. Alumni come all the time and talk, and there is people in every place possible that want nothing then for you to succeed. They will do anything to help with your goals, and if you're struggling."
College Freshman,4,"Well I have been in this school for a month and the first thing I heard upon my arrival was Greek life. I am really sorry I will not be able to tell you much about it because I'm still learning about it. Tge Greek life often organize functions to help make the community a better place. They also organize parties and fun stuffs to make everyone feel at ease after a long week. I started learning some words in Greek and it's really interesting. The Greek life also makes everyone feel welcome, they work together always and look forward to make new friends. They also like to learn about different cultures and how it relates to different societies in which people are brought up."
College Freshman,4,"The athletes are mostly seen together. They walk together, eat together, they really do team work. When there is a sports activity everyone attends. I was surprised the first time I noticed that because no one was forced to go. Everyone willingly went and it was so much fun with strong support and cheers. The facilities are the best. The coaches automatically become part of the lives of the athletes. Everyone loves sports in my school"
College Freshman,4,"The students are very friendly and everyone smiles as if they already know you. It is not difficult to pick up a conversation with someone you have never seen before here. The population is good in the sense that everyone knows each other. The professors and advisors are encouraging and always make the students smile. Even though there are mostly assignments loaded on us, the professors still send emails to the student on how far they are getting with the assignment. Encourage students to come to their offices each time they find something uneasy while doing the assignment. They simply make you feel at home with their love and care. Everyone here is simply amazing."
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe walking alone on campus, however, at night, I would prefer someone walking with me. I'm scared of the dark the way it is, but it's still erie."
College Freshman,4,"The sports don't always win, but the games are intense. The student section is one of the best I've seen. Lots of community people come to the sporting events!"
College Sophomore,4,sports are extremely important to the staff and students
College Sophomore,4,Very friendly and helpful in the admission process.
College Junior,4,I found that no matter the situation security was around to assist.
College Junior,4,I found the school takes pride in what society thinks of the way they appear.
College Junior,4,I found that staff made returning to school easier than I thought it would be.
College Junior,4,I have had a great experience so far. I work full-time at a school and after work I attend school myself to further my education. The instructors are very flexible and understanding. The class sizes are not too big so you get to know everyone.
College Junior,4,Your campus advisor helps out a lot when it comes finding internships and jobs after receiving your degree.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is helpful on campus from the career center to the president himself .The success of students are the most important and everyone works towards achieving that goal.
College Sophomore,4,Teaching and learning is great
College Junior,4,"Very nice school, professors are helpful and care about your success"
College Freshman,4,"My school year so year has been amazing! I've been getting involved in a lot of activities, getting to know a lot of people  and don't get me started with Greek Week  !"
College Junior,4,I am an online student in another state so I don't know.
College Junior,4,I am not on campus so I don't know.
College Junior,4,I can really see myself getting my degree and finding a job in my field shortly after.
College Junior,4,I am an online student but I love the online environment. It's accommodating and easy to use!
College Junior,4,I actually have no idea because I am an online student and have never been to the UIU campus
College Sophomore,4,The Athletic teams participate and compete at a high standard. Football and Basketball are especially popular. The facilities could be improved but are still adequate. Intramural sports are also popular and competitive.
College Sophomore,4,"This School has a small but beautiful campus, and there is a great connection between students, faculty and the community. I have enjoyed the majority of my classes, as they are all useful and interesting. The sports facilities could be improved, but there are still lots of great facilities currently. There are lots of ways to get involved including Greek life, intramurals and other clubs. This school is unique because the classes are small which provides a more 1 on 1 teaching basis, and the 8 week terms are great as you can focus on specific courses for a shorter amount of time."
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are small teachers know you and can work one on one with you when you need help with homework or getting ready for a test
College Freshman,4,Apartment style living is the best
College Freshman,4,The baseball and softball fields could be rebuilt
Recent Alumnus,4,"I haven't tried to get a job yet, but I'm sure a degree from this school will hold up fine, I think it is more to do with the field and the person holding it and not th school it came from."
Recent Alumnus,4,Professors usually take an interest in their students. Courses are taught in a compact format to speed you through. I like it a lot. Glad I came here. I'm just a very boring bookish student to get a super awesome response here.
Recent Alumnus,4,I am happy I chose UIU as I love the small school atmosphere and it is quality education.
Recent Alumnus,4,I didn't go for the sports?
College Junior,4,Online classes are easy to access anytime.  The professors have set times to call them or we can email them anytime and they get back to us in a timely matter.
College Junior,4,"So far my experience with Upper Iowa has been great.  Taken classes online at first was something to get use to, but now it is easy.  The professors engage the students to think outside the box."
College Junior,4,The athletic facilities have been updated and you become very close to the coaches while doing sports at Upper Iowa as well the other athletes from other sports!
Freshman,2,First year student and I feel this is a good school for local kids. I was raised in Las Vegas so city kids probably do not like this school that much.
Sophomore,2,"The only reason I'm going here is because they only have my major and the campus is beautiful. Other than that, the school is kinda sketchy when it comes to dealing with financial aid. They are rude when students come in and request reasons for certain charges."
College Freshman,2,Drugs are obviously present. Nothing is done about it right away.
College Junior,2,Do we have Greek Life?
College Freshman,2,The athletic at my school aren't really that amazing... there decent!
College Senior,2,"There are no health services on campus. There is one counselor who just started in 2015 who is pretty good, but she's the only person on campus that has over 1,000 people on it."
College Senior,2,"Unless you're a business major, english major, or an education major, you will have bad luck with professors. Most of the more driven professors left the university two years ago because the school wanted to cut their salary and take away some of their benefits. The CIS major has hardly any classes that cover the basic requirements and skills many businesses are looking for their employees to know (such as the .NET architecture)."
College Senior,2,I am on a military installation. Therefore there are no sports involved in this campus.
College Senior,2,The school I attend does not have a lunch room available for us.  The only thing we have are a few vending machines in the break room.  Their is a microwave their so if u want real food you have to bring your own food or go out to eat since the options are slim
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is not that important at Upper Iowa, mostly because most of the student pop. is athletes."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much of a transportation service since the campus is really small.
College Senior,2,Don't have an on campus nurse on call nurse for students.
College Senior,2,"Expensive meal plans, of campus student dont get meals."
College Senior,2,"Very Expensive, doesn't matter if you are in the new dorms or the old ones still pricey."
College Junior,2,In Fayette there is no public transportation; either you will have to walk to the store or have a car to leave town to go to larger stores.
College Sophomore,2,The school does not have many things to do on-campus to keep people from going to house parties and getting drunk.
College Sophomore,2,"Snow and cold weather makes for a horrible experience 3 months out of the year and if you drive to school, your car will have to deal with all sorts of horrible weather."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking lots are not taken care of during the winter. Facilities only halfway plows the Garbee and South Village parking lots, and the parking lot by Dorman is not too much better! The only place that is well taken care of is the Student Center, which is only for visitors and Aramark workers."
College Sophomore,2,It would be better if UIU had the funds to hire more security guards.
College Sophomore,2,"I do not know what is wrong with the financial aid this year, because last year I receive many scholarships and everything went smoothly."
Freshman,1,"This is my first semester here and I hate everything about it, if you're a city kid run. If you don't have a car in good condition run.  There's nothing to do. It's a ghost town."
Graduate Student,1,I enrolled in the Master's program after a great sales pitch from the advisor Milwaukee WI campus. I took a class in place of a foundations Math class than my program emphasis changed without my knowledge. When I switched to a different emphasis program I was told I had to take a Math class that I had been told I did  not have to take when I enrolled.  If your not paying attention classes will be added to your program without your knowledge. The school is a scam.
Niche User,1,school sucks!!!!!!!! if you try to transfer to play a sport elsewhere they will make it very hard and the athletic director is a idiot!! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN FROM THIS SCHOOL. what a bunch of nut jobs!!!!!!!!!! Everything is very unorganized
College Senior,1,"The alumni will sometimes donate money, but the last major donation was to establish a new squad of cheer-leaders rather than to rebuild the math building that's been falling apart for years. There is no career center, there's just one person in charge of ""student success"" which is a very broad topic."
College Senior,1,"Bar food, and no student discounts"

College Freshman,1,"Uiu is located in Fayette,IA which is a very small town in the middle of a cornfield. The only way to get out of town to do some shopping is on Sundays trhough the Office of Student Developement which only the first 14 students to sign up get to go. I suggest having a car!"

Junior,5,"As someone who is online at Granite State College, I find the experience to be very rewarding. I went for online schooling before the pandemic, and it allows me to work a full-time job as well as have the freedom to do my school work at my own pace. The tuition is pretty standard, though, with the added sense of freedom and being able to do the work from home, I would say that I'm very satisfied overall."

Senior,5,"Because I travel a lot I take all of my classes online, and I will honestly say that it is a blessing. Online classes allow for complete flexibility and the professors are willing to work with you (so long as you alert them ahead of time). When my family and I was moving from Georgia to Montana, for instance, I told my professors about the situation and they gave me a deadline. One professor even went as far to say that I could turn in my assignments when we've settled in our new place. All-in-all, I would recommend online classes to anyone that doesn't have the ability to take classes on campus."
Alum,5,The professors make this school outstanding. The courses are well thought out and challenging. They are supportive and understanding yet they demand that you live up to expectations. I enjoyed my time at Granite State College  and may come back for my masters degree!!
Alum,5,Online courses were setup well. I enjoyed my classes and found myself navigating the site well after just a couple of days. The online classes are demanding at times but that is part of college in general. Professors are out standing and working online wasn’t that much different than it would’ve been going to a an actual class room. I highly recommend this school!
Freshman,5,"Granite State College is a modern based school in which they help struggling students in the best way for them. They offer 100% online classes to get the degree the students dreams of getting, while still living their normal everyday lives. The school understands that not everyone has time to be a full-time student. They are an affordable school, beating most schools around them, without having to attend multiple schools to save money to be able to get the degree the student wants. All in all, I highly recommend Granite State College as it is affordable and self-paced."
Sophomore,5,"I love the online learning setting. Granite State College does a great job with feedback, enrollment and signing up for classes."

Freshman,5,"I've been given an amazing opportunity tuition wise with granite state. I attended White Mountains Community College in NH for my associates in nursing, Granite state is allowing me to pay the same tuition as I did at WMCC. I will be working as a full time Registered Nurse, working full time will make it hard to go to school at the same time. I will be in a RN to BSN online program which is an amazing, I will be able to work and go to school as a full time nursing student as well. In just a short 18 months I will have my bachelors in Nursing."
Junior,5,"I am an older student and had reservations about returning to college and taking online courses. As i am progressing with my degree i have found the administration and professors are outstanding. Everyone wants you to succeed and perform to the best of your abilities. There has not been a time that i have reached out to my adviser or any professor to seek support or answer questions with excellent support and guidance.
Granite State college has been outstanding and supportive at all levels. I was enrolled in a University in a different area years ago and contacted them when i wanted to return to college. They were less than helpful and on numerous occasions ignored my requests to discuss my options."
Junior,5,"I love how the classes are organized, even the online classes.  They seem to be structured to help students get the most out of their learning experience."
Junior,5,"It is ideal for adult students that have full-time jobs and families. I can manage my course work from my computer in any setting that I need to, sports field, car, and work on lunch. If I didn't have an online undergraduate program I would not have been able to return to college and complete my degree."
Senior,5,Excellent college and the advisors are amazing! They helped me fond a major that was perfect for me and it was one that I never knew was available. The classes that are offered are exactly what I was looking for. I am completing everything online and it is the perfect way to complete my bachelor's degree and I am still able to work full time.

Senior,4,"There's not enough great things to say about Granite State College. From day one of my transfer, the staff have been extremely helpful. One of the great things about this college is that I can complete my degree completely online; this is very helpful, especially since I'm having to care for a family member with special needs. The classes have great professors that make the classes interesting and provide intellectually engaging content. I've been at this college for a while now and I actually intent to get my graduate degree with this college once my bachelor's is complete."

Freshman,4,This is my first year attending Granite so I am only speaking as a freshman but I am happy with the University so far.

Sophomore,4,"Granite State College is the perfect college for those who are seeking to work while pursuing a degree.  Being able to take my classes online enables me to study and learn at a time that matches my schedule. Not every student prospers in a campus environment and not every student is able to go to college without having to work to pay for it, so Granite State College is an option for students like me."
Sophomore,4,"Granite State is a good school overall. There are a diverse offering of classes, but they appear to be one a very specific schedule (can only take some during specific semesters even though they are regular classes and not targeted classes). I can't speak to the campus, athletics, or other aspects as I am an online student. The professors I have had so far are all incredibly friendly and well receptive to feedback and communications."

College Junior,2,"Summers are hot, and winters are frigid and snowy. Just typical New England, in other words! There are often cancellations in the winter."
College Senior,2,"Required, unpaid internship for Education majors."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I felt most of the teachers here just taught for some extra cash. They hardly checked into their online classes, grades were automatic or arbitrary (usually inflated). They hardly posted in class discussions or offered feedback. There were a few teachers who really did put in a great but for the most part professors were noticeably absent.  "
Alum,1,I graduated in 2011 and have no job have not used my Degree to get any jobs i had. It is not recognized as much as university Degrees are. Also my friends who graduated same year dont have jobs in the business management ir related field. My advise go to snhu
College Junior,1,"I'm not sure GSC even has a nightlife! There are various campuses (Nashua, Concord, Manch, etc.) so it really depends on where you are."
College Student,1,"Few but Good – B.S in Psych offered by a regionally accredited online? Great.
That being the only B.S offered 100% online? Not so great.

I'll most likely transfer because of this."
Recent Alumnus,1,"THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MAJORS TO CHOOSE FROM. NOW THAT THEY ARE STARTING THEIR MASTERS, THEY JUST HAVE NO TOOLS, NOT ENOUGH INSTRUCTORS. THOSE THAT TEACH HAVE ONLY 1 YEAR MORE EDUCATION THAN THE STUDENTS."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Enough Space – The college is promoting their business to invite more students but they are not prepared, and parking is one of the things they are not considering for more students."

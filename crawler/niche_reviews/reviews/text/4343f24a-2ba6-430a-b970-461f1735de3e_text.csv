Alum,5,"Indiana University is an amazing campus for all. It is a welcoming environment for all which is extremely important when it comes to a university. You will always hear about the beauty of our campus. From the nice sunset seen at Sample gates to our academics and programs, Indiana University is the place to be. With the school being so big, yet it felt like a small community. There are many clubs and organizations to get involved with that will make you feel at home. There is something about being on campus that everyone loves, and will miss as soon as you are far and away. Indiana University was great to me and I can only say positive things about my alma mater. To the squirrels that run up to you as you are walking to class to the late nights at Wells library, Indiana University will always have a special place in my heart."
Freshman,5,The professors are patient with questions and have adapted with us to being online. It's just a great environment and you get a sense of that being an online student as well as actually being on campus.
Junior,5,IU is a great school with amazing people! At IU you make tons of friends and typically have very friendly professors who are there to help!
Niche User,5,I am currently taking classes online through my high school and in person. I enjoy taking the classes and they are easy to understand.
Niche User,5,"Indiana University is a school that provides it all for its students.  I feel safe and very in the know with everything that is going on, even with taking classes online through my high school."
Sophomore,5,"IU is an amazing college. The academics are stimulating, and there's plenty of opportunities to do research and explore your interests. What's more, is that the professors genuinely care about your success and wellbeing. I always know that I can count on my professors to be understanding and help me learn."
Sophomore,5,"My experience here at Indiana University has fantastic so far. I met so many great people and grew as a person. The campus is gorgeous and well kept. There's only one thing that I would to see change, and that's diversity. I believe this University can go to knew heights if it was more diverse."
Graduate Student,5,"Beautiful campus, excellent faculty. Plenty of ways for students to get involved. Great reputation. #1 online MBA program."
Graduate Student,5,Have had the opportunity to take advantage of several online programs with IU. Easy experience. Flexibility for my schedule and family situation.
Niche User,5,"I did not take any classes online, I took most in person. Indiana Uninversity has always been a school that I had wanted to go to. I am very excited to share my expirence with everyone."

Freshman,5,The professors are doing the best they can to engage students in online learning! I can easily access the assignments that I have and they are very clear on the due dates of the assignments!
Freshman,5,"No complaints! Everyone has been very helpful in setting me up for success. Being a Freshman, I was a little intimidated by the vastness of the school. I do not feel that way any longer. I feel like a part of the IU family."
Freshman,5,"Due to COVID I am taking 1/2 of my classes online and everything is going very well. Technology is key, and any help that I need has been made availale."
Graduate Student,5,Indiana and my professors make it easy to keep track of my learning through the Canvas portal. Professors know how to effectively present materials and deadlines.
Niche User,5,"I have never had the opportunity to have online learning with Indiana University, but I do appreciate the online offers for campus guidance and tours for incoming freshmen in the fall."
Niche User,5,I like that they reach out to me every so often through email and physical mail to remind me of the upcoming opportunities and scholarship applications that I am eligible for. As a high school senior it can be very stressful trying to remember every due date for applications.
Alum,5,Online course were easy to navigate and easy to use.  The classes were very up to date and provided relevant information
Alum,5,Excellent program very engaging fast paced and you were able to apply real life experience to what you were learning
Freshman,5,I have enjoyed my time at Indiana University even though I have not been able to truly experience campus yet due to COVID-19. They have done a great job handling online classes during the pandemic.
Freshman,5,Online learning at Indiana University has been easy to navigate. I have been able to learn with the materials they have used such as canvas and one.iu.
Freshman,5,I am coming in as a freshmen but I have family that has graduated and I have heard great things about the professors and the overall atmosphere of the campus.
Freshman,5,I have yet to attend IUB. I will start fall 2020 as an incoming freshman. So far I am very impressed with IU and can’t wait to be a part of the community. This is the perfect school for me.

Freshman,5,Indiana University is an amazing school and has amazing opportunities and resources for every student.
Freshman,5,Many professors have been using the Zoom application in order to reach out to the class as a whole or even individuals. There have also been plenty of uses in canvas and emails.
Junior,5,"Indiana University is a big campus with about 50,000 kids; however, there are numerous clubs and organizations that you can join in order to find a tight-knit community and make IU your home. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Luddy Engineering School and the staff. They are very accommodating for students with disabilities, such as ADHD."
Junior,5,"I have been taking classes online for the past semester, and I believe Indiana University is handling the CVID-19 situation very well. I think the use of IU Box folders and Zoom is a good combination for students to keep learning from the safety of their own homes."
Junior,5,"My experience at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana has been a great one. I have made a ton of friends and made a lot of connections. IU Bloomington does a great job at making everyone feel included. The school is also very diverse. IU has amazing greek life as well as fun sporting events."
Junior,5,"Due to COVID, I had to take classes online and my online class experience at Indiana University was solid. Professors were very understanding, the work load was about the same, if not a little less than usual and the professors truly cared about giving all their students the greatest and most interactive teaching experience as they could since they taught classes on zoom."
Sophomore,5,"The teaching environment in the original buildings makes you feel like your knowledge is being raised. The sense of vintage architecture beneath the limestone and brick buildings depicts a message of self-absorbing modernization, regarding the ways these structures reveal their glory of standing in the shadows of a community that has felt the footsteps from the legends that have walked it for two centuries. There was never a sense of feeling defeat, knowing that the swaying bark of the oak canopies gave a glimmer of hope as each day came about. There is a sense of feeling important amongst these individuals who scatter around these paths, all eager to grasp their trophy of their future."
Senior,5,"Great campus and sporting events, the town is nice and very active. There is always something to do and Bloomington is a great place. The academics are also very good, especially the business school."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Indiana University this upcoming year, so from what I have heard and seen from campus visits, I love the environment, academics, and athletics!"
Sophomore,5,Classes online were interesting. They worked well though for the remainder of the semester and I didn't stop learning when we switched.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love IU! I could not see myself at any other university! We have everything that you could possibly ask for- 200+ majors, amazing food, a beautiful campus, and much more!"
Junior,5,"Due to the events of COVID-19 classes were online in the last two months of the past semester. Given the situation and lack of time, my online experience was as good as it could have been."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely loved it. It was so easy to get involved and find things that I am genuinely interested in. The student body as a whole is so kind and welcoming.
Sophomore,5,The institution and professors were constantly in contact with the students to make sure that they knew what was going on. The professors worked hard to quickly change their classes and lesson plans to make them online friendly.
Freshman,5,"Even in the light of what's going on in the world, the school was better than I expected even though i didn't get to experience a full semester there. The campus itself was very nice. The dorms were exceptional, the food was great and the atmosphere was great as well. The teaching environment is great even though i didn't get to go through with a full term."
Sophomore,5,"I had a great experience while living on campus. Even though classes got moved online, we were able to easily access class work through canvas and other school issued resources."
Alum,5,"The greatest part about IU is the campus life, it's a huge campus and you'll meet an array of people with diverse interests during the span of 4 years. Hoosiers for life!"
Alum,5,"While at IU, I took a few online courses for the Kelley School of Business at 1.5 credits and the curriculum worked around Canvas as a primary software which worked well with our 30 or so classroom setting."
Freshman,5,"Although I'm an incoming freshman, people from the Admissions office and Advisors within my major's school have been a great resource to navigate the transition between high school and college in an unprecedented time like this!"
Freshman,5,"From what I've seen, the professors extend their knowledge and care over Zoom and through Canvas similar to how they would in a traditional classroom."
Sophomore,5,"Indiana University is home. Great faculty, great students... Numerous services that make the college experience as best as it can be."
Freshman,5,"Indiana University was my home away from home. For me, freshman year was a big transition and over the course of two semesters taught me an insane amount about life. When I opened my eyes to all of the possibilities out there I found my dream major, my best friends, and fell in love with the school. All of the professors are focused on the success of their students and the campus as a whole is breathtaking. Overall, spending my freshman year at Indiana University  was a blessing and I genuinely wish I could experience it all over again for the first time. I absolutely loved it."
Sophomore,5,IU is such a beautiful campus all year long. There are so many places to explore all around campus that could easily become a great area to study at.
Freshman,5,"Lets me start off by saying that Indiana University-Bloomington is a place where dreams come true. Now, when I say this I am not talking about Disneyland. I am talking about a school that treats everyone like family. Every person who attends this school, whether it be a janitor, student, faculty, or even a visitor everyone is treated with respect, comfort, and love. Everyone has a support system so one can shine and find their true identity. From the first steps to the last, every single person learns and can teach something from their experience at Indiana University-Bloomington"
Sophomore,5,"Overall, My freshman year at IU has been great. Since the coronovirus has caused the campus to be closed my classes have been moved online. This was a very hard transition and I do not think my education was as good as it should have been."
Freshman,5,"I have never felt more at home while being away from home. IU may seem like a huge and intimidating school, but it eventually turns into a small world. I have met some of the best people and professors while at my time here. There are so many opportunities and experiences to be involved in. Going to Indiana University has truly been the best decision of my life."
Alum,5,"IU-Bloomington continues to astonish me with its beauty and on-going growth. With every return to campus, there is a new building to marvel at or upgrades being done to support the size of the student population in the original buildings. There are majors in just about every field of study and for those that are not currently in existence, students have the opportunity to create their own unique pathway to a degree. Take a look around the campus for natural wonders or venture to the multiple state parks in the area."
Freshman,5,"I took an online course at Indiana University, it was very seamless. The tests were challenging and I pushed myself in the course."
Alum,5,"IU offered the best college life--education, culture, growing up. After school, I think that my education at IU has offered me a lot of opportunities to build and grow."
Niche User,5,"I love everything about it-the campus is great and there are so many great opportunities! While applying, there were so many great different majors and ways you could go in order to reach your intended career path! Along with the various amount of majors to choose from, there are so many extra clubs and activities to be involved in as well."
Senior,5,The best four years of my life. Teachers are all very inclined to help you grow as a student and the career offices will help you find success after college.
Alum,5,"My college experience was the highlight of my life at this point. Between the culture, the available opportunities (both academically and socially), and the academics, I was able to prepare for the real world."
Niche User,5,"When I first got there, I thought to myself, it was going to be bad and not fun. But, when I got there it was fun and I get to meet people who were attending College/University there and the people were nice and with my cousins we went to our cousin dorms/apartment, and it smell not good and I noticed that there was no bathroom and I wonder to myself, if they need to poop or pee at night or take shower, where did they go, because, there is no bathroom in his and his mate room. I guess the bathroom is faraway. Anyway, I get to meet many good people and kind people and they have nice restaurant and the restaurant are from different country like, there was a Korean restaurant, Thai, Burmese and others. They also have like gas station store but, it not a gas station though. And they are international students and they have beautiful flowers and building. Overall, it was a great experience and I hope to visit again soon in the future."
Sophomore,5,"Through these tough times it has begun to be very difficult to find happiness not being surrounded by hundreds of colleagues and friends each day.  As an extrovert, I obtain my energy through the interaction of other people and this has been difficult given the circumstances.  Luckily, I do have a big family to go home to which include my mom, dad, older brother, younger brother, younger sister, and my dad’s mother also.  I have been cooped up in a house too small for us for about a month now and I am going to tell you how I have found my joy in such a tragic time during what is supposed to be one of the best college years of our lives."
Freshman,5,"The beauty of campus was my first introduction to the school, whether it was the trees surrounding or the creeks flowing throughout, the campus was one of true serenity. The student life there is perfect, as the athletics and the education make for a once in a life time opportunity."
Sophomore,5,I would highly recommend anyone to attend Indiana university because it is a very welcoming place and the classes push you to be your best. I have made many friends that I hope to stay in touch with for the rest of my life and have made many memories that I will forever remember. The food courts are some of the best food you will ever eat and the dorm rooms are also very good and enough room and not small at all. The campus is quite spread out so class may be far away so you will get in a little workout while walking to class
Freshman,4,All of my classes were online. Going in to it I was a little bit disappointed because you wouldn't be able to meet anyone but after a while the transition to all online school was easy.
Freshman,4,Indiana University is a good school with great sports and academics. There is also plenty to do on campus and around campus as well.
Sophomore,4,"Indiana University is my new home. Everything here just brings happiness. The campus is so pretty. All of my professors that I've had actually know how to teach and care. There's also a Starbucks in like every building, which is a plus for me. It's not that diverse though, but it promotes diversity."
Alum,4,I didn't take many online classes during my college career but after COVID-19 we were forced to all go online which was not a bad experience for me. The professors are very understanding and made sure we had all the resources we needed to succeed in class. Online classes can be difficult but with the help of our great professors we were able to get through these challenging times.
Freshman,4,I'm a completely online student and it's been great because I get all my assignments at the beginning of the week so I can plan ahead and manage my time.
Junior,4,"Although it hasn't been ideal to have to go online, IU has done their best for students and professors to make online learning go as smoothly as possible."
Sophomore,4,I love IU's campus and atmosphere.  The environment is beautiful and the classes are interesting and varied.  I wish it was closer to a city for an enhanced college experience.
Sophomore,4,The professors and the university itself have done their best to make the most of a difficult situation. The classes are just as engaging as they were before. My only complaint is that asynchronous classes are difficult and do not provide the full experience.
Freshman,4,"IU has created a good online learning experience.  The professors are still getting the hang of how it all works, but overall I feel it is going well.  The other down fall though is sometimes I feel I am not learning the material as well as I would if classes were in person.  I do understand the circumstances we are under but I do believe there could be a way to engage students better and maybe since most students have all online classes or mostly online classes, the tuition prices could be lowered.  Though these  are downfalls of IU online learning, I do believe these are present in other educational institutions as well and resolutions can be found at some point.  If IU continues to pursue in giving a good quality education, then these downfalls may not be such a concern.  Also, these concerns can be solved or begin to be solved if the school takes students concerns, comments, and questions into account/consideration."
Freshman,4,I've just recently started but IU is a great school! I'm from Bloomington so IU has been my dream school and it is living up to my expectations! They have also handled the COVID-19 pandemic very well.
Graduate Student,4,"Indiana University and the Kelley School of Business has been a great school to pursue my MBA. My program offers all online classes with a few on-campus weeks to help you feel more connected to the university and your classmates. My professors are responsive to any questions and really understand the core material that you need to learn. Program administrators are also very willing to work with you when it comes to finances, and course registration."
Sophomore,4,"IU Bloomington is a great school because it offers many opportunities and has different programs suited for everyone. It also has a beautiful campus with a lot of nature. The only thing I wish it had was more diversity, for example more minority groups."
Sophomore,4,Learning online is a little harder because I am a hands on and visual learner. All my classes are online except for my lab for nursing.
Senior,4,"I'd say the best thing about Indiana University (and Bloomington) is the diversity of opportunity. No matter what your interests are, you can find a group to support you. From martial arts to music to foreign language and culture, there is a lot going on. 

I believe the biggest issue with IU is that it overcharges students for everything. And it spends money on useless things like statues."
Freshman,4,So far it has been one day and the entire canvas center has crashed.So far it has been one day and the entire canvas center has crashed.
Freshman,4,"Overall a very lovely campus, lots to do. Downsides being campus is big which means a lot of walking and very pricy tuition."
Alum,4,"I loved the students and the professors, as well as the campus facilities.  I would like to see the university accept more students from Indiana."
Sophomore,4,Overall the school is great but there are some pitfalls. There are professors who don’t care about there students but then professors that help in every way possible. I will say that the computer science is male dominated and sexist to women. The people otherwise are great and you really get the college experience.
Freshman,4,There is always a place to go if you ever need help and the students are all super friendly and are always there to help.
Sophomore,4,"My professors have been extremely understanding and during this period of online learning. We are all working to get through this together. IU has given their students access to even more opportunities to earn credits during this time as well. My only complaint is that tuition raised despite students not receiving the same type of education as the year before. However, other than that all is well."

Junior,4,Being online during covid-19 has been hard for everyone but the lectures and meetings have gone well.
Junior,4,Indiana University offers great resources and facilities for its students. There could be more of an effort made when it comes to diversity.
Freshman,4,I have not taken any classes online yet at Indiana University. This upcoming year I will be taking online classes here for the first time!
Sophomore,4,"They suck at telling you everything you need to know. There is so much information you need to know. BUT, it is a very good school with fantastic teachers who are there to advise you and point you in the right direction. Overall a fantastic school just carry around a pen and pencil."
Sophomore,4,The education is well.However some professors over due their part and act like they are so much better then us. Also there are few racist issues
Junior,4,"IU is a great school that needs to listen to their students. After mold outbreaks, professors spouting racist and misogynistic ideas, classes intentionally made tougher by the COVID-10 pandemic, closings of dorms, trying to evict students from their dorm rooms, etc. they still haven't learned that in order for them to be a good school they have to actually take care of their students and quit only looking at their bank statements! Otherwise: great school! Lots of great opportunities and an generally good education. Math classes are required and should be taken as simply as possible because the math department is terrible and cannot teach or grade anything in any way that makes sense to someone without a PhD in Mathematics. Great arts scene on campus and in the surrounding community."
Freshman,4,It was a big change switching from classroom to online learning against our will. It was difficult but I was able to get my work done even if it was through a screen.
Sophomore,4,"I had to take online classes during the spring 2020 semester. We used canvas and Tophat to submit class work, and I was able to keep up with my classes."
Junior,4,IU has a beautiful campus with very knowledgeable professors. Academics are great but it is expensive to attend. I've had a great experience so far but it can be frustrating when so many students are in debt and the school decides to build a new clock tower rather than using that money to improve other areas.
Freshman,4,"Indiana University has a wonderful academic program for my major in psychology. Their academic advisors are great at working with students to both push their potential and protect them from overload. The campus is especially beautiful in the fall and spring, but winter can be brutal as it is a large campus that in my case required long walks from class to class."
Sophomore,4,"IU utilizes its resources to give students a great education. Due to the situation, learning has been difficult for all of us. Professors have been equally considerate of the situation. How we decide to utilize the resources provided is up to us."
Freshman,4,"Good school for business, music and sciences. Helpful and caring faculty. Large and involved student body. Food could be improved or changed."
Alum,4,The university has great classes and a large number of subjects to study. The psychology program and gender studies program in particular were very valuable to me and offered interested discussion.
Junior,4,"I love attending IU. There is a student culture here that is enthralling and amazing to be a part of. The party atmosphere is what I was looking for, but the academics are also equally as amazing. I'm glad I chose to attend IU."
Sophomore,4,"A beautiful, but mixed bag. A great place to craft your future with caring professionals. If you attend here and don't feel supported, you might just be in the wrong program. I transferred within the university and feel it is an excellent fit that helped me meet great educators and amazing friends."
Sophomore,4,"Indiana University has a fair share of most of the things people look for in a college. It’s a beautiful campus and they hold themselves to high standards, especially with academics."
Freshman,4,IU Bloomington is a great school. The campus is beautiful and there is always something to do. The people are there are great. The classes help you grow.
Niche User,4,"I like all of IU Bloomington's resources they give to help you succeed, however, I would like to see their communications with students regarding the safety of the campus to improve."
Alum,4,"Indiana University has a lot to offer. You just have to go out, explore, and seek it. Every niche is available, so play to your strengths! If you want a learning community, you can live in a dorm that specializes in that. If you want to be away from campus, there are plenty of apartments. If you don't like the party scene, don't live in the Northwest neighborhood of campus, etc...It can be easy to feel alone on such a large campus, so finding a club, group, or people within your degree to connect with is critical, but IU has opportunity for that in abundance. As for academics, you get what you put in, as I would imagine for most universities. For my degree, I had plenty of opportunities for office hours, student tutoring at the library, and more."
Niche User,4,"After visiting IU Bloomington, the campus was spacious and held numerous infrastructures  that included many attractions in them, such as historical paintings and drawings. It also included nearby restaurants that cooked amazing meals. The diversity was pretty high, since I witnessed numerous Asians and other races around campus. Although, there have been many incidents stated on the news that students were injured due to the bus drivers. What I would like to change is to increase the safety for students in and outside the campus and provide more attractions outside of it. While the college campus is beautiful and spacious, the town is small in comparison and lacks the same atmosphere from its college nearby."
Freshman,4,I love B-Town.  The campus is awesome and there are lots of things to do on Kirkwood.  Every week I get together with a group of friends and we walk down Kirkwood and try a new restaurant. Bloomington is full of ethnic restaurants to explore.  On campus there is tons of space to get together with friends and play pick up football games or frisbee.  Everyone is very nice and outgoing and its easy to find and fit in with various groups and meet new people.
Freshman,4,"I love the campus and the architecture. The campus has a fascinating history, that I think everyone could find something of interest to them. I would like to see more accessible scholarships."
Freshman,4,What I do like about Indiana University is how well their education system is set up. Indiana University is a researched based school and the education provided to us is well. I would change the diversity of the school. The school is majority white. This can be seen as a problem because many individuals may not feel included or that they belong at the school. Maybe more efforts to make the school more diverse is what I would change about Indiana University
Freshman,4,I love being able to pursue my psychology degree in an institution with such a successful and renowned program. The professors are helpful and care about their students
Freshman,4,"It’s expensive and the classes are very large, I like my dorm and the food is ok. The campus is great but very large."
Freshman,4,"Bloomington is such an amazing place to be living in and attending school. The scenery alone is great, the people are very nice, and everyone seems to be very welcoming. I'm a freshman, so many of my classes are 100 level, intro, so I think this might have affected it but I had a few professors who were not the best, however I also had other professors who were amazing. Any class I took for the Kelley School of Business turned out great and it is understandable why they are a top business school."
Freshman,4,"After just finishing my furst semester, I tend to think that college life is not exactly the greatest. I am always too busy to hang out with friends or have any kind of a social life. I think that college is worth the investment because of the edge it will give you after graduation. You just need to hold on tight until you are done."
Freshman,4,"I love the diversity at IU. There is a vast amount of options for students who may need help with any kind of issue such as student services, financial aid, study groups, writing center."
Freshman,4,I have found it pleasant during the application process of receiving information about my admission and acceptance to the university.
Junior,4,I love that it's a college town but there are still things to do that aren't school related. I've made life long friends here and I've had opportunity to study with some amazing professors.
Junior,4,"I love the campus, and the vast number of classes and resources offered. I wish the school spent more money on things that matter though (eg. moldy dorms) rather than on a shiny bell tower."
Freshman,4,"I was initially overwhelmed and anxious to come here because of the huge number of students that attend this university. However, as I began meeting people and attending classes, I began to like it more than I expected. The people are generally very friendly and welcoming especially if you're a first-year student. There are loads to do here from and there will be definitely a group of people that you can most definitely relate to."
Alum,4,"IU is a very large college. A helpful tip is to know what major you want to go into before beginning school, as it is extremely expensive. Also, check out the 'ratemyprofessors' website beforehand to make sure you get a great professor."
Freshman,4,"Bloomington is a beautiful campus with many activities for students and ways to get involved. However, it is a VERY big campus (both in size and population) and can be very overwhelming."
Niche User,4,The campus was nice and the staff members are very helpful and kind. All the students I met were very kind.
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere of learning at IU Bloomington and the ability to feed my yearning for knowledge with amazing professors and assistant teaching instructors. I would love to see IU Bloomington focus more on fixing student housing and providing more financial services for students.
Freshman,4,"Indiana University has a beautiful campus with friendly students and faculty. I've only been going here for a couple of months, but I feel completely at home. It may be a large school but once you get acclimated it feels small, in a sense that everyone you know becomes your friends. The classes are not as large as you think, so you don't feel overwhelmed or distant from your professors. Overall, I have enjoyed my time here so far and can't wait for the next 3 years!"
Niche User,4,"I have always wanted to go to Indiana University because my whole family is an indiana fan. My grandpa went to this University when he was younger for dental.   So I have grown up in that kind of enviornment so I want to go to school for dental hygiene. I have heard that since the school is like 200 years old, they have found mold in some of the buildings. So thats not really good."
Niche User,4,I liked that all of the students on campus was very welcoming on my visit there. I got offer a ride around the campus and even an offer for lunch. I really thank you guys for the hospitality!!!
Junior,2,Instructors did the worst job. They literally do not teach so good luck learning and good luck registering for classes. There's not enough room for everyone.
Junior,2,"There are many things I dislike about the school with a few positives. Firstly, the main attractions to the school really aren't based on academics. You'll hear a lot of people say they want to go to the school because the campus is beautiful, they are a basketball fan, or they like to party. While I've been here,  the campus has been under constant construction, detracting from its beauty. One of the main roads on the campus is a one way and all of them are one lane. There are many people on campus which can lead to long trips time wise when they should be short. Many of the classes I want to take only have one or two meeting times, leading me to a waitlist position. The administration has poorly handled the coronavirus. I had already signed a lease with an apartment because they said there would be in person classes, yet after saying that, all of my classes are web based. Some of the Computer Science professors are very good. UI instructors are most of the time very helpful."
Sophomore,2,It’s very hard and professors assign loads of work like we don’t have 6/7 other classes to finish work in!
Freshman,2,"I did not enjoy taking classes online, felt robbed of the in classroom experience and it felt like I was teaching myself all of the course material"
Freshman,2,The classes are okay. The administration does not care about mental and physical illnesses. The housing situation is horrible. Only freshmen for next semester are currently allowed to stay on campus next year because IU has to shut down 3 dorms because they had mold in them so they are kicking everyone else off campus. They say that you can pick your roommate but that is a total lie. They are only in it for the money.
Alum,2,"You know there's a lot I did like about IU Bloomington but also a lot that I hated. The campus is beautiful and the social scene is good. There's a diverse crowd and plenty of programs in just about every field. However, the administration really doesn't care about you. What's more important to them is that you pay your tuition on time. They go on and on about this ""IU promise"" but don't even go into specifics for what they can actually promise students and it certainly isn't a decent job after graduation. Sad to say that for my senior year there wasn't any programs to prepare grads for the job search. They have career services and career fairs but it's not at all helpful if you are looking for a job in a specific field. Once you stop paying you get even less service. It means nothing to be an IU Alum. I regret choosing this school."
Alum,2,"You are just a number here - No one cares, and it's nearly impossible to get help from advisors, professors, anyone.  It's vastly overpriced considering the majority of your education is sitting in a lecture hall with 300 other kids for an hour twice a week.  I received my Bachelors here and I make more than $10,000 less than my husband who only has a H.S. Diploma.  The frat/sorority scene is very big there as well - that's not my scene personally.  The only frat party I attended, I was constantly groped and basically treated like a piece of meat (this is not even a joke but an exact quote: ""Hi, what's your name? Wanna go to my room and f***?"").  The campus is beautiful, though, and there are so many amazing forests and parks nearby to enjoy."
Freshman,2,"I have not enjoyed my first 3+ months at this school very much. The student life at Indiana is pretty pathetic. A lot of the students I have met only seem to want to party and are quick to make you feel guilty if you don't want to. Many don't seem approachable, and I haven't noticed much of a tight community. The party scene takes up way too much of student life. The dorm setting is very isolated. The professors I have had are actually pretty good, though, which is pretty much the one thing keeping my experience bearable. I have been impressed in how much most of the professors care about their subject, especially in the business school. However, this school lacks the friendly and welcoming community of dedicated students I was expecting when I came. The school tries to screw you, as well. They give out tickets to try to make a profit and hope students don't try to appeal them. I'm excited to leave to a more caring community at the end of the year."
Senior,2,"Indiana University has a beautiful campus, however poorly invests money in renovations which is very frustrating. For example, shipping an old carillon (from a part of town nobody visits nor cares about) to Holland in order to renovate it, while claiming there is not enough money for student scholarships or building renovations. Business-related buildings are nice, while others like Ballantine, Jordan, and Swain are in terrible need of repair. The heat vents will often make cracking noise so loud that professors struggle to focus on lecturing.    In my four years there was at least 7 gas leaks, which makes you feel rather unsafe. Speaking of safety,  according to mobile phone alerts rape or theft occur on a weekly basis, sometimes there are armed robberies."
Niche User,2,"I have a love/hate relationship with Indiana University. On one hand, I loved the school everything about it, but on the other hand, I made a mistake going there, and they were quite unforgiving and unkind. I made the mistake of going full throttle into a university without worrying about the money involved with it. I know it was my fault, but I wasn't thinking at the time. I went to school for less than a semester before withdrawing from all of my courses because I couldn't afford it. The administration had no sympathy for me, as I was kicked out from my dorm- having to pay for my schooling, without receiving any credits for the work that I had done. Now I am left with only the experience, and a ton of money which I am in debt to them."
Sophomore,2,"After transferring here, I lost my scholarship and wasn't given many other financial opportunities.  The staff working in the bursar office were not helpful!"
College Junior,2,"Freshman year I was placed in an upperclassmen dorm because the incoming class was so big. I had almost no interaction with other residents and the cost was outrageous. I was finally able to move to a different dorm at the end of the first semester because I couldn't afford where I was, but was placed in a dorm that was still rather expensive. I spoke less than ten words to other members of my floor once I moved there, despite trying to be social and friendly.

Sophomore year I applied for a university apartment, but upon arriving to it at the start of the semester found it to be unlivable. There were cockroaches, the front door didn't close, the windows didn't lock, and it was tiny, all for a monthly rent that was staggering compared to non-university apartments. I was able to move to a different apartment that cost even more and had to pay a large fee in order to do so. While this apartment is nicer, it has a lot of issues that the staff claims will be fixed, but have not been addressed four weeks after I turned in my room assessment information."
College Junior,2,"It seems like this university is trying to trip you up at every step, and every time you trip it costs a ridiculous amount of money. I feel mild panic on a semi-regular basis that I will not be able to afford my bills. While most students tend to focus more on partying, I focus on my schoolwork and on employment, and, as a result, have not made many friends and have had no experiences that fit into the ""college is the best time of your life"" cliche. This school cares far more about its athletes than it cares about its academically oriented students. Students with C- averages get full rides because they can throw a ball, but a student with a 4.0 has to work twenty hours a week on top of taking nineteen credit hours just to be able to eat. I really look forward to graduation, not because this school has given me anything close to a bright outlook on my future, but because every second I am at this place is miserable."
College Sophomore,2,The dorm options are awful because they dont have any space.
College Junior,2,A lot of buildings don't get cleaned as often as they could. Bug problems are a common issue for a lot of dorms.
College Junior,2,"Kinda sucked. Super expensive for a crappy, old place.

Community wasn't that great. Activities were too PG-13."
College Junior,2,"Greek life has a really bad reputation. It's very costly. There is definitely a social and cultural divide between Greeks and non-Greeks.

I don't think Greek life on the IUB campus really has a positive impact. Their philanthropies aren't all that influential."
College Sophomore,2,Multiple murders in area making me feel unsafe.
College Freshman,2,"Although the problem of sexual assault is prevalent on IU's campus, I believe it is more of a national problem"
College Sophomore,2,"If you haven't been keeping up on the news then you've missed a lot of the IU Greek life drama that has been happening. Within one school year, IU kicked of two, yes TWO, fraternities and put many of the other fraternities on probation. A couple of sororities have also been in trouble with the university. Some of these instances have deserved consequences and some of those consequences were invoked by the National Headquarters of the organizations. But as a whole, Greek life at Indiana is not respected and as a member of the community, I do not feel respected by the university. Joining Greek life at IU used to be the best decision but now it just means you have a target on your back. Everyone is waiting for your downfall and no one cares about your achievements. It is sad but brutally true. I hope that in the next couple of years we can fix this relationship with the university and begin to be treated like IU students and not reckless kids."
College Sophomore,2,"One class has been very close to a joke.  I'm constantly getting different grades on assignments, missing plenty of points because I'm not presenting information the way the teacher wants.  I simply cannot understand the teacher's logic and its frustrating.  The other class I have no issues with."
College Freshman,2,Life is hard in general. It is difficult to adjust to real life and do what needs to be done. It is hard to make friends. It is hard to keep up with the academics. While it may not be a huge struggle for many other freshman it is hard for me.
College Junior,2,This past year many out of the blue assaults on women walking home from studying/etc. have been reported and it is unsettling. A few of these happen on campus on paths that I walk everyday.
College Junior,2,"The majority of people involved with the Greek system are a disruption to life at IU. Not all but most have snobby and entitled attitudes. Having worked many different jobs in town, the worst customers that I have had are those who belong to Greek life because it appears that they have never worked a day I their life and do now understand the concepts of patience and tact."
College Freshman,2,I do not care for Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"Indiana University is one of the biggest party schools (I think it is ranked 5th in the US) and that is directly related to how much crime their is (especially sexual assault, mostly from frat houses). But support groups and doctors for victims are advertised and very often available."
College Freshman,2,"It's a big deal, but if you don't rush with the rest of dorm floor, say good-bye to most of the friends you made first semester."
College Junior,2,The Greeks seem to operate on some sort of hive mind. All the frat boys are the same and all the sorority sisters are the same.
College Freshman,2,Wright Quad is the absolute worst. Avoid at all costs.
College Sophomore,2,You're basically paying $730 per month per person for no air conditioning and a communal bath that gets cleaned once every 3 weeks.
College Freshman,2,Almost everyone drinks and it's quite common to overhear conversations between students discussing Adderall usage for studying.
College Freshman,2,Greeks only associate with other greeks
College Sophomore,2,"Safety in general may not be of a huge concern, but safety to minorities (African-Americans & Women in particular) is a huge problem with many of us not feeling completely safe at our school."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't feel safe or  unsafe. I am constantly warned about walking alone, so much that I actually am more scared that I first was. There are little emergency buttons around campus and apparently police can get to you in like 90 seconds but still, I don't feel the greatest around on my own."
College Sophomore,2,"There's a lot of drinking on this campus. Almost every weekend night, I would hear someone throwing up in my dorm's bathroom."
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of meaningless busy work assigned by unorganized, inconsiderate teachers. Every teacher thinks their class is the most important thing ever so you're going to have to deal a lot with their pretentious attitudes."
College Sophomore,2,"From what I've heard, the workout facility is nice. It's a little hard to get to though. IU spends a lot of tuition money on sports teams while they could be using that money to build new classroom facilities."
College Freshman,2,"The security on campus is not as good as they advertise it.  There are emergency towers and student police patrolling, however, there is no guarantee that the police will reach the call in time.  Crime is pretty frequent, but that is expected being as big of a campus as we are."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The actual food, and housing facilities at Indiana University are nice. The rooms are spacious and most dorm buildings have private bathrooms. They offer nice lounges, study rooms, TV's cable etc. They do lack kitchens which does suck. The RPS staff at IU is absolutely horrible. I hate to compare anyone to Nazi's but it comes pretty close. Stay clear."
College Sophomore,2,"As a member of a middle-tier sorority at IU, I can say that sorority recruitment is definitely insanely more difficult than it will probably ever be for a guy to try and rush a frat. Recruitment has a lot of rules, deadlines, practices, fines, etc. that male rush doesn't have, so to be a guy rushing at IU is to be lucky. However, the tier system at IU is completely and totally out of hand. Top tier sororities and fraternities legitimately think they are so much better than those at the bottom of the tier system, making them super shallow and unworthy of all the fame they get on campus. There are so many wonderful people in lower tiers but few in the middle and no one at the top will notice them because of this stupid and outdated ""caste"" system. In addition, IU is incredibly unfair when it comes to treating all fraternities and sororities with respect and equality. Top tier fraternities and sororities seem to get away with more instances of hazing, sexual assault and partying that middle and lower tier frats and sororities wouldn't get away with. One specific organization is Delta Tau Delta or ""Delts"": despite how many sexual assault and drug cases they seem to have, they never face repercussions, lose their house or get kicked off campus even though other fraternities that commit lesser charges have received harsher punishments. I have and never will feel comfortable in any environment in which members of ""Delts"" are present, however, IU doesn't seem to take that fear of compromised safety into account when ""punishing"" these gentlemen."
College Junior,2,It was not what I wanted.
College Sophomore,2,I haven't gotten any scholarships that i applied for.
College Freshman,2,"Quite hours are not respected at all, sometimes they are not even enforced by the RAs, in addition, there is no control whatsoever regardless of dorm visitations and guests who stay the night over."
College Freshman,2,"Scholarships require a lot of work, I know I need them, but the chances of actually getting a scholarship (if you don't apply for mutliple) is really low, considering the number of students that apply for the same scholarship."
College Sophomore,2,"For me, it was very difficult to get in touch with financial aid in the beginning of the year. I think it was mostly due to the high volume of people trying to do the same thing. I don't blame them, I just wish my experience had been better."
College Freshman,2,"there are dorms that are very nice and new. However if you can't pay for those dorms you are stuck with the majority of the dorms that are rusty, old systems. They haven't been able to put a clean working water fountain in my dorm all year. There is a roach problem that the university continues to ignore because of the fact that we are a co-op dorm, so we do a chore for them to cut out housing bill because some of us struggle to find the funds to pay for this extremely expensive school. The social atmosphere is fantastic. Networking is easy and fun here. The value of the courses here is also outstanding. However, beware of the rape culture here. IU does address it, if they have to. There are still many cases that are swept under the rug or not reported because ""they were off campus""."
College Sophomore,2,"I have a scholarship from the state of Indiana, but the process of getting the money applied as a transfer student took three months and it took crying in front of the financial aid staff to actually get something done."
College Senior,2,"If you don't want a frat party, it can be hard to find where to go without word of mouth."
College Freshman,2,Depends on who you are on if you get financial aid or scholarships.
College Freshman,2,"The campus strictness is nearly nonexistent. I cannot count how many times I have seen seemingly underage teenagers charging down the street in a drunken stupor. My dorm hall is always noisy, but someone usually comes and tells the other students to quiet down."
College Freshman,2,Parties are easy to find but the Greek houses are always throwing down.
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive any aid, I definitely needed some, but I figured it out."
College Freshman,2,"Know the right people, you can get out of anything"
College Freshman,2,Think Patagonia. Everyone spending daddy's money.
College Freshman,2,The Financial aid process was/ confusing.
Recent Alumnus,2,Its mostly just greasy food and the same food every day.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is pretty much all online and if you go to the financial aid office they pretty much do nothing for you. It is so expensive and very hard to get any financial aid or student loans. I ended up having to get some private loans and they are killing me now. I wish I would have had someone really help me with the process and explain all of my options.
College Junior,2,"I got small scholarships, but I'm a great student from out of state and I should have gotten more. My parents aren't fans of paying $50k a year for me to go here out of state but it's cheaper than CA in state tuition. I would say it's worth the money, all things considered"
College Junior,2,"Most people know nothing about the sexual assault problem and even if they do, no one cares. IUPD only busts people for underage drinking. I walk to a basketball game, get harassed and stalked and the next block, they are standing there with breathalyzers, no concern for anything but their money from drinking tickets."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is pointless and the girls are mean.
Junior,1,"The worst University I have EVER known or heard of. I don't even know where to begin. The ONE & ONLY good thing about it is the pretty campus. They had thousands of students living in mold-infested dorms. They did NOTHING about it. People were getting severely ill. 1 person ended their life over it. Another person almost died bc of an allergy to it. They moved the student into 3 different mold infested dorms. They denied it was their fault. The Professors in Kelly are incompetent & childish. 1 finance class, the entire class failed & the professor sent memes about it to the class.  Another professor made fun of the student who was dying from the mold infestation. He made her do presentations when she had a doctor's note from the hospital excusing her. borderline psychotic. Need to register your icore classes? Sorry, Kelly doesn't have enough availability for all students. So they'll have to take them later. I wouldn't even give them 1 star. IU has NO concern for their students."
Freshman,1,"I am currently a student. IU is EXCEEDINGLY under-equipped. They have far too staff members per student leading to wait times of up to ONE MONTH to speak to an advisor in order to switch my schedule around. Aside from that, they ask that you pay upwards of $2,000 for a ""meal plan"" that only gives you $740 to use at the dorm cafeterias. If the cafeteria is not in your dorm (only about 1/6 buildings has one) you will walk 20 minutes. The cafeteria is exceedingly understaffed as well. Wait times for food have been up the THREE HOURS after placing an order. While on the topic of campus food, I have consistently had my orders messed up. Every student deals with this. The food to begin with is of the lowest possible quality though they boast great, luxury ingredients.  The order will more often than not be messed up to the point of just throwing it away. (Actual examples: water from nasty eggs made everything in my meal soggy, burnt burgers, pizza with no cheese, uncooked potatoes/pasta)."
Freshman,1,TRASH. Unorganized. Overall ridiculous expectations for online organization and workload. All students I have personally spoken to have said the same.
Junior,1,"Online classes were taken during the COVID-19 pandemic. Professors made classes intentionally harder, graded tests more strictly, and refused to bump grades when the difference between me dropping the class grade and taking it with a MASSIVE boost to my GPA was a literal fraction of a percent."
Freshman,1,"I went to IU for one year and this school is beyond miserable for so many reasons. As a science major my opportunities for undergrad research/internships were slim to none. The pre professional program was an absolute joke. Most of my teachers barely speak any English and do not deliver information in a way that anyone can understand. Don’t even get me started on Greek life. Do not expect to go out if you’re not in Greek life. Rushing sororities here was insanely degrading. ZERO DIVERSITY. Literally look up the demographics. Bloomington is sketchy as hell. Honestly, this school made me so emotionally drained that I felt like a robot. Same thing everyday in the middle of a small town in Indiana. I will never understand why people say great things about this school when it’s so depressing. Really think twice before you spend a fortune going to this horrible school."
Freshman,1,"If I could give no stars I would. I went to IU Bloomington for one year and could not wait to leave. The university will do anything to make a buck off of you. Parking enforcement will give you a ticket if you are parked in a permanently half empty lot. Parking enforcement towed my car when I had it parked in my dormitory parking lot while I was trying to move out. There is also extremely limited vehicle parking on campus, so everything is a near thirty minute walk. The interactions with staff are impersonal. Professors have no care in the world if you pass or fail. The college tuition is outrageously expensive for non resident students and extremely not worth the experience. Many of the dorms were riddled with mold. Campus dining options are low quality. The weather is extremely harsh in the winter.  So, if you are planning on attending IU Bloomington, good luck and plan on having some of these experiences."
Junior,1,"Indiana University fails to prioritize student safety and their current systems in place perpetuate the culture of sexual violence on our campus. Furthermore, the school retaliates against survivors who speak out about their experiences. The current education administrators have in place for students (literally) encourages behavior that falls short of consent. I used to be proud to go to IU. Now, I am forever changed by my experiences. The number one takeaway is that Indiana University has the power to drastically decrease sexual violence and they choose not to. I am working diligently to make sure what happened to me never happens to anyone else. I have started the conversation on campus and continuing to create resources for students and survivors. I see a brighter tomorrow at IU Bloomington."
Freshman,1,"Overall, this school is really simple. Come here:

-If you want to do business (the stereotypical profit-hungry type),
-If you like to party, drink, do drugs, eat DISGUSTING food, and see no issue in profiting from a corrupted Greek life system with no moral standards,
-If you want to study music (classical or jazz), & don't mind coexisting with immature peers who talk about partying 24/7.

I personally know I'm doing everything in my power to get out of here as soon as humanly possible."
Freshman,1,"Indiana University was such a disappointment. Being in the Kelley School of Business is very prestigious, but is not worth the lack of environment on campus, terrible food, and possibly some of the worst dorms. Just simply my opinion."
College Junior,1,"Greek life is awful. The process of joining in itself is terrible -- I went through rush and it was one of the worst things I've ever been through. They aren't integrated into non-Greek organizations. Women are constantly sexually assaulted in the fraternity houses and there are tons of double standards. However, if you aren't Greek, it's hard to be a part of main campus events such as IUDM and Little 500."
College Sophomore,1,As a non-Greek I think the system is a waste and causes more problems than helping the community. Just last semester an on-campus fraternity lost their house when a video of them doing something inappropriate in the house surfaced online. The only point of Greek life is its own existence -- nothing of substance outside of a group of men/women who wear random Greek letters.
College Sophomore,1,"Parties at IU suck. They are very exclusive and hard to find. If you're not part of Greek life, don't expect to go to a lot of parties. Getting to parties is rather dangerous and Uber is horrible in Bloomington. It's overpriced and not always available."
College Sophomore,1,All I hear about IU is that they have a raging party scene. This is so false. The parties suck.
College Sophomore,1,"Diversity does not exist at IU. We do have a lot of international students (mainly from China). I have overheard many racist comments towards them, primarily from white Americans."
College Sophomore,1,"Just during the Fall 2015 semester, there were three reported rapes. Who knows how many went unreported. The descriptions sent out about the perpetrators were very vague and non descriptive. This gave me the feeling that IU and the police department do not care about the safety of women on this campus. The forest behind the Sample Gates is nicknamed ""rape forest."" There was an actual assault there during Fall 2015. While all these horrible things are happening, the police are out busting peaceful students for smoking a little weed when they should be actively hunting for the rapists on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"I'm from out of state and I had never heard of the Kelley School of Business until I came here. This school is so hyped up for absolutely nothing. A degree from IU is not reputable at all, especially for a interior design major."
College Sophomore,1,"All I've truly learned at this school is that effort is worth absolutely nothing. This school is huge, so naturally, the teachers care less and less about their students as the semesters go by. I felt like I was just a number on a long list at this school. I'm transferring in the Spring and I'm nervous I won't be able to keep up at my new school just because IU has prepared me so little for the real world."
College Sophomore,1,"I lived in Eigenmann. It was pretty decent, but it had its problems like most of the other buildings on IU's campus. It's a hassle to get from dorms to class buildings. The bus system is very unreliable. My hall was never clean. The bathroom sinks were always clogged."
College Sophomore,1,"I think Greek life is, hands down, the worst thing a university can condone. Greek life involuntarily supports institutional racism, ableism, and misogyny. Greek life is what fuels IU's rape culture. To make up for all these horrible things, Greeks will try to make themselves and everyone else feel better about it by claiming they are a philanthropic organization and that they need to maintain a certain GPA to get in and stay in when in reality, sororities and fraternities are just an excuse to have meaningless parties where women are deliberately dehumanized. Greek also promotes a culture of conformity. All the girls where the same thing, talk the same, and do the same things. The same goes for fraternities. If you don't go Greek at IU, you are automatically segregated and thought of as an outsider."
College Freshman,1,"Majority of all greek students I have met, seem to be fake and snobby."
College Freshman,1,"I got very little from the financial aid office.  For a 10,000 dollar every semester, they only give me 800 dollars.  I might just have to leave Indiana University because we cannot afford that kind of billing.  I think the absolute worst of IU's financial aid office because they do not help and they do not listen.  After crying and literally begging one day, they just told me to stop trying."
College Sophomore,1,"It seems like there are very few options RPS gives for helping you find off campus housing, if any."
College Freshman,1,"The scholarships are extremely competitive. Don't expect to get one unless you got over a 4.0 gpa, because I did, and i still didn't get any scholarships. The people I went to for help at the student center were very rude. They did not help me find other scholarships the school offered. They even told me that I should not go to IU."
College Freshman,1,Barely any financial aid offered to most students
Recent Alumnus,1,I doubt if I ever have or ever will despised anything as much as I despise the IU Greek system.
College Senior,1,"Food is expensive, bland, and the same thing is offered basically everywhere. The only decent place (Forest) is insanely expensive even with the card discount."
College Freshman,1,"The Greeks contribute to the issues of racism and misogyny that we see in today's society. They think they are the entirety of Indiana University and without them our campus would be purposeless. They throw all the big parties, but we've already had one student DIE this year in a sorority house at a party. I can't stand the Greeks. They're also rude to non-Greeks."
Recent Alumnus,1,A lot of sexual assault has happened over the years and walking alone is very scary. I want to feel comfortable walking with a friend around campus. Too many bad things have happened and some times police just let it go.
College Junior,1,"The midwest in general isn't great with food, but as someone with non-voluntary food restrictions, go somewhere else if you want food options abound. I would still choose IU knowing all that I know now, but the food is bad and I eat once a day (mostly off campus even with a meal plan) because of the limited options. But I'm from California, so I'm spoiled."
College Freshman,1,I applied after November and didn't get a scholarship as a freshman even if I would've been eligible.
College Junior,1,Resident assistants were very strict in my building freshman year.
College Junior,1,There is a tier-system for Greek life. It is not a comfortable or inviting environment.
Recent Alumnus,1,I had a horrible experience in the dorms with my pot luck roommate selling drugs and my RA doing nothing about it. It got so bad I was forced to move into a closet by myself in another dorm. My roommate and her friend were later convicted of being suppliers and kicked out of school. It was horrible and it really ruined my making friends and experience in school
College Sophomore,1,"I really don't like how small the city is. I'm from a 150,000+ person city, and being here feels like I'm in the middle of nowhere. There's a small mall that is okay, but there are no big sports teams and almost no life in the city if you leave campus"
College Senior,1,"Indiana University Greek life is the most competitive system there is. Greek life for boys is very simple and easy to join, however for girls it is very difficult and causes a lot of girls to transfer or even lower their self-esteem. The Greek life for girls is very unfair and should be altered. Greek life is very big at IU so not getting into a house for a girl is very hard on them and it is shoved in their faces for the rest of their college career."
College Sophomore,1,Same food everyday. Becomes gross and repititive
College Sophomore,1,It's expensive to live in a dorm without air and elevators
College Sophomore,1,"The honor code is what they're most strict about and is the worst process to go through. It's the professors word against yours, even if you haven't done anything wrong."
Recent Alumnus,1,IU Administration doesn't take sexual assults very seriously. There very low key about it. They'll help students if it gets reported. Only if it gets reported.
Recent Alumnus,1,Campus housing is so expensive!!!!!!!!! I would avoid on-campus housing at all costs if I wasn't using financial aid. Financial aid is pretty much housing.
Recent Alumnus,1,IU only gives out meret based financial aid to people that have amazing grades. It relies to much on the Federal government for free handouts to students. Everyone gets the Pell Grant and loans to have to pay back. This place is actually very expensive to attend school. Very little aid.
College Junior,1,I do not participate because it is so unpleasant for many reasons.
College Freshman,1,"Both dorms I've lived in have lacked air conditioning, and neither Resident Assistant was very present. People keep their doors closed and it's a horribly unfriendly atmosphere."
College Freshman,1,For me it's why I want to leave. This school has huge Greek life. If you don't go greek it's very hard to have a life because all the friends you made in the dorms are going greek. The girl's are obsessed with Frat guys and the Frat's and Sororities just stick to their stereotypical norms and accept people that are exactly like them.
College Freshman,1,I hate the cold. But that might just be me.
College Freshman,1,Kelley is really hard to get into. You can't get worse than a B. Certain classes are tough to not get below a B.
College Freshman,1,"Indiana weather is extremely random and classes are rarely canceled despite monsoons, blizzards or heat waves"
College Freshman,1,"Police and RAs don't care about the dorms. People in dorms do what they want, when they want. However, outside the dorms, they'll pull you over/arrest you for walking drunk. However, punishment is usually student court and some BS alcohol classes you take and then go get wasted afterwards. "
College Freshman,1,"Greek Life is awful. Too many rapes/sexual assaults/deaths/alcohol poisoning occur. Frats aren't diverse, neither are the sororities. Just a bunch of spoiled rich kids living on daddy's check. The parties all seem to be boring, which reflects the lack of diversity or personality the Greek system has. Non-Greek students (Or GDIs, for God Damned Independents) loathe Greeks because the Greeks constantly talk about how great they are and how everyone should rush. Greeks claim to be philanthropic, but it's all just a ploy. They ""give"" thousands to charity, but they haze their members into raising it. Also, hazing is a big problem - the frats pretend they don't, but they do. I know people who've called me crying because their sorority tried to get them to do cocaine because it ""makes you lose weight."" Disgusting."
College Freshman,1,"As someone who knows three people who've been sexually assaulted at this school, it needs to stop. I work for the student newspaper and it seems like there's a new date rape/sexual assault every week. Students have gone missing and never returned. There've been armed robberies of local stores. Drugs are a HUGE business at IU - I have people in my building offering me meth/heroin. Alcohol is another huge business - 21 year olds will stop by my dorm with mysterious boxes and then leave without them. Next thing I know the vodka is flowing through the rooms. Police ignore everything, all they do is write parking tickets."
College Freshman,1,"IU athletics are boring. Football team is awful, basketball is overhyped (just a reason to drink), and other sports are shoved out of the way. The IU Soccer Team won National Titles, but is ignored. It's a shame."
College Freshman,1,"I came to IU under the impression that it was relatively drug free. Orientation leaders, professors, advisors etc. all said that IU had very strong anti-drug policies - it's all a lie. I've seen students smoking weed on street corners, drinking peer on benches next to academic buildings etc. Three drug dealers live on my floor. My neighbor got smashed on Xanex and Oxy and our RA did nothing. RAs try to seem cool and let too much go. Cops are either idiots or don't care, as they apparently can't identify a beer bottle from 30 feet away. "
College Junior,1,They do not have money to give students who are not the best students but who need it the most.
College Freshman,1,Winter's are harsh and the campus is horrible at plowing/salting. Classes and office hours get cancelled often from rain/flooding or snow/ice.
College Sophomore,1,The meter parking is new and expensive. There are never spots and the parking pass distribution is not fair
College Freshman,1,"It's the worst in the sense that so many people take part in it, and that makes it very sad, because they're supposed to come to IU for schooling reasons, but instead many are going to the parties like crazy."
College Junior,1,They party a lot and promote underage drinking.
College Freshman,1,Parking is horrible at IU.  It's expensive and there never seem to be any spots.
College Senior,1,"The campus of Indiana University and the town of Bloomington in general, have terrible parking policies and options. Every permit costs an arm and a leg and the ""good permits"" (permits that allow you to park on campus) are only accessible by certain people. Parking somewhere without a permit is so expensive, it's unmanageable for a poor college student (like myself) to afford it. Most students are left using their legs to get them to and across this massive campus, or the poorly operated bus system."
College Sophomore,1,Never any spots and half of the passes are impossible to get if you are a current student living on campus. Parking spaces are extremely hard to find and in inconvenient places.

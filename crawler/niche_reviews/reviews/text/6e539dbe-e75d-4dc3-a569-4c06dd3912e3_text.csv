Niche User,5,Awesome school!! I am doing all online and all the professors are very supportive! And make time to meet with you! I would recommend someone to look into Notre Dame
Niche User,5,Notre Dame is amazing and I love attending and would recommend this school to undergraduates and graduates.
Graduate Student,5,The teachers are wonderful! I really enjoy my classes and I appreciate that I can take all of my classes online.
Graduate Student,5,The teachers are wonderful! I really enjoy my classes and I appreciate that I can take all of my classes online.
Freshman,5,"I did not take any online classes although due to the pandemic, online classes should be well considered, the campus is very nice and interacting with other students are very important, you get to learn multiple cultures of a lot of intelligent individuals."
Sophomore,5,I am a student athlete at the College. It is a small campus with a family atmosphere. There are plenty of opportunities to get one on one time with teachers. The staff wants everyone to excel!
Freshman,5,I have enjoyed my first year that this school and an excited to start my second. I am having trouble finding the money to say at the school but I really want to go back. I have made so many friends and really enjoy the swim team classes are fantastic and the professors are really accommodating.
Sophomore,5,"Notre Dame is a great local school in the Cleveland area, they really have an open campus where you can pretty much see anybody and meet anyone. You also have the opportunity to get help with your academics around the campus with the different tutoring opportunities and get help with essays and they have so many great campus opportunities that you can participate in as well"
Sophomore,5,"As an adult student returning to school, Notre Dame has been nothing but excellent. I highly recommend their adult programs!!"
Sophomore,5,Notre dame college is a home for me the staff is nice the students all bond and first gen took me in as their baby bird i love notre dame
Sophomore,5,"While attending Notre Dame College, I love how the campus is small. I also love how there are many resources around campus. For example, if you need help with school work, there are tutors, professors that will help you. This college is perfect for someone who doesn't want to attend a big college."
Niche User,5,It was fun and I love the environment and I especially loved the football game. I have wanted to go to this place my entire life and I want to study animals and science. I love notre dame and I hope to be there someday!
Freshman,5,"the college is located in a beautiful suburban area and is not very big, with 15,00 students it is a good catholic college for someone who wants the experience but not a big crowd. the teachers and staff are very friendly and the open door policy with the professers is very nice. there is so much to do around the campus"
Niche User,5,The college is small but well put together they have an amazing staff and wonderful sport teams. all teachers have an open door policy with students and tutoring is always offered.
Freshman,5,"Coming into NDC I had heard mixed reviews. The poor reviews are so false. The campus is beautiful and the seasons you endure here make it so much fun. The professors are here to help you and make sure you succeed well into your profession.  The old classrooms make it feel like you go to A prestigious university. The food here... yeah that sucks. Everyone is involved in athletics, so if you aren't an athlete don't come.  The parties are extremely underrated. Baseball houses throw the absolute best parties and it is always a good time. The worst parties are usually thrown by the football team. But they still rock. Cleveland Ohio is a happening place to be for not only school but a social life as well! NDC IS THE PLACE TO BE AND THE GIRLS ARE SO HOT! LETS FALCON GO!"
College Sophomore,5,"For Athletes, This school is a dream come true. You get the opportunity to play a sport, and make friends, while getting a college degree"
College Sophomore,5,We have great teachers and Notre Dame College really prepares you for your career
College Sophomore,5,We Have our own police service on campus individual to Notre Dame College. Police ride on bikes late at night and patrol campus constantly
College Sophomore,5,"Notre Dame College is a great school, where the teachers, coaches, and administrators really care about the student sucess"
Recent Alumnus,5,"its great , the online website shows how ASU really cares for its students"
Sophomore,4,I did not take online classes but the teaches have been though with their use of Zoom and our online admissions site
Sophomore,4,"This school make you feel like family and does a excellent job teaching you in whatever your major is. Though small, this school keeps you busy and will always find a group you can relate too."
Sophomore,4,"I took online courses due to COVID-19. The teachers were very easy to communicate with, and the platforms were easy to follow."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the small size of the campus and the idea that you have a lot of one on one time with your professors since the class sizes are smaller. However, with the campus being on the smaller size, depending on your major you will most likely have the same professor for almost all of your classes. This may not be too beneficial if you dislike their class structure or the way they teach."
Niche User,4,Football games are great. Very fun and campus is always clean and never dirty would like to see more security and more employees
Niche User,4,"It is a breathtaking university t o attend, the fall season is when the campus is at its best view and it is so clean."
Sophomore,4,"At my time at Notre Dame College so far I have appreciated the people I've met the most, I've met a good group of guys who have the same goals and morals as myself. Secondly, I liked the dorm life, the dorm life taught me how to provide for myself by giving me a feeling of what its like to live on my own."
College Junior,4,"Courses and professors are pretty good at this school.  Courses are pretty easy to get into and most class sizes don't exceed more than 25-30 people and there are usually 1-2 sections of the class.  Depending on the professor, your class will be great or terrible.  Some professors are really good (meaning they only assign homework to reenforce their lesson or a study guide for a test, they have lots of time for office hours, they don't give a lot of busy work, their lecture is interactive and interesting to listen to, etc).  Some professors are terrible (meaning they assign tons of busy work, they are unmotivated to teach/explain something during class that is part of an exam, they let students skip class on a regular basis, they use another professor's work instead of creating their own materials, they let students cheat on their exam without any consequence (which breaks the academic code of conduct), etc).  The topics covered in class are very extensive and go into detail in upper level courses."
College Freshman,4,I need this degree so that i will have a good future
College Freshman,4,My school is well protected
College Freshman,4,The rooms are set up in an apartment type style and it is very nice.
College Freshman,4,From what i have witnessed so far my schools athletics are top notch!
College Freshman,4,I have only attended my school for one semester and I loved every bit of it!
College Sophomore,4,"Not alot of housing options, but, everything is clean and everyone is friendly"
College Sophomore,4,Pretty much everyone at Notre Dame College plays a sport.
College Freshman,4,I love my school the teachers are very understanding and caring and push you to do your best.
College Student,4,"The courses and professors are very good. If you have accounting classes to take, Ms. Strousse is the one to take, she is a great teacher and really enjoys being there every single day and teaching us students. She really helped me to enjoy accounting and flourish and do really well."
College Student,4,Career Services is amazing! They have helped me so much when it comes to interviews and practicing them and also with finding internships. they have helped me so much since I've been at school and I owe a lot of my success to them.
College Student,4,"I feel very safe, the police and RA's do a good job of always being available when we need them for anything, whether it be an issue with a friend or bigger with alcohol or drugs. We are a very family friendly atmosphere where everyone looks out for each oteh and makes sure they are being smart and doing the right thing."
College Student,4,"I think the dorms on this campus are good for the students and for the size it works. There was a new set of dorms recently built that are very nice and are really like apartment style and they are great! The best part is the residence halls for the most part are close to classes and to the main buildings, which helps when people are running late, they can still be on time. The social atmosphere is great! everyone is really easy to get along with and I have met many great friends in the halls and almost 24/7 we are in the lobby together when we don't have class talking, watching TV and having a good time with each other!"
College Student,4,"My favorite experience about being at the school I am currently at is how nice the students and faculty members are. Everywhere you go people are smiling or laughing and just enjoying each others company and friendships. People seem to value each other and after being at Notre Dame College for a year, I really can say I feel the same way. My classmates and friends are all nice and they like to have fun when we have some free time, but they also know when its time to be serious and do homework or study. It's a really nice balance of fun and school and it has helped me to succeed and even exceed my expectations. I would definitely choose this school if I could redo my choice. It was a great fit for me and I have met many people who have changed my life for the better."
College Junior,4,I feel safe and i like walking on campus at night because i do not have to worry about safety
College Junior,4,It was great because i felt like they cared about me just like the rest of the incoming freshman
College Freshman,4,The facilities at my school are all some what new and very well taken care of.
College Freshman,4,Being apart of my school's bowling team has made my first year of college one to remember.
College Freshman,4,"Safety is really important, there are always cops walking around outside!"
College Freshman,4,Teachers are all really nice! Most of the classes are super easy too!
College Freshman,4,They offer work study programs and classes are available at all times to work with your work schedule
College Freshman,4,"It's great for academics, just not much to do outside of the school work"
Recent Alumnus,4,Had a blast living in the dorms. Very fun and exciting to meet new people. South was awesome!
Recent Alumnus,4,Great support from the school. Loved playing lacrosse!
Recent Alumnus,4,"As I got up to my senior level course it started getting very hard, but rhw professors were with me the whole way. Was a great experience."
Recent Alumnus,4,I interned for 8 months and got several job offers from that internship. I value my degree so much and it had helped in my career path.
College Freshman,4,My overall experience at NDC is great. I honestly love it here. I love how everyone knows everyone and no one is really outcasted. I love the enviroment and I love how the people here are generally nice. Everyone makes you feel welcome.
College Freshman,4,"75% of the student population is made up of athletes and that is represented in all the social cliques. If you are not an athlete, you are pretty much an outcast."
College Student,4,"The Athletic program is actually really good. Like most schools, football and cheer are the more ""important"" sports. You will see more people doing things for, with, and about these two teams then you will with any other on campus. That being said, if you are an athlete on campus, you are treated very well for the most part. It is definitely an athletic focused school."
College Sophomore,4,Notre Dame's rigorous curriculum and well known reputation of excellence open doors
College Sophomore,4,Notre Dame college is extremely challenging.
College Junior,4,the school is pretty average about students' academic/social lives
College Junior,4,"they are attractive, smart, and nice!"
College Junior,4,The school has a lot of school spirit when it comes to sports!
College Junior,4,"I had to get really good grades. The important criteria for admission is fairly good grades, letter of recommendations, TEAS scores, and the right prerequisites."
College Sophomore,4,Great school spirited only for center sports
College Sophomore,4,A lot of international students
College Sophomore,4,The campus makes sure no one is doing anything illegal and if caught they will suffer some form type of consequence.
College Junior,4,I have had to ask questions at times regarding my Financial Aid.  I always get prompt and very professional service from the department.
College Freshman,4,Sports are a big deal here
College Junior,4,Individuals accept each other for who they are.
College Junior,4,"They are outgoing, study oriented and friendly. "
College Freshman,4,There are a great deal of options for dinning off-campus. A great thing about them is that there is a student discount.
College Freshman,4,"I live off-campus and it is pretty good. The only down side is the expense. Although it is very comfortable, the parking is fine, and so is the safety. It is very close to everything one would need and to campus."
College Freshman,4,"One offend hears about students who do drink, but they are all of age. I have yet to see or hear of underage drinking or drug use."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of transportation options to pick from. There are buses. taxis, and walking is also a good option when the weather is not too bad."
College Freshman,4,"The staff and professors are great. I have only finished one semester, yet the connections I have already made with them is something I like."
College Sophomore,4,"The students are from what I see are very accepting. We have a very diverse group of students. I would say the campus is split between color, sexuality and political views. "
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are a big part of the school. When there is a game at the campus almost the whole campus shows up, even the alumni. Just recently the campus built new athletic fields for softball, football, and soccer."
College Sophomore,4,"We have 4 different computer labs on campus. The only thing is that they are not very big. One computer lab is in our tutor center so that where all the athletes are at to fulfill there study table times. The other  computer labs maybe carry 6 computers in each room, so they do tend to fill up fast."
College Sophomore,4,My major is in sports management. At the school they treat us like a business major instead beside the sport classes. The teachers definitely help and get you an internship as it is part of your graduation term. 
College Sophomore,4,At the college I attend I don't notice the drug or alcohol scene. It definitely is not noticeable. But I will say that there are parties frequently on the weekends and it is easy for underage people to get alcohol. 
College Junior,4,Enrolled in the Master's Program for Mild/Moderate Intervention Specialist.  Online classes are very convenience for me since I live 2 hours away from Notre Dame.  Porfessors are very good and instruction and my advisor is wonderful in helping me take the correct classes.
Sophomore,2,"As many of the reviews NDC has not been the best experience. Unless you live on campus and are involved in a sport then its much more difficult to connect with students. Many students are only here due to their athletic scholarship. I don't live on campus, but I've been told the food sucks. I've had good and bad experiences with my teachers. Although most of my teachers have been helpful and the First Gen program is very welcoming. For the most part, I have not enjoyed my experience. If you love a small aspect, being overpriced, and watching your football team lose on a weekly basis this is the school for you!"
College Junior,2,"As I have said previously, athletics here are terrible.  The only people who attend any game is the athletes from other sports.  Our teams mostly loose against other schools.  The students in the program are not the brightest students at the school.  The athletic facilities are out of date and many need repairs and renovation.  Overall, athletics at this school are terrible."
College Freshman,2,We don't have this on campus
College Junior,2,"Not the best place to be, but i do love the people"
College Junior,2,They are okay. Wish they were better!
College Freshman,2,"I wouldnt choose this school again becuase everything they tell you is a lie, the get you here jack up your prices and expect you pay for it. They tell you one before you get here than give you hell once you get here. This place SUCKS!"
College Freshman,2,"Notre Dame College may be a good fit for those who want a ""high school"" feel to a college experience. This is not a good fit for me and I will be transferring soon."
College Freshman,2,The school is located near a bunch of malls and is surrounded by low-grade fast food chains and burger/pizza joints.
College Student,2,"It is fun at the beginning, however, they tend to get old. They are usually at the same houses with the exact same people, doing the exact same things every weekend."
College Sophomore,2,Not a college atmosphere at all you wouldn't even know there was a college if you didn't see the sign
College Sophomore,2,When you are not local its hard to get where you need to go without a car.
College Sophomore,2,The campus id very old and has not been updated. There are not really any places to just study or hangout before class. They could definitely revonate a lot of the buildings.
College Junior,2,"Some of the guys are cool. I would say about 95% of them are athletes. There are a lot of cool guys that will look out for you but there are a few guys who will have female tendencies.
Our campus has some really nice down-to-earth girls. Its easy to make friends but there are also a few female who are extremely rude and mean."
College Junior,2,"My financial aid was fine my freshman year of college but my sophomore year it was messed up. My school lost my paperwork for my Special Circumstances form. With that being delayed, my financial aid ended up getting a little messed up."
College Junior,2,"It snows a lot, but classes hardly get cancelled. They clear the sidewalks and the roads quickly."
College Freshman,2,Notre Dame doesn't have big minority groups on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"If having a morning class, parking is not much of a problem but if someone has an afternoon class, parking can be an issue. Sometimes the Regina parking lot can have some spots open. Parking by the library is not too bad either but it can get filled during the day. It seems to be  mostly the afternoon when those classes are in session that parking can be an issue. The early moring and evening parking usually frees up parking spaces."
College Freshman,2,If you are an athlete at Notre Dame College odds are you will receive a good amount of financial aid. If not your grades will have to be spectacular to get a good amount off.
College Freshman,2,"It is a good college if you strictly doing work but it lacks a social life. You have to be in activity to know people. You can not do anything on campus. Overall, It is very safe."
Recent Alumnus,2,"not to much selection, high cost and not in walking distance to school"
Senior,1,Horrible was put out of an online class without my consent. Online professors were horrible and not professional either. The school as a whole needs new professors and administration.
Senior,1,Professors are horrible and need training on their professionalism. No help for students financially and only want you to come to their school because of the money which is the only thing they care about.
Senior,1,The worst college out here.  Turn back now before it's too late.  The buildings are ancient and falling apart.  The professors are rude and they treat you like you are back in high school.  Athletics are pretty terrible and they barely win any games.  Food is gross and under cooked.  I know many who get food poisoning.  It is not safe to leave campus.
Alum,1,"This school is an absolute joke. They will say absolutely anything to get you enrolled. I have met people who were told they had the program they wanted to study, but it ended up being a lie. The school is obsessed with its enrollment, which usually leads to the dorms being overcrowded. If you aren't lucky enough to get into one of the newer dorm buildings, you will get stuck in the old dorms, which are dirty and infested with bugs. The school wants to keep growing but it won't do anything to fix its problems. Academics and professors are pretty good for the most part, but this school is definitely not worth what they are charging. 99% of the student body is involved in athletics, so if you aren't on a sports team you will probably feel left out. If you are thinking about NDC, do a bit more research than just going on their campus tour.  If you want a small college experience in the Cleveland area, there are other options that give you more for your money."
Sophomore,1,"Notre Dame College is the second college that I have attended and I hate this place more than I hated my old school. The only thing nice that I have to say is that the professors care about you, other than that this place is trash. The food is awful, the students are trashy, the school is dirty and outdated, the coaches are disorganized, and there is absolutely nothing to do here on campus. This school is way to expensive and is giving you absolutely nothing in return for what you are paying."
Freshman,1,"Notre Dame College is a complete joke. Some of the professors are complete jerks, the living conditions in freshman dorms are terrible and the school is overall irritating. If you are not catholic be prepared to be annoyed by the First Year Seminar and Theology courses that you are required to take. Its a dry campus which also sucks and there is nothing to do."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life
College Freshman,1,It is not a good fit for me and I will be transferring as soon as I can.
College Sophomore,1,Campus does not offer Greek life
College Sophomore,1,School has no off campus housing
College Sophomore,1,"The schools parking is ridiculous. If you don't get to class in the morning 20 minuets before class, good luck finding a spot. The school does not require parking permits but should. So some of the students that even live on campus and would take less time to walk from their dorms to class end up driving for the 2 seconds. "
College Junior,1,Its terrible. Every party that gets thrown gets shut down by police. The main spot everyone went to on Thursday nights banned our school because NDC students were fighting.
College Freshman,1,it is in the upper Cleveland area. it gets a lot of weather off of the lake which makes it colder a lot of times than in other areas in Ohio. good if you love a lot of snow in the winter time.
College Junior,1,"For what the tuition is, the facilities are a complete rip-off. our athletic center is barely a center and our classes are jammed between an abandoned high school and a ancient church-looking building."
College Junior,1,horrible. they are slow and the IT people are clueless. the printers never work and the lab is not open 24 hours.
Recent Alumnus,1,I only have two more classes and  I will be finish.  The problem is that I ran out of student loans for undergrad and this school haven't been helpful one bit so I can be finish with my teacher licensure.  It is very discouraging talking to different people and being transferred on the phone from person to person.  I even went to the school to talk to a young lady who I was referred to and it took her for two months to get back with me.  She was not very helpful.  Some students in the grad program told me that she had helped them but I wasn't that successful.
College Sophomore,1,"Dorms Are Limited. Dorms at NDC are cramped and overcrowded.  School has grown way too much, too quickly."
College Sophomore,1,"Off-campus, dining is relatively inexpensive and wholesome.  The cafeteria, however, has some of the most unappealing food I have ever seen in a school cafeteria.  Much of the hot food served is swimming in oil, and there have been numerous incidents in which the meat served was frozen through and even undercooked.  The dining hall is an ""all-you-can-eat"" buffet style for $5.00 (less for breakfast), but how one could eat so much of this re-heated or deep-fried food is beyond me. 
     Some of the cafeteria food is satisfying and borderline healthful, but for a school with so many athletes, I wonder how much thought is put into these meals."

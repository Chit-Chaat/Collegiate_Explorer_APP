Sophomore,5,My online experience was good.  My teachers were a lot more lenient and I actually still learned a fair amount of material.  The transition was smooth overall.
Sophomore,5,"So far I have loved Miami even with being online.  I still learned a lot during my online experience, but one of the best things that I have experienced at Miami is the people.  Everyone I have met has been super nice.  It is really easy to make friends here, and the academics are great."
Junior,5,Due to COVID Ive had to take more classes online than I would like to but the professors are being understanding and making the switch to online learning much easier.
Junior,5,So far my experience at Miami has been great. Ive been given opportunities that I did not feel would be possible anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,"I have loved every second of being at Miami. Everyone there from the students to the staff and the professors are so welcoming and nice. I have made so many friends just within my first year there. The campus is absolutely beautiful, I feel so lucky that I can call it my home. The extracurriculars are amazing, and there is something there for everyone to do, and no one will feel left out."
Sophomore,5,I was a first year student at Miami in 2019-20 and I loved it there! I met so many great people and I really enjoyed my classes. The campus is beautiful and felt like home! The only thing that would've made it better is actually getting to stay for the entire year. I am looking forward to going back in the fall.
Freshman,5,Online classes were great! I was nervous at first about how I would do but the professors made everything super organized and simple.
Senior,5,Great school! Small class sizes make for an intimate setting. Great professors who care about their students success. Great dining halls with plenty of options
Sophomore,5,"A total different experience where I have learned a lot not only academically also about myself, being in an environment where everybody is focus con their goals. The only bad thing is there is not a lot of support for international students such as scholarships, internships, grants for students like me."
Sophomore,5,Honestly at first instance I complained about it but after a couple of days I really love it the way that you can study from home and do your assignments when you decide it. It resulted better that what I supposed it would be
Sophomore,5,Such a great experience! I loved the friends I made and the professors who took extra time to make sure I knew the material.
Junior,5,"I did take some classes online, and all of them were after quarantine started. Some of my professors who are good with technology adjusted well, but taking chem lab online wasn't great, though it was better than standing in a lab for 3 hours. My korean prof. on the other hand, is not great with technology, which I can't blame him for. We just emailed him our homework, but he had no way to monitor accountability. Overall their online classes normally have a great structure and are not too difficult."
Sophomore,5,"I felt that given the quick situation that everyone was thrown into, Miami did a great job and I continued to learn the material.  Professors were available and took the time if I had questions and really felt that some of the professors stepped outside the box with some really cool projects."
Graduate Student,5,"My experience at Miami University was fantastic!  There was a lot of opportunity to be involved in a lot of extracurricular activities and receive quality one on one time with professors and faculty.   I've had a comfortable experience being a minority within the beautiful campus, and would recommend diverse students looking for a great education to consider attending."
Alum,5,I loved the diversity and inclusion. I also loved the student life and opportunities. Everyone was welcoming.
Senior,5,Miami OH has given me an amazing college experience. I am receiving a top notch education but there are also many opportunities socially. Attending Miami is the best decision I have ever made!
Sophomore,5,I'm an introvert but Miami made me feel like I was part of one big family. It's a strong community with great faculty and staff and students. An absolutely beautiful campus.
Sophomore,5,The online experience was amazing.  My teachers were able to rebound very quickly while still upholding expectations and giving us a lot to learn.
Junior,5,"My overall experience at Miami University so far has been one of the best experiences of my life. As a kinesiology/neuroscience student in hopes of earning my Doctorate of Physical Therapy in the near future, my classmates and faculty have pushed me to pursue my goals and prepare me well for my future career aspirations. I am also involved in campus organizations like greek life and Young Life which has allowed me to form great relationships with fellow college students. I have made my best friends here. The feel of the campus, the college town, and the amazing food all come together seamlessly to make Miami such a great school that I get to call home."
Sophomore,5,I am only an upcoming Sophmore but it has been an amazing experience so far. I love all the different activities you can do and the variety of classes you can take.
Junior,5,"I am so lucky that the past two years at Miami University have been amazing. Of course, there have been some ups and downs but throughout it, all the staff, teachers, and friends were always there for me. It's my home away from home and I could not say enough good things about it. I am blessed to be able to receive a great education at this school."
Junior,5,"Although Oxford is a small town, Miami University offers the ideal college experience. If High School Musical was a college, it would be Miami University. Not only is a perfect college town, but the academics and alumni network are unbeatable. Miami will set you up for life."
Freshman,5,I love Miami University. There are so many beautiful views and people on campus. You will leave this school a changed person.
Niche User,5,"I will be attending MU this fall and, when I first visited campus, I was amazed!  It’s such a beautiful town filled with kind people and outstanding restaurants, because of course that is a priority.  The campus is the perfect size to feel like you’re in a small suburban town, but still gives you plenty to do!  That, and Miami has some really fun traditions.  Now I live a good bagel, but I hear no one does it better than Bagel and Deli in Oxford.  And have you heard of broomstick hockey?  This school has such a fun and lively energy that I am so excited to be a part of!"
Junior,5,"Academics wise, this is a good school. Beautiful campus and the party scene is nice. Great professors and the support from the administration is strong. Honestly really nice for a state school."
Niche User,5,"Great campus where students thrive, work together, and excel at their major. A place where kids seem to want excellence and strive to get it. Has great staff that allows kids to have the opportunity to achieve their goals and dreams, while having fun and living their best life. Also, kids get to explore who they are and who they want to be. Endless opportunities outside of class for people who want to have fun and do what they enjoy. Atmosphere is fantastic and the facilities are well kept and makes it feel like a home. Miami is a fantastic campus."
Sophomore,5,I love Miami University. Best decision I have ever made. The faculty treats you well and it feels like a home. My favorite thing about miami is how you could be walking down the street and see someone you know and see someone you have yet to meet. I love how friendly everyone is. however miami is big in greek life (1/3 of our students are greek) and joining my sorority made the campus feel like home.
Alum,5,"Graduated from Miami in 18. I feel like I had an excellent and well-rounded experience. Great education and it's serving me well - I went on to the Peace Corps after graduation, and I was just recently accepted into medical school. Love and Honor"
Alum,5,"Words cannot describe the amazing, loving, and eventful life that I had during my four years at Miami University. I fell in love with my campus, classes, peers, and professors. Miami gave me a life I had never had and introduced me to so many new adventures."
Alum,5,Miami proved to be four of the best years of my life.  I learned far more than was taught in the classroom.  Mother Miami prepared me well for the challenges that followed as a career Air Force  officer and since.
Niche User,5,I love Miami University. Ever since I was a kid it was my dream to attend there. Finally I have been able to step foot and experience the college life that I always wanted. Miami has been great! I recommend it to all my friends.
Alum,5,I loved the environment and the amazing community at Miami University.  I am proud to be a Miami University alumnae.
Freshman,5,"While I am not officially a student at Miami University yet, I have looked into joining the Miami family through online research and campus visits. I honestly loved the campus, student life, and constant ways of getting involved on the campus as a student. Not only this, but as a public Ivy League school, it has been rated one of the best schools in Ohio."
Freshman,5,The school is very beautiful and has a ton of scenery to take in. It also seems like the local area around the school is lively and bustling. Almost like a mini city. It just has a very good vibe.
Niche User,5,"Professors are willing to help potential students with their future plans. I have gone on various college visits here to see if it it the right fit for me and I have never been disappointed. As a music student, I found it extremely helpful that the violin professor was willing to give me tips on my audition."
Sophomore,5,"My experience in Miami University is pretty good. There are many wonderful teachers trying to teach the students not only for passing exams but mastering each knowledge points. The campus is gorgeous which stores buildings two hundred years ago(Miami University was built on 1809). And there is a town nearby, for those students who get tired of eating in canteen, you can find a restaurant. You cannot miss the ice hockey court when you in Miami, because it has a famous team throughout American University."
Freshman,5,I love Miami. It’s homey and clean and offers a great environment to everyone. I came with some friends but I’ve also made best friends. The teachers look out for you and it’s so personal. I had a teacher asking me about homework for another class because he cared enough to remember.
Sophomore,5,"I love everything about Miami University. The campus is beautiful, the professors are all very hands on, and I believe it to be very safe. Everyone is so friendly and it's not hard to be invited to a party. Miami University is very well known for its hockey team. Every other sport isn't as good though. There are a lot of caucasian students, but they are trying to bring in as many diverse students as possible. Overall, I really love here and I think everyone else would too."
Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing, and genuinely want to see you succeed. There are plenty of ways to get involved, and make lasting relationships. The campus is also gorgeous along with Oxford as a whole."
Junior,5,"Great community on a beautiful campus! Greek life is a huge part of culture at the school so if you plan on going there, plan on joining a greek organization."
Sophomore,5,"I've never regretted choosing this university to experience my college years in. The campus is breathtaking, with an unbelievable feeling of being welcomed to this small town after I chose to exert myself into a completely unfamiliar life."
Junior,5,"Miami University is a great school, called an original public Ivy League institution. There are clubs for everyone and the nightlife is good too. The professors care about your success.

It is about 45 minutes away from downtown Cincinnati."
Sophomore,5,"Miami builds relationships with their students. I commute to Miami every day, but Miami still provides opportunities to get involved whether that be at clubs or just stopping in to grab a coffee from Starbucks. The faculty cares about their students and wants each and every student to succeed. I also like the fact that if you are not enthused about going out on Saturdays and drinking and following the ""college years"" stereotype, Miami has so many activities that you can do instead to keep you involved at night and still have fun."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful and Miami provides you with great resources to start your career. One of my favorite things about Miami is our slogan, ""love and honor."" Many truly do take this to heart and try to represent Miami in the best way they can. Miami is really big on Greek life."
Junior,5,Miami is my home away from home; I absolutely love being here. All of the professors are incredibly helpful and care about their students' success. There is always something going on on campus and there is so much to be a part of.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus at Miami University, but the one major thing it is lacking is diversity. It is a fairly expensive school, but all-in-all I am enjoying my time here."
Junior,5,I like how many facility are on the campus and the overall size of it. Coming from a small town I liked how I was able to explore. The professors work with you very well and the homework is not overwhelming if you manage your time well
Junior,5,I’ve loved my time at Miami so much! The professors and classes have been really great. The campus is beautiful and everyone is really nice and fun. Party and Greek life is the best here as well.
Freshman,5,Great campus!   Friendly staff and everyone is very helpful!  Miami was a definite choice and so happy we made this choice.
Niche User,5,"Beautiful Campus, great environment and outstanding community. Great academics, and the sporting events are very fun to watch. Lots of classes are offered and the professors are incredible. Because of the smaller class size, class seems more personal, and with better student, teacher relations."
Sophomore,5,"Miami University is truly an amazing school. Academically, they challenge their students to be the best they can be. They prepare their students for the workforce and the real world. Miami also has a wide variety of clubs. There's something here for everyone! Miami is also a very safe campus. The Oxford Police department does an excellent job of keeping Miami safe. 
One thing I believe Miami should improve on is their scholarships. When I was applying for other schools, I was receiving very generous scholarships left and right. However, I did not receive anything from Miami. However, in general, Miami is a fabulous school. It really feels like a home to me."
Freshman,5,"Only been here for 2 weeks but I love the campus, the town, the professors, the parties, the environment, the people. Has a lot of bad stereotypes of being a white, preppy, party school but there's lots of different people here and different ways to get involved just like any other kind of college experience. Love it here."
Sophomore,5,"Miami University is a great place to party, have fun, and work hard. It's a prestigious school with class, elegance, and character. The student life is very wide ranging to suit a variety of people. The cost of attendance is outrageous but that is a problem at a higher level than the university itself."
Freshman,5,"Miami's campus is absolutley beautiful and the advisors are always able to help. Throughout the application, acceptance, and orientation process they were they were able to answer every question I had, whether it be through an advisor or a current student."
Junior,5,"I will like about is to study there and just to meet new friend so that way i will never gonna cry for miss them so mentally, This will not affect my life because i wanna do something good to make more polite to me."
Sophomore,5,My process for applying to Miami University was a great experience. The counselors and advisors have been incredibly helpful and made the task of transferring very simple to achieve.
Sophomore,5,I love finding many activities to become involved in and meeting a lot of new people that way. There are also a lot of resources for academics no matter what major.
Niche User,5,"I'm really looking forward to attending Miami. I've heard many great things about the school from its professors and academics to its student organizations and campus life, not to mention the beauty of its campus! It is ranked 3rd best national university for undergraduate teaching by USNews, ahead of Dartmouth, Brown, and Stanford, etc. It is also one of the original eight Public Ivy schools, a group of publicly funded universities considered as providing a quality of education comparable to those of the Ivy League. In addition, the renowned poet Robert Frost called Miami's campus ""The most beautiful campus that ever there was."""
Senior,5,"I absolutely love Miami University with all my heart. It is expensive to attend, especially as an out of state student; however, the education and experience has been worth it. Miami has so many ways to feel involved and a part of the community. There are so many different orgs that it'd be impossible to not find at least one that you'd fit in with. Miami does need to step up its game though with diversity."
Freshman,5,"Miami is a great university. The faculty is fantastic, they always have our best interest in mind. The campus is beautiful and well kept. The uptown also has great restaurants so Oxford is an awesome place to have the college experience."
Freshman,4,"Very beautiful campus with an environment that screams ""work hard, play hard."" As a freshman at this university I love it, would not recommend if you have to pay sticker price though (the girls are beautiful too)."
Freshman,4,"I find that Miami offers a variety of courses online, but not all. The ones that do are very helpful to my education."
Freshman,4,I felt that they have done an okay job with handling the pandemic and their campus is beautiful and the classes are wonderful.
Sophomore,4,My online experience was pretty good considering the professors had very little time to prepare. The professors I had did a very good job of communicating with students even when they didn't have a definite answer to give us. I am hoping the online learning in the fall will be more beneficial since there will have been time to prepare.
Senior,4,Most professors have made a good attempt to ensure the online class experience is close to an in person experience.
Sophomore,4,"I Iove the campus, the academics and the environment. The campus is one of the most beautiful spaces I’ve ever been in my life and is what dreams are made of."
Graduate Student,4,"I loved the ratio of student-to-teacher faculty-- more than just for help in classes; the small to medium class sizes allowed my professors to see me as a bright student and offer me extracurricular research and club leadership roles.
On the other end, the socioeconomic demo of the school caused issues when it came to the social strata. If you were not wealthy and white, you were in danger of facing ridicule."
Graduate Student,4,"Professors were quick-to-act. Webex and Zoom and Google Hangouts never saw such an influx of users before, but the patience my teachers employed with it made all the difference. I was in a very group-work heavy major, so certain allowances (such as team meetings in person) were gone, but the fact that professors made themselves available for office hours at practically any hour made up for the disorienting transition."
Freshman,4,"I love Miami! The professors are great, the online classes are a great option, and the campus is great!"
Senior,4,Online classes are a great way to let you focus on more flexibility but online classes are just as  demanding as face to face courses
Sophomore,4,"Miami University seems to be heaven on Earth for this student! Fortunately for me however, I am a straight white male who has never felt an ounce of oppression in his life besides financial instability which pales in comparison to what many of my ""diverse"" peers have undergone. Miami University greatly needs to increase their actions and voice on matters related to the current state of civil unrest."
Sophomore,4,"The online learning experience was forced upon the students and faculty of Miami University during the Spring of 2020 due to COVID-19. While the quality of education decreased marginally without in person lectures, the university staff worked quickly and tirelessly to mitigate this fall off as much as possible."
Sophomore,4,The online learning change was difficult at first but after some time professors seemed to get the hang of it.
Junior,4,"Online courses are usually set up where you must teach yourself content, for some this works, but for others it does not."
Junior,4,"I love the feel of the campus and the community there. Most of the professors are nice and helpful. One of the issues I have run into is a lack of communication from my academic  advisor, which is not the case with all of them. I want to add a botany major, however the classes are spotty, with few being available at a given time. The staff in the department don't seem to know if or when they can offer some classes, I think due to shortage of professors to teach. The main major I am going for is zoology, but there are few animal-specific courses offered. If you pride yourself in offering botany and zoology degrees specifically, then make sure you actually are able to offer the classes for them! Also Oxford makes intro. chemistry way harder than it needs to be to weed people out.
However, there are also multiple things I love about Miami. The scenery is beautiful, the dining halls are pretty nice, and my korean prof. is absolutely wonderful, so kind and understanding."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy attending Miami and love the feel of the campus. My freshman year was cut short due to the COV-19 however I maintained my grades and still received the great academics.  However, I do feel that Miami is very expensive and do not support the ""middle"" class incomes."
Junior,4,"For starters, the campus is gorgeous. The lush green grass in contrast with the red brick is always a refreshing sight to see.   Garden and Main Street market are two of the best dining halls and if ever you need lunch on your way to class, simply pick up a bite in the Armstrong student center. Emporium sells a variety of sandwiches and ready-made sushi is a student favorite. 

Since Miami University is located in a small college town, the campus life is well developed. Organizations like Miami Activity Program put on late-night events which range from art nights to movie nights, held in the Henry T. Wilks Theater.

The Miami staff also offers many resources and events targeted towards professional development and career-building, which allows for much-needed networking. The Student Success Center located in the basement of Armstrong holds mock interviews and resume reviews. An academically strong school that prioritizes undergraduates."
Junior,4,"Online courses are well developed and organized, but move very fast. If you struggle with time-management it is best to take in-person courses because Professors are not as forgiving. Office hours can be moved around with ease and depending on the course you may learn more online because you can take it to your desired depth. I would recommend taking at least one online course, especially over the summer."
Senior,4,"Miami utilizes the website Canvas in order to keep students and professors connected online. Some teacher use it more than others but teachers are great with keeping their students up to date. As I would expect happened for most students, the remote learning during Covid19 showed that some teachers were more proficient in online resources than others."
Junior,4,"I like the classroom environment, however I dislike some of the professors.  Some professors are slightly rude and don't explain well and aren't willing to help."
Junior,4,"I like the classroom environment, however I dislike some of the professors.  Some professors are slightly rude and don't explain well and aren't willing to help."
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere of the campus and how gorgeous the scenery is.  The people there are all very friendly and respectful.  The classes are also exemplary and I love my teachers.
Senior,4,"The business school has the connections to get you where you want to go. However, the grading of the professors can be over the top to meet department standards. There is a lot of cheating especially with online classes making some students perform better than what they can actually do."
Senior,4,Miami has been the best choice for me! All of the staff is extremely friendly and helpful I have enjoyed all of my time at Miami
Senior,4,Overall all of my professors made the transition so easy!  There was the usual bumps but I was still able to get the most out of my education!
Sophomore,4,"A lot of professors were good about going online with no warning considering that we went from having in-class classes one day and the next day we were online. Some of my professors kept it as normal as possible by keeping the routine but others rarely had class and were hard to manage, really depends on the professor."
Freshman,4,Miami University has a great atmosphere. However the night life can get out of hand. Most of the profs care about you and your future. The food is eh but it could definetly be worse
Sophomore,4,A great university with a massive Alumni network. Located in a small town with Kroger a 30 minute walk away from the farthest point on campus. Great food options uptown and amazing passionate professors. Wide variety of student organizations and things to do on campus other than classes. A big push for students to do study aboard and the university has its own campus in Luxembourg. A large population of international students as well.
Sophomore,4,"I live the education I get at Miami.  However, had I known that I was intending on majoring in political science I probably would have gone to a different school. The professors are great but there are not a lot of poly sci course options"
Niche User,4,"I am a high school senior now committed to Miami University. There are so many programs to pursue, and the campus is amazing! Student life is great too!"
Sophomore,4,Miami University has offered me many things in my two years here. I have always felt safe and accepted. It is easy to find help with any issue you may have when it comes to living on campus or getting help with classes. The staff is friendly and the proffessors are great!
Sophomore,4,"I love the Greek life at Miami University! Also, if it were not for Farmer School of Business I would have gone to a different school. There are a lot of events on campus as well as a variety of different bars to go to Uptown. If you aren't social, don't come here."
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently in my second year at Miami and I've truly enjoyed my experience here. I attend the regional campus and take a few classes at the main campus. The regional campus is really affordable, makes it possible to get a degree while being busy with work/family, and provides a large amount of online courses. Professors are encouraging and push you to think deeper about the course materials; it is obvious that they are passionate."
Freshman,4,"Honestly the level of excellence here is amazing. Overall the school really prides itself on looking good and producing excellence. Life on campus is great and there is plenty to do on and off of campus. Gen ed classes do suck, but classes where you are really interested on the topic are absolutely amazing. I could not be more thrilled to be on a campus where everyone is so proud to go there."
Alum,4,"I think Miami University was the perfect school for me. The size (both overall and individual classes) was great, the academics and opportunities were strong, and the town is quintessentially college."
Freshman,4,"I have loved my experience at Miami so far! I think it’s super important to get involved and there are lots of opportunities to do so. I believe that the diversity on campus is lacking, they need to seek out people from different backgrounds not just different races"
Alum,4,"Great school academically, decent faculty, decent sport teams. Great night life, but a bit preppy student body."
Freshman,4,"I love the faculty and the academic system here so far. I absolutely love the campus. It is big and amazing. What I dislike about Miami is the location and also the food could be better. I also appreciate the diversity in Miami. If only there were more African Americans and Hispanic students, though."
Sophomore,4,"I love the people and the classes. The campus is beautiful. The diversity could be a little more but once you find your community, you really find a home. There are a lot of activities to do and clubs to be a part of. Miami has offered me a lot of good opportunities and I don't doubt that it was the right choice for me."
Freshman,4,"I came from a very urban area, so the first month at Miami was a HUGE transition for me. But I put myself out there and found my people."
Alum,4,Miami is a beautiful campus with great places to walk to.  It has a great business school (that was new when i was there) and a cool campus center.
Freshman,4,"Miami University puts emphasis on getting involved on campus and within the Oxford community. They also offer many resources that allow students to explore volunteer and career options. They offer free help with reumes and put on career fairs. Miami cares about what their students do while they are at the university and what they will do once they leave. Diversity is an issue the university faces, but that won't change immediately because of how expensive the school is and the view outside people have on the school."
Freshman,4,The people here are incredibly nice. The professors want to help you in any way possible. The scenery is beautiful. Amazing school!
Sophomore,4,Miami is a great school on a beautiful campus. I have had many professors who are genuinely concerned for you and want to help. Miami's biggest flaw is the desire for money. It seems like they will get money wherever they can.
Niche User,4,"Miami University offers amazing scholarship opportunities, both through applications and merit-based. The campus is also so beautiful."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful Campus, great staff.  The facilities are very new (for the most part) and the campus has lots of green space."
Senior,4,"A wonderful diverse culture with students from all over the country and all over the world. Considered a public ivy school, Miami University is some of the best education you can attain, while still saving a few bucks. Teachers and student services are top of the line and do their best to cater to each individual student's needs."
Freshman,4,"Campus is beautiful. Wide range of classes and majors. However, the culture surrounding Greek life is toxic and dangerous. Avoid social fraternities at all costs. I do not feel safe walking in frat areas"
Sophomore,4,"The diversity is great. I love attending Miami, my only wish is it was more affordable or had more options for kids with less financial means."
Junior,4,"I haven't gone here long but a lot of people I've met so far are very nice. Also, I like the environment away from city life."
Junior,4,"I like Miami University over Ohio State mainly just because of the location. Miami is located in a nice rural town and walking to classes is very nice, I prefer this much more than living in Columbus."
Niche User,4,"I loved the small town feel that Miami provides. It's a tight knit group of students and have a relaxed atmosphere. 

There is a great deal of focus on Greek life (fraternities and sororities), so it would be beneficial to provide other sources for student activities."
Freshman,4,I loved everything about Miami of Ohio except for the fact that it did not have sorority houses. It had a great vibe.
Senior,4,"I like that there are so many clubs and groups active on campus, and every fall and spring semester there is a Mega Fair so that students can find and join these groups easily. I have witnessed over four years an increase in diversity in the student body, and I hope it continues to increase. The city of Oxford frequently reaches out to Miami University students with events and opportunities to integrate, but it seems that most students tend to ignore the rest of Oxford that isn't campus or the uptown area."
Sophomore,4,Campus is beautiful! Transfer program is very organized. Counselors are great! Will see soon how good professors are but looking forward to a great semester.
Sophomore,4,It is a good school. There are loads of activities for you to participate in. A lot of on-site training and it is exceptional in helping you get your degree in a timely manner.
Alum,4,Miami University was a smaller community which allowed students to grow close to peers and professors.
Junior,4,"Amazing time, I miss it every time I am away, such a great college atmosphere I'm sure ill miss when I eventually have to leave."
Sophomore,4,Miami is very unique in that it provides a quality education similar to that of small private colleges. It focuses on undergraduate teaching and wants to hear from its students on how things can be improved as a whole.
Sophomore,4,"My personal experience at Miami University has been great. I am a student at the Farmer School of Business and the opportunities I have there seem endless. My only concern with Miami is the diversity issue. There is no question that Miami has a diverse body of students, but I have noticed that the number of international students has decreased and  I think I know why. Some of the professors I have had at Miami treat the international students worse than students from the states. This could very well be due to the fact that they are frustrated by the international students possibly not understanding a concept due to an unfamiliar English phrase, but there is still no excuse for belittling a student willing to learn."
Junior,2,"My online experience at Miami University was less satisfying than in-person. The focus seemed to be on deadlines more so than educational outcomes, and the rushed transition to online learning had much lost in the process. I found it difficult to keep up with my assignments more so than when classes were in-person, especially with services such as the library and student center no longer being available."
Niche User,2,Teachers aren't very helpful and the staff at the student services don't know what they are doing. They only care about taking your money
Freshman,2,"Scam, literally in the middle of nowhere and extremely inconvenient for people without cars. There are good professors. If you're not the Business school, you will not be given priority on anything. Also, good luck finding a job if you're in CS as there are only a few companies who come and most are local Ohio based. Campus food and housing is horrendous and the 2 year on campus policy is even worse. Even the campus beauty gets boring after a month as you start to realize there's not much to do other than drink. I would recommend this only if you love living in nature and want to party every night. Can't wait to transfer out of here."
Freshman,2,"I was extremely disappointed by my freshman year at Miami. If a small, conservative town doesn't sound exciting to you, I would highly recommend considering another college. Miami is a party school, and for most weekends consist of only frat parties and going to a local bar. There's just simply nothing else to do. There are a few restaurants uptown, and a small place you can paint ceramic pieces. It gets old really fast. Miami also has a culture that I can't sync with. It's very much like high school - everyone tries so hard to fit into a stereotype that there doesn't seem to be much individuality (although that may just be my own experience). There is hardly any diversity, either. There are many Chinese students, but for the most part the Chinese students tend to group together and stay from interacting with any domestic students. I will say the business school has gained a reputation for a reason. I learned more this semester in business core than I ever could have expected."
Senior,2,"Miami is very expensive. The business school specifically is artificially hard and the professors do not care about their students. The party scene is amazing and I've made so many lifelong friendships here. Parking is always a nightmare. The school finds every opportunity to make you pay ridiculous sums. Miami seems to only care about making money. If it weren't for the friends I've made here, I would have left a long time ago. Greek life is amazing here so college is really only enjoyable if you are involved."
Niche User,2,If you like rich stuck up people who judge you for having pockets on your shorts then this is the place
Sophomore,2,"Saying this as a Spanish major: The Spanish program at Miami is a joke and a waste of credit hours that could be spent taking classes for a useful major. After the fifth semester Spanish class, which is what a student with a 4 or 5 on the AP exam would come in with credit for, most of the classes offered are BS literature classes that do nothing to develop Spanish proficiency. There is a linguistics track offered as an alternative to taking literature classes for the Spanish major/minor, but good luck getting into the Spanish linguistics classes if you're not in the honors program. Even at the 300/400-level, it's very common for professors to frequently use English to clarify things in their lectures because the students often haven't developed sufficient Spanish proficiency if they haven't gotten to study abroad. One would have better luck getting fluent in Spanish from a gap year in South America than from a Spanish major at Miami."
Sophomore,2,"Miami University sits in the middle of nowhere, all there is to do is go to school or get drunk at the bars uptown. Everyone likes to party and go out (during the week) and the alcohol abuse is obvious. It's so boring in Oxford, driving an hour to Cincinnati is your only escape. Dining halls were only open during the week and the walk to uptown was awful, especially if you live on campus. Students at Miami are white upper middle class or Asian international students. There is zero diversity and people tend to be very racist. Coming from an upper middle-class, white family from the midwest, I should've felt comfortable there, but I didn't. People at Miami are very snobby and flat out rude. Greek-life is a joke and solely based on looks and wealth.  Switched schools after Freshman year."
College Junior,2,"It's white as far as the eye can see. Very few black students, about the same amount of Hispanic students, some Internationals, very few Native Americans. I haven't experienced any direct forms of racism, but the ignorance toward minority cultures is abundant."
College Junior,2,"There is alcohol everywhere. It is in every dorm and most dorm rooms. It is incredibly easy to drink underaged and get into bars. As for drugs I don't really know. There's a lot of weed, but not a ton of more hardcore drugs, but I'm sure they're around."
College Senior,2,"Hockey has a huge following, but otherwise you tend to forget there are other varsity sports."
College Junior,2,"I think that there is opportunity for school spirit and student involvement in the varsity sports, but the sub par performance of the teams makes the students less likely to go. The athletic facilities for non-athletes are horrible and need to be greatly improved."
College Senior,2,People care more about fraternity intramurals than the D1 sports
College Sophomore,2,"Miami isn't a school for students looking to tailgate a football game or attend any sort of sporting even really. Upon getting to school i realized quickly that no one (that I knew anyway) cared at all about Miami sports. That said, the gaps in sports-involvement are filled with parties."
College Sophomore,2,We have a lot of sororities and fraternities that get in trouble for hazing
College Senior,2,People keep getting killed and assaulted. All that happens is the President sends out an email and nothing else is done.
College Sophomore,2,"From a non-greek standpoint, the Greeks are always partying and getting into trouble, and it's actually a huge problem on campus. There's a lot of social pressure to go greek."
College Senior,2,"The football team sucks, the basketball teams suck, and I don't like hockey"
College Sophomore,2,"If there's one thing Miami is known for, it's our Greek life. You won't necessarily be looked down upon if you don't pledge, but you're not praised for going against the Greek life status quo. The sororities all live in Central Quad, which is near the southern end of campus. The fraternities don't live on campus, which probably explains why several of them keep getting into trouble. From what I heard, they do throw some pretty awesome parties. One of the good things about Greek life is that heavy emphasis is placed on getting involved in the Oxford community."
College Sophomore,2,Rich Kids = Aderall nation
College Freshman,2,Nobody cares about any sport except for hockey.
College Sophomore,2,Not all sports have the best team out there
College Sophomore,2,"Nice school, robotic people, useless classes"
College Freshman,2,Buildings are old and not well maintained or cleaned
College Freshman,2,Greek life can be good but there is hazing and drug/alcohol abuse
College Freshman,2,Our sports teams aren't great and no one goes unless its hockey
College Sophomore,2,"The OEEEO has not been very helpful for me, personally. I was being sexually harassed by my boss and reached out to the OEEEO for guidance. They ignored my emails. The second time I reached out, they would take weeks to get back to me, and weeks between every interaction. When I finally got access to them, things went smoothy. But they could have prevented so much of the sexual harassment, had they actually responded to me the first time. I am incredibly disappointed in them for failing to ever respond to me at all the first time I reached out."
College Sophomore,2,"I havn't had a good time at Miami. But this is because I live off campus. Other people seem to like it, but there's a lot of drinking and not really much else to do."
College Sophomore,2,Our dorm room is very small - the smallest in the building with no walking room. There is absolutely no sense of community and nobody wants to be friends unless you will party together.
College Sophomore,2,"Sometimes it seems like everyone here is a stuck-up white rich kid. We have a lot of very rich Chinese students, but for the most part they don't speak english and they seem very cut off from the school, all in their own communities."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is centered at this campus. It sucks
College Freshman,2,"A lot of students choose to use drugs, ESPECIALLY ALCOHOL. Almost every student goes out almost every weekend."
College Freshman,2,"I live in a tiny room and sleep in a bunk bed. I can hardly fit my clothes in my closet and share an often dirty bathroom with my floor. The drinking fountain on my floor has been broken all semester. My kitchen is in the basement (I'm on 3rd floor) and is shared by the hundreds of residents in my hall. We aren't allowed most kitchen appliances (I.e toaster), and our mini fridges don't have enough freezer space for frozen foods (microwave meals). That being said, it's expensive."
College Freshman,2,The nightlife was a blast the first semester. It's already gotten old by the second. School itself is about $6000 more expensive than its estimated yearly costs due to hidden fees. Solid engineering program with a difficult work load. Can be very competitive getting into the class you want/need.
College Freshman,2,"We have no black people. TONS of asians, though. It's kind of sad."
College Freshman,2,To be honest Miami doesn't seem proud of their sports teams partly because we don't succeed in many of them except hockey.
College Sophomore,2,"The gym is over crowded and hard to use during a large chunk of the day. The facilities aren't bad, but when compared to other schools I have been to it needs work."
College Junior,2,"Besides hockey, very little of the student body attend any sporting event."
College Senior,2,I'm not involved and have no interest in Greek life
Recent Alumnus,2,We definitely need more security. I never see security guards.
Recent Alumnus,2,The value is almost irrelevant - no one cares about a degree anymore; the most relevant thing you can do to obtain a job after graduation is to somehow manage to work as you study. I worked three jobs while in school and still find myself struggling at interviews to present myself as a valid candidate for different positions.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I owe a lot to my professors - they're absolutely wonderful. Just not $100,000 of debt wonderful."
Recent Alumnus,2,The only decent team that we have is the hockey team. There's literally no student involvement or fan support anywhere else.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Miami University is entirely too expensive of a school to attend for the education you end up receiving - many students I know have taken out a conglomeration of different loans for the school only to find themselves barely getting by. It's ridiculous. Miami, you're not an Ivy League. Your leadership is defective at best, and you're far too wealthy to be spending your funds on additional rec centers instead of scholarships."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of the kids here didn't have a ton of experience in terms of social life in high school, so when they come to Miami they go nuts. Greek life is huge here, which is almost impairing at times even if you are involved in it. Greek Recruitment tends to be pretty shallow and based on looks instead of communal personality which I found disappointing. They say we have a student to faculty ratio of 21:1, but classes tend to be so large that it's hard to develop any personal relationship with your teachers. Make sure you are prepared for extremely packed parties and a bar focused night life as opposed to a more social, networking drinking experience. The boys here aren't very nice or courteous, and tend to be the typical Frat boy."
College Freshman,2,All of the houses off campus are extremely overpriced and run down. Apartments are a lot more reasonably priced but are further away from campus.
College Student,2,"Good, if one likes to party.  A nuisance if one doesn't."
College Freshman,2,Was told my parents made too much money to receive money. But my Dad had been unemployed until a little more than halfway through my senior year and still only has a part time job. So I find it ridiculous!
College Freshman,2,"I like Oxford, and there are things to do, but it gets old fast. Plus, Oxford is painfully inaccessible. It is far away from most everything. The problem with living in a college town like Oxford (at least for me) has been that there is no escape from Miami, everything revolves around Miami, even off-campus. It's a nice town, and there is a lot to do, but it gets old fast."
College Freshman,2,I'm worried about finding an internship for my major. They have not been very helpful or given a lot of instructions on finding a proper internship for my major.
College Freshman,2,"I personally feel safe when I walk around at night, but that's not the case for a lot of people. Sexual assault is frequent and underreported. Alcohol is rampant and causes a lot of problems on campus."
College Freshman,2,"I initially recieved a small scholarship. But they knew I was out of state, just had to sell our house, and they gave me shit. My mom argued for hours on the phone, sending letters, complaints, and finally got me SOME money, still no work study. absolutely ridiculous--but not entirely Miami's fault. Its just financial aid in general."
College Freshman,2,"The food itself, is actually pretty good. The only problem is, many places have weird hours and are overpriced. This is easily remedied however, because Uptown is within walking distance and offers better food, usually for less too."
College Freshman,2,They say they are generous with scholarships but the guidelines are so strict and specific. The people in the financial aid office were helpful with loans however.
College Student,2,It seems that students receive so many emails regarding some type of sexual assault/robbery on or around campus.
College Student,2,I know little information about the athletics here at Miami.
College Student,2,I did not receive any aid until late October.
College Junior,2,"Outside of hockey, there is little interest in sports or passion for them."
College Junior,2,"There are ways for non-Greeks to find their own group at Miami, but Greek life is a major contributor to the culture there."
College Freshman,2,"White bread everywhere. The occasional group of international students, but Miami seems very segregated."
Sophomore,1,"IF YOU ARE BLACK, maybe reconsider. This school was not made for the minority at all. They don't care about the minority here and will only show some support as a facade for the public. Bunch of rich, snobby kids who think they're better than everyone. Within two weeks of coming back on campus, there were white supremacist signs all over campus and people will call you the n word to your face. Only good thing I could say about this campus is that it is beautiful. Just be very careful and cautious when making this campus your final destination. Love and honor."
Niche User,1,"As parents, allowing our student to attend here was one of the worst decisions we have ever made. It is just an extremely expensive prep school with over burdened administration, red tape, and draconian policies that are over the top.  They do not live up to the hype that they promote on your site visit. None of the programs that our student was eligible for were what they promised. The teaching was horrible! Extremely unorganized and chaotic. Unless you are from Ohio, with subsidized tuition, stay away."
Freshman,1,Miami University claims to care about your future and want to better you as a student but the truth is all they want is your money. They don't care about you individually and if you slip up once they live for that and want rip you for every penny you have. There good Samaritan policy is a joke and never actually useable. There is no chance of you having a social life if you don't party and that is a pretty broad consensus. I highly recommend looking at a different school. I am transferring as soon as possible. If they cared more about helping people experiencing sexual abuse or those using illicit drugs than just prowling  trying to bust kids who drink. I am counting down that days until I can leave.
Niche User,1,"Don't go here unless you wanna be suspended for a semester after three strikes. These include owning any type of smoking glass, being around anyone who is drinking, or smoking a cigarette/juuling. If you join greek life the odds of being caught are smaller, but dorm life is hell. This school is ridiculous in its policies and gives students no freedom, even though they are legal adults. DO NOT GO HERE. SAVE YOURSELF."
Freshman,1,"Imagine if a college admitted every douche bag you knew in high school... That is literally Miami University down to the ""T.""  If you do not look or act the way people expect you to, then you will have hard time finding friends.  This especially true with trying to rush.  Even if you want to be Greek, its impossible if don't either know people before rushing or if you are not like them.  Learned this after a semester at Miami and I left because I knew I deserved better.  And you do too."
College Senior,1,Teams are terrible and too much money is dumped into losing teams
College Senior,1,there are a lot of parties but people keep getting sexually assaulted.
College Senior,1,Registering for classes is the worst thing imaginable. Get ready to get screwed.
College Senior,1,People do drugs and are basically allowed to.
College Senior,1,We have the most fraternities the sororities getting kicked off campus in the country. So many terrible things happen in these organizations and the campus would be better off without them.
College Senior,1,Our teams are bad and no one cares. People would rather go drink on a saturday afternoon than go to the football game to watch us lose 63-0.
College Freshman,1,Seen or heard of people doing cocaine and smoking marijuana. Plus theres places to drink every day of the week. A definite textbook party school.
College Sophomore,1,The girls and guys think that they are so much better than anyone who is not in Greek life. Hazing is very much alive and well.
College Senior,1,I'm not a big fan of the Greek life here.
Recent Alumnus,1,The dorms are entirely too small for how expensive housing is! It's ridiculous.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Our Greek life is infected with students who are far too spoiled for their own good; coming from a diverse city like Chicago, it was an absolute culture shock for me to observe an entire campus of students dressing, talking, and acting the exact same way as everyone on 90210. They don't prioritize their education over partying, but then again, their parents are able to pay entirely for their education with no repercussions so why would they?"
College Freshman,1,The financial aid office was unhelpful and even gave me wrong information over the phone. This wrong information led to dropping a class that in turn cost me over 1000 dollars and the Financial Aide office offered no recompense. I paid out of pocket for their mistake.
College Junior,1,Miami university is nothing but a party campus. I believe some students go there for the parties instead of getting a college degree!
College Freshman,1,"I do not care much for the Greek life on campus. Many fraternities are the causes of the sexual assaults and other problems on campus. They have a superior attitude and look at non-Greeks as outsiders. If Greek life is your thing, then this is probably the best school in Ohio for you to attend. If you want nothing to do with it, this school and its Greek-oriented culture will just anger you, as it did for me. I do my best just to ignore it, but it's very prevalent and while there are certainly nice people in Greek life it seems to me the obnoxious ones take over."
College Freshman,1,most people receive little to no money
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is a huge deal- basically everyone does it.
College Sophomore,1,Not diverse at all. Everyone is white
College Sophomore,1,I had a terrible roommate experience and the housing staff did not fulfill their promised plans. It was a horrible experience.
College Sophomore,1,I applied for financial aid multiple times and did not receive it. I am still dealing with it and I am done with my first year
College Sophomore,1,I hate hate hate Ohio weather. Especially winter. Its cold and depressing.
College Sophomore,1,"The food on campus is absolutely HORRIBLE! it shocks me how during orientation they glorified the vast food choices they created for their students when in reality the food is the same every day, there is no variety and furthermore the food is usually very oily and lacking nutritional value. I have also witnessed some of my friends who are gluten-free have a hard time finding meals that fit their dietary needs."
College Sophomore,1,"I feel that as a student who not only adds to the diversity pile of the campus through my ethnicity and birthplace/cultural contributions, i believe that my financial aid package should have not only reflected these sentiments but furthermore been a considerable amount being that I am also a student who displays great merit. I feel as though the school does not care to give you financial assistance unless you individually are paying your way through to college. Because of this there is obviously a gender, race, and cultural gap in the universities population."
College Freshman,1,"If you're not Greek, get ready to lose your social life. I rushed and didn't end up getting into a sorority for some reason and it was devastating. I'm a cute girl and very nice and smart, it was just that there was a HUGE number of girls rushing and I couldn't believe how many amazing and gorgeous people had to drop. Expect Bama-like intensity and don't underestimate the seriousness."
College Sophomore,1,They continue to change the bussing system and its hard to follow.
College Freshman,1,"People are relatively accepting of everyone, yet we have minimal diversity."
College Freshman,1,"Everyone here is White, Christian, and upper-middle-class."
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do anywhere except get drunk.
College Freshman,1,There is probably not a single person on this campus that has not taken part in some kind of underage or illegal activity.
College Freshman,1,"No one cares about anything you do here.  People rarely get in trouble for substances or alcohol, and you can do pretty much anything you want in your dorm without anyone caring.  The only thing this campus is strict about is parking - you will go broke paying parking tickets."
College Freshman,1,It would be very hard to be a minority here. Students not accepting of differences
College Freshman,1,I barely received any financial aid from the school when I did very well academically in high school.
College Senior,1,"In the simplest terms, Miami University is a partying school. Unfortunately, students have very easy access to procure alcohol. The drug/alcohol scene is arguably the school's ugliest aspect. The harsh reality is that a large percentage of students are here for ""the college experience"" (aka drinking and partying). "
College Senior,1,"The Miami and Oxford Police are the worst - they catch you right away, no questions."
College Sophomore,1,Too difficult to get into the Business School.
College Sophomore,1,Sorority girls are stuck up. Fraternity guys are typical. Both Greek groups drink and party too much.
College Sophomore,1,I would go to Ohio State. Miami is too expensive and the people are not too welcoming.
College Sophomore,1,Not too many minorities or diversity.
College Sophomore,1,Tickets and fines are outrageous.
College Sophomore,1,They all dress and act the same. Unfriendly.
College Sophomore,1,The school needs to crack down on underage drinking especially at the nightclubs uptown.
College Freshman,1,Most people are white and come from very affluent areas.
College Freshman,1,"In my time at Miami, ""parking"" has become my least favorite word in the dictionary. Seriously, it sucks. "
College Junior,1,in ohio the weather does what ever it feels like that day if its snowing one day it could be sunny with no clouds the next you must prepare for everything
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is a nightmare. Fridays are great though because a lot of students take their classes monday thru thursday. Fees for permits are high. If you have to drive make sure you arrive at least 30 - 40 minutes before your class so you can find a space.
College Junior,1,Parking services are pretty much the most awful people on the planet. They show no mercy and the tickets are expensive. Driving to campus is not necessary since you can walk and use buses and I do not recommend driving.
College Junior,1,"Although Miami University is an amazing school filled with determined and driven students, the drug and alcohol use is out of control. Coming from a person who does not partake in any of those activities I have found it a little hard to not feel out of place. Everywhere I seem to go on campus on the weekends, I seem to run  into issues concerning alcohol and drug use. The bar lines are constantly out the doors, along with young Freshman girls getting taken away on stretchers. It has made me sad to feel that I don't fit in due to the partying at Miami. You just have to stay focused and not let those types of distractions get in the way of why you are there."
College Student,1,"Miami is fairly strict about their rules.  Also, since it is in a small town, we have both city cops and campus cops, and there are tons of them.  Underage drinking is really hard to do, especially if you live in the dorms.  If you get caught, there are really heavy fines, and twice could mean getting kicked out of the University.  Despite all this, people do it all the time and don't get caught. So just don't be an idiot, and you should be fine!"
College Junior,1,The parking is AWFUL! I love Miami but if I could change one thing it would be the parking. They have so many restrictions on where to park and it can get pretty expensive. Especially if you are at a meter for like 30 seconds extra because the parking patrol has no sympathy when it comes to that and they can hit you with a pretty expensive ticket. My suggestion is walk when you can and only drive if it's absolutely necessary--or take the Miami Metro!
College Senior,1,"I love Oxford and I love my school but oh my goodness, do not even try to park in the vicinity of campus. I recommend walking or using the buses to get around. There are two lots that students can use ""on campus"" both of which are about 15-20 minute walk from classes, and the yearly cost of the permit to park there is quite high, like $100 I think, given that it is so inconvenient. Also, the parking cops around town are ridiculous and you can pretty much guarantee that if your meter expired 5 minutes ago you'll have a ticket, that is if you could even find a metered parking spot. Just make sure you know how to parallel park because every spot in oxford requires that skill. Finally, if you ever get an on-campus ticket, as opposed to just a $10 meter-expired ticket, you'll be paying $75! That is one of the most expensive on-campus tickets in the country, and they enforce the rules! So yeah, parking is not so good, but I still love my university!"
College Sophomore,1,"I see the same groups of black people every day. There are a lot of asians, but mainly whites."
College Junior,1,"The police force is fairly small but they do a good job. However, as far as on campus concerns go, I never saw too much enforcement of the stated ""rules"" while I was living in the dorms on campus. According to these rules,  underage drinking was prohibited and possessing alcohol in your room, regardless of your age was also against the rules. And yet I can think of countless times where these two things and drug use were going on and the RA's knew about them and did nothing. I even had one RA who would actively drink with her underage residents. Rules regarding quiet hours were also poorly followed."
College Sophomore,1,The computers are very slow and they charge to print.
College Junior,1,"Parking is notoriously bad. People regularly get tickets and it is very hard to find a convenient spot during the day. Fortunately, though, our campus is incredibly pedestrian-friendly, so most students walk."
College Sophomore,1,I think the statistic is that 90% of students on this campus are white. The rest are majority Asian on a study abroad program. There is very little ethnic diversity
College Sophomore,1,I mean come on we are adults. No one wants to be controlled all the time with stupid rules. Some rules however very necessary and make sense

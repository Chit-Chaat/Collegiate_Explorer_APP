Sophomore,5,"The professors are very understanding and helpful through the online experience not only due to the coronavirus but taking online classes instead of in class. If you are struggling in a class, they offer zoom meetings and are available through email."
Sophomore,5,When I have taken online classes I have been very pleased. They use Canvas as their online learning resource and it is quite easy to navigate.
Sophomore,5,I've completed one year at the Portland-Metro campus and it was great. Class sizes were small and professors were flexible and knowledgeable.
Junior,5,"I haven’t been there that long, but I really like it. They are really concerned about the students, and try their best to make your learning experience worth it."
Freshman,5,"Overall an amazing place to be. Very easy access to town, good real-world potential, and very hands-on learning as was described."
Sophomore,5,"I have been screwed over by my advisor on multiple occasions, but other than that it is a great university."
Niche User,5,i like all the programs they have and people that are there true i still don go there and how i know about the programs i do research and i ask my teachers about it to get more and more information and they do have good scien computer programs that could be helpful for you.
Freshman,5,"A small community with excellent staff, however, the school could add a little more diverse aspect to it."
Freshman,5,"Oregon Tech has a beautiful campus, great staff, and a wide variety of offered majors. The classroom sizes vary from small to large, but despite the size you still get a personable learning experience. Oregon Tech has been nothing but incredible."
Freshman,5,OIT is amazing! I have never felt more comfortable going to a new school and felt included as soon as I arrived.
Freshman,5,"I love Oregon Tech! As soon as I stepped foot on campus I automatically knew this place was right for me. The staff and students are caring and always willing to help! The dorm life here is fantastic. Everything is kept clean and organized and if there’s ever a bad roommate situation the staff is on it! It’s very easy to talk to other students. Upperclassmen are always willing to give tips and tricks on how to survive college. The professors are straightforward about what is due. The class sizes are perfect. Not too big and not too small. Overall I’m having a great time at Oregon Tech, I recommend it to any students wanting to go into a Pre-Medical Imaging degree or engineering degree."
Niche User,5,I visited the Klamath Falls campus for Oregon Institute of Technology and absolutely loved it. The views were gorgeous and the students were kind and were happy to answer my questions about their wonderful school. It was also very new and fresh and the laboratories were sparkling clean. I also loved how small it was and how class sizes were even smaller than some of my high school classes. Oregon Institute Technology would be a great school to attend.
Freshman,5,"This is my first term at OIT, and there are so many great things this school offers. The school grounds are gorgeous, the professors are so kind and understanding. Everyone is so friendly, and there are so many programs to choose from."
Freshman,5,"I like the intimate class sizes. The teachers are great, and very helpful. Something I would like to see change is the lack of parking."
Alum,5,"Oregon Tech is a fantastic school specializing in science, technology, engineering, and medicine. Its medical imaging program is one of the best in the country. I meet coworkers in the medical field who have graduated from OIT and they all have high standard of quality. The engineering and computer science majors are also top notch. Nearly everyone I know who graduated from Oregon Tech is working in their respective field.

Klamath Falls is a small town and it's definitely not a party college/town. Sometimes you'll hate that reality as a student, but you wont regret having more focused classmates and retaining more of your education. The ROI is excellent.

I always felt safe on campus. 

Things are constantly improving at OIT and their commitment to renewable energy can be seen everywhere."
Sophomore,5,This school is great for more one on one learning. The classes are smaller leaving more time for your questions to get answered. The professors are amazing and the students are kind.
Junior,5,Great place to go even if you don't know anyone in the beginning.  Financial Aid office is great at helping kids along and getting them ready to attend.
Junior,5,Very nice campus along with the professors and other students.  The location of the campus is nice and close to restaurants and other food places.
Junior,5,"Very nice school, located in Wilsonville so it's accessible from almost everywhere. I'd like to see more in person classes as opposed to online."
Freshman,5,"Friendly, warm environment that is genuinely dedicated to helping you succeed in life and strive to accomplish your goals."
Freshman,5,"All hands on learning, with a tight knit community. They host events like having tv or game marathons, and they even went to a showing of Black Panther in a group."
Senior,5,I have attended 2 other colleges and OIT by far cares at the most about their students. OIT has a very high return on investments and they do a great job at helping students to get jobs after they have graduated.
Junior,5,I love this college. It is smaller and lesser known. Mainly focused on offering medical and engineering degrees. The faculty is fantastic. The classes are small and provide lots of hands-on learning opportunities. They have great job placement and ROI records for the medical imaging programs.
Alum,5,The teachers care about their students and there are many ways to find and be part of the community there.
Freshman,5,"Relatively small class sizes, making it easier to get your questions answered. Really passionate, smart people."
Junior,5,"I attend the Wilsonville campus. 

Overall, the building is large and kept quite clean. The staff and students who attend here are extremely friendly and helpful. I'd definitely recommend this school to anyone!"
Sophomore,5,"The Oregon Institute of Technology is a 4 year university settled in Klamath Falls, Oregon. The programs and degrees offered at this university are like no other. Staff go above and beyond to push students to be their best and to achieve more than they think is possible. When things get difficult, staff encourage students to use their many available, on campus resources. As well as academics, OIT has an amazing campus life. The student body is small overall, but almost every student is involved in one way or another. Overall, OIT is a college that genuinely cares about the success and well being of their students, while making college a lasting, positive experience."
Freshman,5,I'm excited to start my brand new career in the Sleep Technology field with the guidance and support of the Oregon Institute of Technology staff.
Niche User,5,"I liked the small class sizes. Every class that I took at OIT, had less than thirty people in them. This made it very personable and easy to seek help and advice from the professor for a specific class. I also liked the hands on opportunities that they offer to the students and field training that they provide for some of their programs. Overall it is a great school that I would recommend to anyone looking to further their education in a great environment."
Freshman,5,"Oregon Tech is a school where students can be themselves and are encouraged to do fun activities such as hiking, skiing,  and even camping during the weekend. When I visited the campus, it was somewhat close to finals and almost no one was walking around instead they would be sitting almost anywhere and studying their hardest which I look for in schools. Students have their own lives but when it comes to business that is when everyone focused. What I would change is probably the housing options, do more than just single or double rooms, probably do a triple room as well."
Niche User,5,I love the campus all the staff is very friendly.  I love how all the staff is really committed to the students and their success
Freshman,5,"Small school, which allows you to get to know your professors and not just be a number. Good size campus which allows you to bet anywhere pretty quick."
Freshman,5,"I have only been at OIT for one quarter but I can say this school is a good fit for me. My classes have been challenging and I have had some good professors. The food is decent, however I reside in an apartment on campus do I usually cook for myself. There is a lot of school spirit and support for the teams. The school has an orientation that allowed us to meet many people before the first day of class and there are a number of clubs and activities to participate in. There are parties every weekend, but they don't seem to get too wild."
Niche User,5,I fell in love with the campus after taking their virtual tour online.  The building and the history that was provided made me feel like I was really there.
Freshman,5,"I love OIT. There is so much to do here and is well worth the tuition money. I would love to see more degrees offered here but its not a big deal because this school is already awesome as it is. The professors are caring and great. Every personal hardship I have had, they have understood."
College Sophomore,5,The experience that I have with the classes at OIT have been excellent. With the classes that I have taken the professors have all been kind and been there if a student needed help with something in the class that they didn't understand. The professors at OIT have been the nicest that I have ever dealt with.
College Sophomore,5,"The safety and security on the OIT campus is very good, I have not heard anything about any serious crime happening on the OIT campus."
College Student,5,"Oregon Tech has phenomenal teaching staff. All professors and assistant professors are willing to help students outside of class time and typical office hours. Professors are energetic, enthusiastic, and helpful. They make it fun to learn, especially in lab-based courses. Most courses, at least in STEM majors, are very hands on. This has been by far the best way to learn and actually acquire new skills.

Class sizes are also relatively small, with most classes ranging from about 16 students to 60 students. Smaller class sizes make it so that professors actually know students and students get to know classmates better."
College Student,5,"Oregon Tech is a great school that provides a lot of hands-on opportunities for students in the STEM programs. I was able to get involved in the school's 2015-2016 concrete canoe team and learn a variety of skills outside of the classroom. As for classes, the professors are very helpful and enthusiastic. I actually look forward to class everyday! The labs provide even more learning opportunity for students as we get to work together in small groups to learn.

I would choose this school again in a heartbeat! The staff at this school really cares about your education and is willing to help in any way. Also, the students are very diverse, accepting, and want to see each other succeed."
College Freshman,5,Oregon tech is nationally known for producing students who are highly competent in their fields as well as well-rounded in their education.
College Senior,5,Very high possibilities of getting a job in my field of study after graduation.
College Student,5,Oregon Tech is exactly how college should be! The student to teacher ratio is applicable and the teachers make the information easy to understand. I am very pleased with my college choice.
College Sophomore,5,70% get jobs after graduation!
College Sophomore,5,I have really enjoyed all my professors.
College Student,5,its a really safe campus
College Student,5,it is a great school
College Sophomore,5,Though I have only completed my first week of orientation I absolutely love the school and teachers! I cannot wait to begin classes.
College Sophomore,5,"Off campus housing is the only option for Oregon Tech Wilsonville.  The town of Wilsonville is a great little suburb.  For those students who like suburban living, this school is an excellent choice."
College Sophomore,5,The administration at Oregon Tech Wilsonville is more lenient than other schools.  The student demographic is overall older and more serious than most schools.
College Sophomore,5,"Getting financial seemed relatively easy.  My tips to all students:  Read up on all you can from the school's website, brochures, etc., and check your email regularly!"
College Sophomore,5,There is no campus food option at Oregon Tech Wilsonville.  Vending machines are great!
College Sophomore,5,I have never actually lived on campus.  There was no 'N/A' option in this section of the survey.
College Freshman,5,My program is the only bachelors degree offered in Oregon. Its the only school where i could go that I get a whole year of hands on experience in the specific field before even stating the job which makes me more professional and ready for my job. I am very excited to be accepted into my program!
College Freshman,5,There are different places where one can study and/or feel comfortable at. Such at the diversity center and the student success center.
College Freshman,5,"So far it is amazing pursuing the career that I dream of, but I am still early in my learning so it is hard to say how great it is overall."
College Senior,5,I am doing what I really wanted to do
College Senior,5,I love my degree and I would do it again if I had to.
College Student,5,"Safety and security on campus is the best I've seen yet. I reviewed our past incident reports from past years concerning safety incidents. The school has consistently reduced the campus crime rates in all categories in the past 5-8 years through policy and procedure changes as well as increasing the number of safety personnel and student awareness. I feel very safe on campus due to the friendliness and awareness of students, well-lit pathways and knowing that students have been made aware of the bystander effect and how to stop or prevent it. All staff and safety personnel are very approachable and personable. If you bring up an issue or concern, they will check it out right then or at their earliest convenience and they mean it. We have emergency buttons conveniently located on campus and safety education is a top priority. I enjoy feeling safe on my campus even at night when I am alone. 

At my last college I was afraid to walk a few hundred feet to my car at night without a security escort or carrying mace on me and I felt scared for my life at times. No incidents happened but security personnel were not there when you needed them, paths and bushes were poorly lit, and the crime rate steadily climbed through the years in most categories and I can understand why."
College Sophomore,5,The process to get into the Accounting program is very easy. There are no applications or special tests. All you have to do is pass the required classes.
College Sophomore,5,My major is Accounting I love the program! The teachers make the subject very interesting and fun to learn about. I want to continue after college to get my C.P.A. and several of the professors have earned their C.P.A and have real world experience.
Sophomore,4,I like Oregon Institute of Technology because it prepares me for my future. I am going into my second year of college but already feel confident that I will be successful in my work field.
Junior,4,Online classes are great for those who like them. The professors are available and the materials are well explained.
Freshman,4,"I believe I don't have the best representation as I have a difficult time working purely online, as well the current situation of my family life it leads me to believe that some factor is doing this, and I want to blame the online structure of Canvas being used but I think I am just looking for a copout."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the surrounding environment appeases those who love to be outdoors. They have many clubs that expand upon that being cycling, rowing, running and many more. And for those who don't care for the outdoors, they have other clubs like robotics and automotive clubs. they have just about anything to suit any individual who attends."
Freshman,4,"So far everyone has been very helpful. I have been transferring all my courses from different school and finding out how to get financial aid covered and everyone I have contacted with has been quick to answer my questions and get me to the right person if they are unable to give me the correct answer. Now pursuing my bachelors and possibly attending one of their programs, I am excited to see how the rest of the year or years turn out."
Niche User,4,I love the students here. They are so kind and helpful during my transition to college. They share their stories and tips to make entering college easier. They are many faculties and tutoring centers that help me understand my classes better.
Junior,4,"The OIT Wilsonville campus does not have an on campus housing option. Wilsonville is a great little town, but the housing is very expensive. Faculty is great, and the courses set you up for a good future."
Junior,4,Oregon Tech is a beautiful campus that is well maintained. There are plenty of areas to fit any students needs for optimal learning and studying. Almost all professors as committed to each students education and making sure that they are giving their class the best education possible. Overall this is an excellent school to attend and be apart of.
Niche User,4,"I liked easily receiving college credit as a high school student. Although I didn't experience the college as a regular student would, I felt included in the community."
Sophomore,4,Professors all have easy access if you need additional help with class assignments. The campus is beautiful and the work out facilities are amazing with the newest technology. Class size is wonderful none of the classes are too big.
Alum,4,"For the most part the school has very good professors. However, the advising is lacking. I did not receive much guidance as to which path to take or things to avoid."
Senior,4,This school will allow you go far as you push yourself. The resource are available but you will have to actively seek them out. Bridging the gap between a student who asks question to a professional who gives answers.
Senior,4,Very nice campus with professors that are engaged in their classes and want you to succeed.  Off campus housing is cheap and nice.
Freshman,4,"The college and area is very small, which means you have small class sizes. It is very focused, and everyone in your classes can relate to you. The campus is very nice, makes sense, and wasn't too confusing for a new student."
Sophomore,4,"I go to OIT on the Wilsonville campus. I like it a lot, I drive from Portland. I take one class on campus and 3 online. The school is convenient. However, it is hard  at times to get with the academic advisor. I have never met her in person which will be very helpful."
Alum,4,"It's a great college to go to, the town is kinda horrible. But the college is worth the sacrifice of the town, almost 100 percent garanteed a job when you graduate."
Junior,4,"Oregon Institute of technology is a well built college that offers a lot for the students that go there. I would highly recommend it, between the small town feel that the area provides, the general atmosphere, and even all of the clubs they offer, it is a great place to avoid feeling too homesick. The teachers are all extremely helpful and know their materials."
Sophomore,4,The academics are second to none. Would like to see more things offered in the town itself for college students
Sophomore,4,I like that Oregon Institute of Technology is a very hands on school. People there are helpful and nice and theres always fun activities going on. If they where a little better with their budgeting and spending I would have given them full stars.
Senior,4,Great online school. I recommend it to anyone who is looking to learn while working full time. Although some of the workload can be heavy. Be ready to learn.
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience has been pretty good. The classes haven't been as challenging as I expected yet, but that will change soon. The people are friendly. The meal plan is awful. Living on campus is very expensive, but it's a great way to meet people. There have been some issues with the wifi and heating, but nothing too major. I do not regret my choice of college."
Junior,4,The teachers are great and really care about their students. They are available for academic and emotional support. The only problem with OIT is the registrars. Their office is so uncoordinated and lacking in communication. I fear they lose a good deal of students because of their lack in organization.
College Senior,4,I have never been to the campus.  I am an online student.
College Senior,4,The school is a good school.  All of the classes are taught by instructors that seem to care about the students' success.
College Senior,4,Any issues that I have ever had were resolved.  The professors are knowledgeable and supportive.
College Sophomore,4,"The school puts on various safety lectures and seminars that actively help promote person safety. The school also does a very good job of letting the students know what the many safety procedures and evacuation measures are so that each student knows what to do if there is a fire, blackout, active shooter,etc.. The school makes us feel very safe"
College Sophomore,4,The people around us last year weren't so loud and annoying so there wasn't too many problems in that area. The dorm rooms are pretty small for two people but with enough rearranging there is enough space to fit everything. The RA's are really helpful and they don't look for the faults in their residents rather they focus on making personal connections with their residents.
College Sophomore,4,I wouldn't change my college if i could do it again because they have a really practical way of doing prerequisites. Instead of having to take all the prerequisites first then go into the major classes like most colleges. the college i attend (Oregon Institute of Technology)  has you take a few perquisites along with  some of your major classes. That way you don't spend only a few years in your major but rather your whole college experience is spent in your major.
College Sophomore,4,I do not personally live on campus but from what I have been told by residents they like the atmosphere of the housing on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics at OIT are good there is a lot of support for all of the sports that OIT offer. Student involvement is easy and the teams always have a good show of fan support. I think that all the teams get along relatively well but I do not have any first-hand experience as I do not play sports at OIT but a lot of people that I go to school with do, and they all of the aspect of the aspects of team sports at OIT."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the fact that this school has Trio a great program that has helped me immensely with my first year of college. Everyone at Oregon Tech has made it really easy to be a student there. The staff is phenomenal when it comes to helping with whatever problems that arise during your school year. The TOP (Trio) program has been great in getting used to the college environment. The advisors are there to make sure that the participants have or get the things that they need to, to succeed in college. I wouldn't have wanted to attempt my first year of college without this program I highly recommend it to those who are eligible to be in the program that they should sign up and see if they can also be a part of the TOP program."
College Junior,4,I am getting a good education and expierience from attending this school. I also enjoy the people who are in almost all of my classes. We are a small group but we make the most of it and have fun doing it.
College Junior,4,"OIT is a good school. 95%  teachers are very knowledgable there are a few who don't have a clue how to teach a class. But they were adjuncts. However, for my degree (Accounting) the teachers are awesome! And want you to learn and acheive success!"
College Student,4,"There seems to be little to no crime at Oregon Tech. The campus seems relatively quiet in terms of criminal activity. Oregon Tech is very safe and feels like a very tight-knit community. I can walk from class to class and always see a friend or two on my way there. Also, the campus safety officers are very friendly and can be seen roaming the campus throughout the day. They are not intimidation, but they are greatly respected."
College Student,4,"Oregon Tech provides great opportunities to obtain jobs and internships both during school and upon graduation. Our schools website has a section devoted to finding jobs and internships provided through OIT. Also, employers visit campus and recruit typically once a term."
College Freshman,4,There has been no crime (aside from the occasional small stolen item) during this school year. The security is very friendly and make people feel safe.
College Freshman,4,"Most of the professors are very good, professional and helpful. As can be expected, there are a few bad apples, but that is unavoidable. However, in most cases, professors are more then happy to answer questions, have students come in during office hours, and even help students after hours. Over all, I have had a great experience."
College Freshman,4,"Oregon Tech is a small, highly specialized school that attracts serious students who don't want to just party, but truly want to learn. Most of the teachers are very approachable and easy to talk to, which is very helpful. The students here are dedicated to learning and are very interesting, knowledgeable and supportive people."
College Senior,4,There are several security measures in place to prevent sexual assaults
College Senior,4,Those I spoke with seemed very sincere about helping me.
College Senior,4,There are a few car break-ins but thats about it.
College Senior,4,I had a very pleasant experience when I went to OIT to get signed up. The staff were very friendly and helpful!
College Student,4,"For being a small technical school, the athletics are more than just a game; it is a community. Though we don't take pride in a football team, we achieve many goals and medals through basketball. Our Hooties mean the world for Klamath Falls and any visiting team can see that."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't know many of those details, it rarely happens."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I enjoy my school."
College Student,4,it has been a great expeiernce so far
College Freshman,4,"My school is personalized and there are lots of friendly, helpful people. The curriculum is challenging but good grades are very attainable."
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't started classes or anything yet, but I've been to the school many times. Each time has been pleasant. The staff has always been happy to help with everything I've asked about, and they've been easy to talk to. I'm not afraid to ask what seems stupid to me, but also very important for my overall academic career."
College Freshman,4,"I have not started yet, this fall will be my first semester. My experience so far is simply touring the campus and talking with a few of the professors. Even with this limited prospective, I can still say I am happy with my choice and look foward to my time at the school."
College Sophomore,4,The off-campus dining at Oregon Tech Wilsonville is best for students with cars.
College Freshman,4,The activities on campus are always fun.
College Freshman,4,"I live in a dorm in Oregon tech. The space of every room is 12x16, where people can choose to have a single room or a double. Only difference with a double room is that you'd have a roommate. There isn't too much space in the room, but it is enough for me to be happy with it. The only thing I really like the rest hall, is for the community around me. It is so easy to make friends and spend time doing anything (if you HAVE time..) I personally am entirely content with this school, and (almost) everything they do. For engineering or medical students, I would recommend this school over OSU or UofO."
College Freshman,4,"Although I haven't pursued an internship yet, I would have hardly any trouble finding one through OIT. They have such a good outreach for major companies and programs."
College Freshman,4,Lots of people to meet everyday and everything is so convenient
College Freshman,4,Its not too much or too little
College Freshman,4,I have eaten off campus a few times and i love getting the great school discounta
College Freshman,4,There are certainly plenty of places to study and hang out with friends. Facilities are clean and well kept.
College Freshman,4,"The whole school is pretty supportive of our athletic teams, especially since we don't have a football team. There are pretty big showings for Volleyball, Basketball, Soccer, Baseball and Softball games. There is definitely good school spirit for our athletic teams."
College Freshman,4,Going to the basketball games are fun.
College Freshman,4,There isn't a lot of crime on campus and security will walk you to your car if you believe it is necessary.
Freshman,2,Oregon Institute of Technology is a much high school feeling college. The campus is very small and most students live off-campus.
College Student,2,There is not a vast amount of Greek life at Oregon Tech. There happens to only be one fraternity and little is ever hard about them.
College Sophomore,2,Oregon Tech Wilsonville is a nerd school.  There isn't a whole lot of partying.  I'm not complaining!
College Freshman,2,"For my first term I had a double room and within the first week wished I had taken a single. The rooms are small and VERY hot because the heaters are ALWAYS on. My hall is very unsociable and I have met hardly any girls. The kitchen is alright, but hardly is ever clean and the oven is two floors below me in the LAUNDRY ROOM. I don't think the prices are reasonable either, and my showers are always luke-warm."
College Freshman,2,"As a vegan who strives to make healthful and wholesome diet decisions, it is very difficult for me to eat off-campus. There are two restaurants at which I can have a variety of foods to choose from, otherwise I always end up getting a salad and potatoes."
College Freshman,2,"The town of Klamath Falls is not very friendly towards the college. There is a high poverty level in many areas of the town, and there is a high population of people who abuse drugs or are homeless. I do not feel safe walking around town past 6 p.m. and always carry mace or a pocket knife for protection."
College Freshman,2,"I don't attend parties because I am intolerant to alcohol, however the parties I have been to are very reminiscent of high school parties. I don't find the party scene to have either a negative or positive impact on the students experiences."
College Freshman,2,The food needs more options and variety. it's pretty nasty unhealthy food. I think my high school cafeteria was better....
College Freshman,2,"There is a public shuttle bus that runs from Tualitan Transit Center to the campus through a business area of Wilsonville, but this shuttle only runs daytime business hours (about 9-4). These hours conflict for many students because a great deal of courses are offered in the evening, some until later at night, and there is no other method of transportation beyond an expensive taxi ride home or carpooling."
College Senior,2,Our school isn't a party school at all
College Sophomore,2,"The bathrooms are dirty and they have grafetti in them.  I'm afraid to go to the bathroom, but in the winter you have to because of the snow."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much of a Greek life at OIT. But the Greek life we do have is active in campus events and do a lot of volunteer work.
College Freshman,2,Very good for tech and health but anything that doesn't fall in those categories are pretty nonexistent. Very lacking in art classes.
College Senior,2,Expensive and not very convenient. Administration takes the best spaces.
College Freshman,2,"Oh, the girls here are fine, don't get me wrong. Plenty of variety, most very friendly. All quite intelligent, though some get a little goofy. Don't even get me started on beauty either. 

You'll just never see them if you are an engineer."
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car, it's a good idea to find someone who does. There is a bus stop right on the edge of campus, but I don't think they come by all that much. Wish there was a grocery store closer. I have only heard of a school shuttle for catching the train or plane for Thanksgiving break."
College Sophomore,2,"Policies are pretty strict in some cases, but will usually turn there heads if its not a big deal.  I would never party on my floor though, because you can get in trouble and I don't want to be on bad terms with my RA."
College Student,2,Most people aside from personal friends dont talk much at all. Not many girls in my program
College Junior,2,"Living off campus is much cheaper than their apartment style dorm living. There are several apartment buildings throughout town at varying prices and locations. I personally enjoy being able to leave campus and not feel like I am living at school. Safety, price, and convenience all vary with location. If you look you can find something that fits you but it wouldn't fall into your lap. The school does not assist with finding off campus housing. But because it is a poor community and a large majority of people that come through are student who want to rent there are many options."
College Junior,2,"Here in Klamath Falls there isn't an abundance of places to go or things to see. Downtown is run down with a majority of buildings vacant and falling apart. Shopping is very limited here, I have heard Klamath falls called a catalog town where you have to do all of your shopping via catalogs. Often people make trips to medford for anything other than groceries. The school is the only positive thing about this town and I feel that locals are passionate about it and its sporting events. To have fun you go to the movies, go the the bowling center, go to a bar, or hangout with friends."
Sophomore,1,"Oregon Tech in all honesty has only made me want to stay because of their excellent professors, academic resources, and size of school. When it comes to the dean and certain other staff, this school falls short. The dean does absolutely nothing to even solve problems. She is very good at sweeping issues under the rug. Having had multiple issues personally with safety, being wrongfully let go from a spot because of my gender, and bringing issues to the attention of the dean that again were brushed away and not cared about, this school is putting on a mask of being way better than they actually are. If you’re looking for a small school with administrative staff that will not care about what you have to say, lie to you, and act like they are being productive while taking your money, then this is the place for you. You can do way better than what Oregon Tech has to offer. Find a better school and go there."
Alum,1,"Hated every minute of this worthless degree. Teacher turnover is ridiculous, class offerings are non-existent. There is good reason they just changed their entrance requirements to have lower standards. Nobody else will come otherwise. They take only the bottom of the barrel students because everyone else has better options. Waste of years of my life. I hate this place with a burning passion."
Works Here,1,"Terrible school. The professors are unprofessional and snobby. They treat students unfairly and will give special circumstances to certain students (their favorites). If you aren't one of the favorites, they will not have your back. They will go completely against you rather than helping you to graduate. They will nit pick you apart and find everything you're doing wrong. They really don't care about you as the student and making you succeed. Its very sad."
Junior,1,"Little to no crime on campus. Best thing they have to offer is the TOP program. Graduation rates are low. Staff is very politically motivated, and uncaring about student wellbeing. The school work is not challenging and quite frankly you can get a better education at a local community college for less money. This is one of these schools that has a reputation that is not backed up, or is severely overstated. Not non- traditional student friendly at all. Very little organization at this institution given the exaggerated reputation. On Klamath Falls Campus"
College Senior,1,I had to give the ratings that I did due to the fact that my school does not have athletics.
College Senior,1,Parking is the worst thing about our college
College Sophomore,1,"I got three tickets the first week of school. They don't allow you to back into a spot ($20 fine), I parked on the line once because it was covered in ice ($50 fine) and my hanger permit was backwards ($20 fine).  The parking permits are pretty cheap, but they get you throughout the year if you do a tiny ting wrong and you are paying as much as a big school.  Also, watch out if you try to park off campus in the witner, the snow plows will bury your car, adn you might get ticketed."
College Sophomore,1,"Hardly hear about these on campus. It's not a big deal if you are in a frat or sorority, and it is not a big deal if you never set foot in one."
College Sophomore,1,"In the union you can play foosball or ping pong, which is boring after 3 days of it.  There are no traditions except basketball games.  The buildings are extremely boring and have no interesting features.  Seems like art is a foreign concept to the design of the campus. Campus Activities is very non-existent, which is hard in the winters when the snow starts to fall and doesn't allow you to get out of town."
College Sophomore,1,"It snows a lot and they don't take care of the roads or parking lots.  The parking lots turns into an ice rink, with cars sliding and people falling.  The streets off campus are just ice for at least three months of the year.  It is hard to leave Klameth falls in the winter because of the snow, and there is nothing to do in town, so it becomes very isolated. Classes are never canceled, so if you are from a warm climate and don't know how to drive on ice, be prepared to buy a bus ticket. Also, ice is everywhere on the sidewalks, two of my friends broke their legs last term when they fell down the many stairs on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"The Dean of Students plays favorites, and there is so much favorite playing that some kids can get away with murder, while others can't pick his/her nose without a lecture."
College Sophomore,1,"OIT is not to blame for the drug safety issues. But, OIT is in Klamath Falls where drugs and alcohol are a way of life for a lot of people around here. Fir example 39 people where just arrested in a massive drug bust. Drugs in Klamath are part of life. However, if you keep yourself to high standards drugs will not be an issue. OIT is mainly campaigning for Stay alive don't drink and drive."
College Senior,1,There is no nightlife. It's difficult to find late night places in the area.
College Senior,1,"The Portland campus library is miniscule. There is one table with a few seats around it and very few books available. Generally books have to be requested and shipped in from Klamath Falls. This means they take days to arrive, sometimes over a week, making it almost useless for timely work."
College Senior,1,"I was VERY upset to find out that accreditation was misrepresented at the school. It is very difficult to find out if a particular degree is not accredited. At the Portland campus, the number of elective courses available per term in the EET program is pitiful. There is a lack of working, modern equipment in the electronics labs; the local community college has substantially better equipment. The technical library on campus is utterly miniscule. Job placement was also misrepresented; the numbers were accurate, but the types of jobs were not as good as the propaganda vouched."
College Freshman,1,"This Is the Short Fall – The financial aid department has some real troubles helping you. I am speaking from a student on a satellite campus that is a few hundred miles from the main campus, so everything has been through email and phone call, and it has not been pleasant whatsoever. There has been no help at all in trying to receive scholarships or grants, this is all do it yourself, and when asking for help you don't get response. Also on multiple occasions I have been told that everything was fine with my financial aid, only to discover later that it was not and I owed the college money."
College Junior,1,"There is only one dance club in the whole town, and it seems to draw underage crowds. Also, due to the lack of an off-campus college residence area many apartments have families next door to students making house parties virtually impossible. Overall, this is not the school to go to if you want any type of nightlife."
College Junior,1,"Campus Activities – There is little to do socially around the campus. Few college hang-outs, and lack of interest from students make the school very beneficial for someone serious about their studies. But difficult for those dreaming of any social life."
College Junior,1,"Over half the students in each class are white males.  I'm in an engineering program and there tend to be fewer women in this field.   There is a mix of Indian, Asian and Arab people making up the extent of the racial diversity I've seen so far."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is the worst for students. That is unless you wake up at the crack of dawn, it is nearly impossible to find a parking spot between the hours of 10am and 1pm. So if you want a parking spot near the school be sure to wake up super early!"

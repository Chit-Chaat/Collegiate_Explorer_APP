Senior,5,Excellent experience at PSC and the Environmental Science programs are the best in this Adirondack location.  I could not have learned this much in a classroom setting. The knowledge gained living at a college that teaches and lets you understand by having first hand experience is by far more that I could have imagined.  Best decision I made to transfer to Paul Smiths College.
Freshman,5,I've been to Paul Smith's college five times with my high school and then on my own visit and at my SOAR meeting I'm going here for aboriculture  and Landscape Management. I have  not chosen any other college.
Sophomore,5,Great teachers and environment. Really enjoyed my freshman year  very excited about learning even more in my sophomore yr.
Alum,5,I love being able to get outside in the Adirondack's! Amazing location near Lake Placid and Whiteface mountain. Professor's are very helpful and guiding. People will go above and beyond to help you because it's a tight knit campus community.
Niche User,5,Paul Smith's College is both a rich place naturally and educationally. They have tremendous facilities and  programs. And don't get me started on those wonderful meals they have.
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful. Paul Smith's also provide a unique learning environment with unique learning opportunities that you just cant get elsewhere. It also has an ample supply of opportunities for student activity or clubs. Safety and Title IX are stressed to be one of the most important rules for attending.
Junior,5,It is a great school and beautiful campus.  All staff are helpful and supportive. The classes are small and you receive individualized attention.  There are many things to do.  Many classes are outdoors and they are many opportunities for outdoor recreational activities.  It is located in the Northern Adirondack Mountains.
Junior,5,Paul Smiths is a beautiful place to learn! There are hands on classes and excellent professors to assist.
Freshman,5,"Paul Smith's is a wonderful place. As I continue to excel in academics; I find it as a result of the excellent support the professors provide. Hands on experience while learning helps students like me, learn more about the topics they study. In addition, the various types of people you meet in a small community like Paul Smith's become lifelong friends."
Junior,5,I would like the PSC community to maintain the traditions and Adirondack feel of the campus. We need to keep forestry and natural science a priority. That is what Apollo would have wanted.
Sophomore,5,"Paul Smithâ€™s College is a dream for anyone who has a strong love for the outdoors. The school nurtures a hands one learning approach, and encourages you to learn outside the classroom. Professors are always available for extra help, or to talk about any concerns you may have. With access to academic success center any student can succeed here, and the school wants nothing more than to see you succeed in what you love doing."
Freshman,5,"Paul Smith's College is a Small Liberal Art's College found within the Adirondack State Park. The college is a hub of natural beauty since it sits right on Lower St. Regis Lake. As an institution of higher learning, the college is an overall great place for one to get their education. The college's various diverse programs from Culinary Arts to Biology the college attracts a wide range of diversely skilled students forming a strong student community."
College Freshman,5,"Although we are located in the middle of a state park, I wouldn't want to go anywhere else to get my degree. The professors know what they are talking about, and the work load is easy to carry if you plan your time out right."
College Freshman,5,"The location of this school is not the only thing that makes this school what it is. The classes and professors are paced well and will keep you on your toes, but on the weekends there is no limit of things to do. Make sure you can find some enjoyment in the outdoors, otherwise you might find it hard to adjust."
College Freshman,5,The registrar is always helping us to make our schedules perfect.
College Freshman,5,The online courses are great. They can be for any subject and any major. They are convenient and fit into your schedule no matter how busy.
College Freshman,5,The career center helps students everyday. They are always working hard to find us jobs and they never stop informing us of all the opportunities we have.
College Freshman,5,The career center has two career fairs every year and brings on all kinds of possible places to work. Internship and study abroad opportunities are the number one emails that we get and the career center always sends out a list of places hiring for our degrees all over the world.
College Freshman,5,"The class sizes are smaller which makes it so much easier to talk and hang out with the professors and really learn the information. All the professors know the names of all the kids in their classes. They really take the time to get to know everyone and they are always willing to meet with the students whenever we need them. Also, go right ahead and call them by their first names. They want to be your friends and help you."
College Freshman,5,"They really focus on your major and what you want to do with your life. All of the ""general education"" classes really aren't that General. They are actually very interesting and they focus exactly on your major. You are never wasting time."
College Freshman,5,"This school is in the Adirondacks. You can't help but feel like you are constantly camping. The dorms are big and nice and always clean. There is so much to do. We have a salt water pool to swim in and Lower St. Regis Lake is literally our backyard becuz it's literally on campus. We can go swimming, hiking, canoeing, kayaking, fishing, and we don't even have to leave the school. All the buildings are rustic and cabin like. I love it here!"
College Freshman,5,Teachers will go above and beyond to help studetns
College Sophomore,5,I really enjoy it here. It's beautiful and just a wonderful place for school. The staff really cares about your learning and growing as an adult.
Recent Alumnus,5,I would do it all again if I could
College Senior,5,cake decorating contests are a blast Make friends
College Freshman,5,"I have had a great time. Many of my highschool friends who also go to college do not like it or have had a bad experience with their college. I got lucky. I love the people who are there, the small, cozy feel the college has, the campus, and my classes (so far). Of course I'd love to have more sports, such as foot ball, but our Woodsmens team is unique and our rugby team is sort of like football. If I had to choose again, I would probably still choose Paul Smiths."
College Freshman,5,My experience at PSC has been the best in my life. It is home away from home
College Freshman,5,The location makes the campus beautiful year round!
College Freshman,5,Paul Smith's College is unlike any other college !
College Freshman,5,It's all about the experience at Paul Smith's College
College Freshman,5,The student body is one large family. Everyone is always nice and has a smile on their faces.
College Freshman,5,The professors are amazing and do a terrific job teaching us
College Freshman,5,The work is very hands on and mimics the real life industry.
College Freshman,5,All of the campus resources are helpful and very useful
College Sophomore,5,"This school is known to be all about the experience. Even during your welcome week at the school, the current student body takes you through the community and hiking trails to gain initial experience in knowledge of the school and community."
College Sophomore,5,The quality of future jobs for myself is incredible. I will be greatly prepared for real life situations and know what type of job I want to go for. Local organizations near the school are also available for volunteer work and education to gain more experience in the field of your choice.
College Sophomore,5,"Each semester there is a career fair and a graduate school FAQ week. For the career fair, tons of potential employers come to the school and meet with students to answer questions and meet future employees/employers. Students dress for success and bring their resumes to help get their foot in the door. The graduate school FAQ week allows constant, all day walk ins to our career center to learn about graduate school and see the benefits. There will be staff there to help you find schools that will compliment your current major and your future career."
College Sophomore,5,"Academics fit each major perfectly. There are mock restaurants for hospitality majors, a real cafe for culinary experience. Our local property including a lake and acres of hiking trails allows for hands on study and field work without the hassle of traveling to gain experience."
College Sophomore,5,Every resource you can think of is available here
College Sophomore,5,"I know that when I graduate with my Bachelor's degree, I will be able to find a job in my field.  This school fits my needs, my career path and all of my professors I interact with daily see the same thing I see."
Junior,4,Beautiful campus and outstanding professors. Administration could do better at listening to the needs of the students but the professors more than make up for it.
Junior,4,"Most professors adapted very well to online classes, those who weren't as comfortable with the technology were able to make it so that at least their students were still learning."
Alum,4,I love the class sizes! The Campus is beautiful! I wished they had a tennis team while I was going there.
Sophomore,4,"Great Community, Great environment. Teachers very knowledgeable. Weather cold but already knew that."
Niche User,4,"Paul Smith's college is very unique due to its location, majors, and overall status. The college is located in the Adirondack Park in upstate New York, which benefits its wide variety of science majors. Because of the college being somewhat 'off the grid' there is not much to do outside of campus, unless you travel to a nearby town. Overall, the college is academically amazing, and inspiring to many people."
Sophomore,4,"My experience here so far has been great. It's a really hands on college, which is how I learn. I am going for an associates from here because I cannot afford the bachelors so I am hoping I get my associates degree from here. My grades weren't the best but the tutoring here has really helped and I am planning to go to more tutoring this upcoming semester. I have made my circle of friends and I am really glad to have them."
Freshman,4,They don't have as many degrees as other schools but if you love the outdoors I'd highly recommend this school. The people are friendly and like family no matter who you are. Everyone is from a differqnt walk of life and if you ever need help everyone is there for you.
Sophomore,4,"I like the small school feel. You really get to know everyone well and make lasting friendships. Most people going to Paul Smiths have similar desires and interests. This makes it easy to find a friend that you can connect with. Location is whar separates this college from most. It is beautiful. Yes, it does get cold, but you are likely the type of person who has been outside enough to cope with the cold if you are going to Paul Smiths. Academically you get to know each of your professors very well. With small class sizes and labs there is a unique hands-on learning experience that other colleges just canâ€™t match. One thing I would change is the food selection. There just isnâ€™t much to choose from and what is prepared isnâ€™t in that great of quality. The library is a great environment to get homework and studying done."
Senior,4,I will be a new coming transfer student at Paul Smiths this Fall and I am beyond excited to finish up my degree at this beautiful campus!
Junior,4,"I love going here. The quality of teachers can vary, but overall I feel that I've learned a lot.  The campus is beautiful, most of the students are very friendly, and I feel it's worth it."
College Freshman,4,Not much experience with career center
College Freshman,4,Job fairs and job listings are sent out all the time
College Freshman,4,Tough professors but they know what they are talking about
College Freshman,4,A lot of work load but very little homework
College Sophomore,4,"Paul Smith's College is the definition on hands on learning. Students here are outside throughout the year, even the cold Adirondack winters dong studies for outside labs. Our relationships with our teachers are very close and they want to help with whatever they can. Any outdoor activity is achievable within a short distance."
College Senior,4,"There area few things I would change about the college. However If given the chance, I would still choose Paul Smiths."
College Freshman,4,"The athletic center, student center and library are nearly always open for student use. There is a good range of student activities, and the campus itself is beautiful, especially during the fall."
College Freshman,4,"My NCCC credits transferred very easily and I was rewarded them all, although most were for electives. For some classes there are different times of the day and different times of the week to take them, which can leave a need opening for another class or a much needed nap."
College Freshman,4,The professors are great. There is a wide variety of classes that can be taken depending on your interests. Class sizes are manageable for the professors and are not too small or too large.
College Freshman,4,The professors are nice and very helpful. The curriculum is not too easy yet is not to hard either. There is hands on experience and opportunities to study abroad.
College Freshman,4,"For my major, which deals with outside lab work not just inside lab work, there are plenty of opportunities to get hands on practice in both. The curriculum is challenging but is made comprehensible to those just starting to learn it."
College Freshman,4,"There are many opportunities, but the biggest would have to be the career fair."
College Sophomore,4,Credits transferred for me very easily. Courses I had taken transferred as electives and core requirements which allows me to graduate on time.
College Sophomore,4,"All professors like to be addressed by their first name. You gain a strong relationship with your professors and some even live on campus which allows you more time to seek help. The class sizes are small and very personable, especially as the difficulty of the course increases."
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are hands on, fun, and educational. You are outside in the field conducting research on animals and their habitats nearby. Our school is also on a lake which allows the students full access to recreation and research for classes"
College Senior,4,"Get your Associate's and transfer as a Junior. Fight for it and add up your credits to double check the planning sheet. This will help you save loads of money and time. Better yet, if you're in High School check out the program you are interested and find a nearby community college that has a transfer agreement with Paul Smith's! This college is worth the immersion in nature if you like hiking etc. but 2 years is more than enough with the extreme cold and cost. Schedule classes yourself and make your adviser simply sign the paperwork so that you don't end up here another semester as some people have. Be motivated enough to get above a 3.0, this school has the right kinds of aid for anyone to do this! Remember that as a small campus some classes are only scheduled once a year (ie Biology I in the fall and Biology II in the Spring) or every other year (ie Wetlands) so plan accordingly! Make sure as a Junior that you are taking any required or desired courses that are only offered every other year so that you can graduate on time or avoid the hassle of finding a suitable substitution. You are sure to find that a minor you are interested in (ie GIS, Chemistry, Biology etc. ) is only a class or two more than you are already required to take, so consider adding a minor! If you are locked out of a course talk to the dean, you can often be squeezed in, have pre-req's dropped (in certain circumstances) or do the course as an independent study if the professor is willing. They were willing to take a UHS research class that my community college would not, so be sure to send all transcripts and apply for work experience credit if you have it! Every bit counts, good luck."
College Senior,4,"Most classes involve at least some face time interaction, but Moodle (kind of like blackboard) is easy to use. The only drawback is some Professors refuse to post grades efficiently or even use the system at all. It is great when they do and post power-points or submission boxes."
College Sophomore,4,"Have not had to transfer any credits.

I've had no problems signing up for the classes I've wanted / needed.  It's been a great experience so far."
College Sophomore,4,"I would most definitely do it all over again.  I've got awesome professors, the location in the Adirondack Mountains is awesome... This school is where I belong.  I love to be outdoors, I love to be able to snowboard on White Face Mountain, we can go skating at the Olympic Park in Lake Placid... if you just step out of your comfort zone and spend time looking around, you'll love this place.  

I think the location is what makes our school unique.  Our campus is part of the ADIRONDACK PARK!"
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are small and the professors know you by name.  I've never had a professor not be available if I needed some extra help or a question answered.  The quality of the courses are great... I walk away from most of my classes feeling like I really am going to do well in my chosen field.  The hands-on experience of field work, the cool things in lab... it's a great way to learn.  Way better than a lecture class of 100 + students!"
College Sophomore,4,"As I get closer to my senior year in college, I've started going to the career fairs the school offers.  There seems to be a high placement rate for PSC students in my field.  I've talked to a few alumni who have degrees in Environmental Science , and a couple of them have found placement in their field immediately upon graduation."
College Sophomore,4,"PSC had exactly the major I wanted - and the classes are pretty interesting that go along with the major.  Registering for my classes was easy, no problems.  The work load is getting a little heavier as I head into my junior year, but I know in the end it will be worth it.  It has to be."
College Sophomore,4,"Our classes and labs are pretty hands-on.  Lots of outside ""field work"" where you have to snow-shoe out, professors and advisors are always available... rate of placement is high for a student from PSC in the Environmental Science world."
College Sophomore,4,"There is always something going on with campus / student activities.  Because PSC is so far away from any towns / cities, they keep us busy with all kinds of things from poker nights to comedians."
College Freshman,4,"Most people wont find us as the usual college, but that's what makes things interesting here! we have a Job fair every semester that helps us find internships and future employment"
College Freshman,4,We have all different people at our school. We have a diversity club here at school which many kids are a part of.
College Freshman,4,I am still adjusting even in my second semester but everything is going extremely well!
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of options on campus for you to choose from when it comes to studying and getting extra help. All teachers are willing to help you if you are having a hard time. If you would prefer though, we do have the tutoring center and separate studies with the teachers assistants."
College Freshman,4,"There is always something going on. We always have activities for people to take part in. Athletics are a tight knit group of people but everyone is friendly. This campus has an ""at home"" feel. Ive never felt so at home, away from home!"
College Sophomore,4,"The people at financial aid have always been very helpful for me, however I've heard that its not always the case for others. I think the tuition itself isn't that steep considering that it is a private school, but the fees for housing and food are definitely overpriced. Luckily, almost everyone who applies here gets a decent scholarship automatically, and they have a lot of scholarship opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,"The career services are great and are very helpful. There is 1 or 2 career fairs every semester, and the people in career services are always having resume workshops and services like that which are great. Also, the online job board always has new postings which makes job hunting convenient. Additionally, many of the professors are great about informing their students about internship opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,There are many connections through this college. There are weekly job announcements that are e-mailed to you. The Paul Smith's name on any degree can get you a great job/career because many employers of these fields either went to PSC themselves or know someone who did and wish they had.
College Junior,4,All basic college students looking for a way to better their career paths.
College Junior,4,About every two months there is a career fair that comes to the school for everyone who's looking for a new job has the ability to find one.
College Senior,4,Lots of applicable knowledge during the 4 years.  Hands-on learning is great!
College Senior,4,Small class sizes - good instructors - hand-on learning.
College Senior,4,Applicable information learned - helpful in internships.
College Senior,4,"Small, involved, hands-on classes and great outdoor recreation opportunities."
College Junior,4,"The library and fitness center are amazing. There seems to be plenty of activities on campus, and all the buildings (except the residence halls) are gorgeous. I like the student center, too."
College Junior,4,"There are plenty of computers in the library, and there is wireless in every building that works very well. You can print for free, too."
College Junior,4,"The instructors are wonderful and helpful and caring, the workload is pretty manageable, the facilities are pretty good, although not top notch. There are many work study opportunities available."
College Junior,4,"From what I've heard, the education is worth the money. I got plenty of financial aid that was really helpful, and some things that I didn't even know about. The financial aid people are very nice and helpful."
Recent Alumnus,4,"most of the core teachers are good, because you have them all four years. it's a small school so if you are going to sleep around everyone knows."
College Freshman,4,most teacher will go out of there way to help you and to make the class interesting
College Freshman,4,The school is close nit and friendly and there are many oppertunities around campus
College Junior,4,"Network is great.  Can access wi-fi anywhere on campus, computer labs are accessable."
College Junior,4,"They were very helpful with this process, easy to get ahold of a live person when we had questions."
College Junior,4,Convenient - Everything is close and easy to access
College Freshman,4,"There are many opportunities for student to get involved. Trips to stores, bowling alleys, churches and many more places.  The academic programs are outstanding.  The programs out you in real life situations and it really helps you with time management."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a hospitality major I take a good amount of business classes as well.  I really have enjoyed the majority of my classes thus far, and my classe are getting to be more interesting."
College Senior,2,"If you are motivated this school is great. Forestry and culinary students have great programs as well. Unfortunately, many science classes are extremely small and the programs are still developing (only about 10 years in to being a four year institution). This can be hard and some classes seem much simpler than they should be. The outdoors is the big draw here, being able to collect wetland data 50 feet outside the classroom is awesome. Hopefully programs will be strengthened here. Until then even classes like Microbiology seem too simple and like the grade is given to you for showing up."
College Senior,2,"This school mainly is white. The ethnically diverse students here are generally pell grant students from NYC that lack the same love of the outdoors as the other students. Everyone is friendly but it is a bit of an odd mash up at first, but after a week everyone mingles well on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The lack of diversity among the student body is probably the worst thing about this school. The campus is predominately white and male. Also, there aren't that many different types of people, or a diversity of interests. Many typical students are very into hunting, fishing, camo and the confederate flag; or there very into weed, tie dye and climbing mountains. Obviously there are groups of people who have other interests, but it's a typical rural school. Unfortunately, the sense of racism and sexism is pretty strong at this school, and some of the students here aren't very open to diversity."
College Student,2,"It does have its highlights such as the campus its self. It had awesome scenery and really is great for the outdoorsmen. However, it gets very lonely up here and there isn't much sense of community from what i can tell. The food is also terrible and makes you feel terribly sick all the time. I would not have chose to go here if i knew it would be like this. There is little going on in and out of the classroom. I could be getting a better education at a community college which is much cheaper. Nice college, but disappointingin many ways."
College Student,2,"Very small class sizes make it so you cant hide in class and you are called on multiple time throughout a class which keeps you focused. However, for some of the basic classes i have found that some professors can be a pain at times. For example some refuse to admit they made a mistake and it resulted in me losing a letter grade."
College Student,2,I was put into a fully online math course and it feels like a big waste of my money and time. I always find myself asking why I am living 5 hours away from home taking this course when i could be doing the same thing at home on my couch.
College Student,2,When i was registering for classes it seemed like my advisor had very little knowledge to what she was doing and it seemed like i was thrown into some classes that had very little to do with my intended major. As a freshman i have a very small work load for the basic classes i am enrolled in now and i don't think it will change much as i get further into my career here.
College Freshman,2,"This school is okay. It is a beautiful campus, and the people there are very nice. But it is extremely isolated so if you are a city person it is not a place for you. Also the school is not very diverse so this is a problem for me. It is a really small school as well. This is a benefit because classes are small and you get more personal attention by professors. But campus safety are assholes. They will come up with any lame excuse to search your room and say they have probable cause. They can go through your things and can confiscate your things. You have almost absolutely no privacy. It is unconstitutional."
College Freshman,2,"Financial Aid rarely answers there phones so it is hard to figure out everything.  It seems difficult to get money, even after applying for scholarships and confronting them for more money opportunities.  The college education is worth the amount of money, but it is hard to focus on classes when you know that your going into so much debt, but i guess this is true for most colleges."
College Junior,2,"Students at Paul Smiths â€“ The majority of my school consists of students from wealthy families whose parents pay the tuition bill. Therefore, many do not take as much of an interest in the classes as they probably should. Politics vary, but I do meet many very liberal students. The school is mostly men, which might account for the large homosexual population on campus. Overall, I see many students as misinformed and naive children who have not yet seen the world for what it really is."
College Freshman,2,Financial Help â€“ All of a sudden I have been told that I need to hand in money on arrival for the next semester and the school has not been helping so far. I have been forced to take out loans from different sources.
College Student,2,I do not like online classes because they confuse me. classes should be handes on.
Niche User,1,"This school needs serious revamping. I transferred for many reasons. The food is terrible, you have no idea what your money gets put to, campus safety ignores the safety and confidentiality of students (as does all of student affairs), a local town is non-existant (Saranac lake is 15 minutes away but thereâ€™s really nothing to do) and the school clearly targets kids who would normally not get accepted into a traditional college. The school takes advantage of itâ€™s students. Itâ€™s really sad to see all the wrong doings being done and you canâ€™t do anything about it. If you try then the school isolates you and puts you in the campus public eye so that you feel alone to the point where you donâ€™t want to return. Reform needs to happen at Paul Smithâ€™s College. If it doesnâ€™t happen soon then I have a feeling that it wonâ€™t be long before the school runs out of money and is shut down."
College Junior,1,"I've been here a week and haven't made any friends yet. I'm super homesick and am ready to quit. The only thing keeping me here is the fact that I live 9 1/2 hours away and my parents want me to try to make it through the semester. People seem to just look right through me. There is some diversity, and they don't discriminate for anything. But there aren't many Christians here. Everyone parties, which is good if that's what you like."
College Sophomore,1,The food is the worst part. You pay 15 bucks each time you enter the dining hall and you get served your own feces. The selection is god awful and whenever they have leftovers they just throw it on pizza the next day.  Its high school food all over again.
College Sophomore,1,"There is a old s****y gym that no one uses, and a decent but small new gym.  The only problem is that they close at 10 and if campus closes because of snow, they just shut down every building on campus so your just left sitting in your dorm/"
College Sophomore,1,No one has anything to do at night other than watching netflix. Around 6 p.m. everyone is using the wireless so it basically doesnt work.  Computer issues are a constant at this school.
College Sophomore,1,"The education I'm getting I could have received from a monkey astronaut. My money was wasted here.  Its like they intentionally raise the tuition so they can ""claim"" they give out a lot of financial aid. You wouldnt need financial aid if the prices were reasonable."
College Junior,1,"When the person came in to the CV-Tec one time, he had said that  i would get credits at Paul Smiths for two classes, one sanatation, and the other nutrition i believe, but i cant seem to get the credits for them."
College Junior,1,"What's With Paul Smiths College? Overall, the only good part about the school that I have seen is the chef instructors and their talent. Yes, I have learned much about culinary arts; but that is about it. I have been lied to, overcharged, and ignored to the point of extreme frustration. The chefs are good, but all of the other faculty need upheaval. I was told that I would, having transferred in, be able to graduate in 4 semesters; somehow that turned into six. Definitely not recommending this school to anyone else."
College Student,1,"Duller Than Flat Black Paint â€“ sure the library is nice, student center is a bit posh with a few pool tables and movie rental. the gym is nice, we have a pool along with a rock wall, but other than that there is nothing to do on this campus unless you want to get drunk or if you have a car you have to drive a long way to get anywhere. you have to find your own fun here, and suffer with cabin fever a lot"

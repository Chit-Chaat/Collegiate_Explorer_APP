Junior,5,"I love Stockton because of the dedicated staff and the ""at home"" feel you get once you walk onto campus. Stockton is my 2nd college, I transferred after my sophomore year.  Comparing the two schools, I feel I have more potential in my academic career. I have assistance from professors, guidance from administration and classmates who all want to thrive together. Stockton is very much a family, and I am very honored to be apart of that family."
Junior,5,"This is my first semester taking online courses through Stockton. So far, I feel the professors have been taking the time to create video tutorials and clips of themselves lecturing, to help with the understanding of the materials. The college I attended prior to Stockton, you were almost on your own to learn the material and keep up with the online courses. Here at Stockton, I feel the professors really go above and beyond to help teach you from a remote location, explaining materials and being very accessible through email and phone calls with any questions that may occur."
Freshman,5,"Stockton University, so far, has provided me with a variety of opportunities to get involved as well as make new friends."
Senior,5,Online classes were very swift and straight to the point. Teachers were easy to reach if you had any questions and were constantly emailing the class. They also give a lot of feed back.
Sophomore,5,Learning at Stockton is really all you could ask for and more. Professors are all there to help you succeed and do everything in their power to help you when it is needed in and out of the classroom.
Sophomore,5,I love going to Stockton. It is a smaller school and the faculty to student ratio is great. All my professors have known who I was and I never scared to ask questions or go get help when I am confused. The advisors that you meet outside of class also guide you on a career path that is very helpful.
Sophomore,5,"Stockton University offers many online classes and many hybrids-classes, which means half of the course is online. I never took any online or hybrid class however the COVID-19 made it possible. All of my classes turned online. I liked the online classes. I learned so many things without going to the campus and all professors tried to help me as much as they could. Some professors were extremely strict and made sure no cheat in any exam. They required to have a camera on during exams and lectures. My professors sent many reminders for assignments, quizzes, and exams. The reminders were helpful. In one of my classes, I struggled in an assignment and I did not know how to do it but the university also had an online tutoring center and the tutors helped through zoom. Therefore, I  did a zoom meeting with a tutor and he helped me in my assignment. I truly enjoyed the online classes and I would recommend everyone take online classes. The online classes are better than regular classes."
Senior,5,Best teachers I have ever had the pleasure to meet. Student body is diverse and huge. They told me exactly how many courses will be accepted and how many will I need to complete there as a transfer students. They also offer instant decision days for incoming transfers.
Senior,5,"I despise online classes. during the COVID outbreak all classes were switched online. Teachers worked incredibly hard to make classes as good as they were in person. Seeing how good they ran it towards the end of last year, I definitely changed my opinion towards online learning and would definitely take more online courses in the future."
Alum,5,"I was used to doing online courses from my Associate's degree, so when I had to complete classes online with Stockton, it wasn't a big deal and I had no difficulty transitioning. The professors made the transition easy and offered assistance if we were struggling."
Alum,5,"The atmosphere of the campus was great. It was welcoming and students were polite and friendly. They had a diverse type of food available for all students including healthy options. The professors really care about their students doing well and are willing to go above and beyond to help. Also, campus police made you feel safe at all times and the area the campus was in was very safe."
Junior,5,"Beautiful campus, helpful teachers that care about their students success. I’m an accounting major, and my teachers made sure I understand every process in order to ensure I pass that cpa"
Freshman,5,"I applied to Stockton based on my major which is criminal justice. I had heard so many good things about the criminal justice program, as well as the opportunities that came with it. Additionally, I had heard that the professors at Stockton were great and I was definitely not disappointed. I feel as though I have expanded my knowledge so much not only in the field of criminal justice but in other fields as well. My professors at Stockton have helped me tremendously in regards to school but also other aspects of my life as well. Since I am a freshman, I have not been exposed to everything that I could potentially do after graduating. Another reason that I chose Stockton was so I could learn more about what I could do with a degree in criminal justice."
Junior,5,I love my school the faculty is extremely helpful I can always have my questions answered at any time and I feel very important. The parking sucks but oh well I don’t care because I’m grateful to be going to a school with such a great hospitality program.
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student at Stockton University, and as of right now, it is a great school. There are tons of ways to get involved on campus."
Niche User,5,Stockton is a great school for every type of person and has great diversity. The professors are nice and helpful.
Senior,5,"when I went to Stockton I had a great experience. With good food, and atmosphere. Everyone was very friendly, and I felt safe there as well."
Senior,5,"Overall I really enjoy the university and its climate is safe and encouraged to learn. Professors are generally good and academically active, Inclusive to most sub groups and friendly."
Junior,5,I really enjoy the campus and people here! The classes are regular college classes (you get good ones and bad ones) but overall it's still a great school!
Sophomore,5,Stockton University is amazing. I took a tour of the school and I can’t wait to attend in January. The school makes me feel so safe and everyone is so hopeful. Stockton University wants to see you succeed.
Senior,5,"I am in my final year at Stockton. So far, it has been great. I transferred to Stockton after spending 1 year at Rowan, and it was the best decision that I ever make."
Niche User,5,Campus was great. Small and loved how everything was in one central location. The buildings were new and clean.  Students seem to love it there.
Niche User,5,I experienced a very home feeling while being on campus. It is close to home but far away from home that I can be on my own. I also think the campus has wonderful staff. Whenever I have any questions someone from Stockton always has the answer.
Niche User,5,I love Stockton University it has been to best college to be looking into. I am looking to go into Stockton University to become a teacher and am looking forward to the best four years of my life.
Freshman,5,I love the campus.  I just started but I am enjoying my time here.  I am happy to be apart of the baseball team.  I am ready to begin my career.
Sophomore,5,"Attending at Stockton University is a huge difference then just going to a regular school. I get to meet so many cool, intelligent people from different parts of the world. The school is huge it’s self and it’s a lot of places on campus you get to explore and get great experience. The staff are very kind and the professors are very cooperative. The main thing I love the most about my college is the tutoring center, if I’m struggling with something or having a hard time understanding there are other students or professors who schedule to help you. Fun things I enjoy about Stockton is when we have celebrities come to the school and watch them perform. The college is makes all the students feel safe and welcome and it’s s great college overall."
Senior,5,"Pros: Great professors in the psychology department
- Great locations between the Pine barrens and the ocean of Atlantic City
- Small classes, normally under 30 students
Cons: Food court, poor choices 
- Weird shuttle schedules
- Price is increasing"
Junior,5,"My overall experience at stockton was great. Everyone is friendly and it is easy to make friends on campus. Professors are really good at their job and are ready to help if you ever need assistance on assignments.Sports is really great if you're into that. The major sports on campus are soccer, basketball and lacrosse. These sports have a higher number of attendance during games. Party scene is okay. Most of the frats were kicked off campus for some reason but there are quite a few that still throw parties. If you're over 21 there are also bars and pubs in area like Pitney pub.Its lit on wednesday nights. There are other options like Borgata which most of the students go there on the weekends. Campus is the most safest. Nothing to be scared of or anything. Police are always patrolling the campus to make sure it is safe. There are so many clubs on campus who recruit members all the time if you're looking to get involved."
Sophomore,5,"I like that Stockton genuinely cares about the success of their students rather than the money going into the pocket of the school. The tuition is fairly priced, they gives a lot of aid and scholarships and they offer ways to finish in three years rather than four. The campus is beautiful and not far from many shops, malls, or convenience stores. Food is average but that is how most colleges are just like dorms. Easy to make friends and different ways to get involved through clubs, sports, or even on campus employment. Great school to be on a budget but pursuing a four year or masters degree."
Sophomore,5,The only issue I have seen while attending Stockton University has to be the fact that it is a backpack school. That term is thrown around campus to describe how dead and quiet it gets on weekends. Sometimes it is nice to have peace and quiet to yourself but other times you want to be able to walk around campus and see fellow classmates.
Niche User,5,Stockton is a modern and unique school that offers students a variety of learning styles that cater to each individual student. Stockton provides the students with highly classified staff and alumni to individually help each student learn. It is filled with diverse students.
Sophomore,5,Stockton is a great school that focuses on safety and cares about the students' education. Stockton offers several majors and holds high standards for students to get the job done. The main campus is really beautiful and kept clean.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love it here. Both the staff and students make this the perfect space for each individual to learn from one another and truly take advantage of all the academically advancing resources Stockton University has to offer.
Graduate Student,5,I am a graduate student at Stockton and received my BS from here. It is an amazing school and offers so many activities. There is always something to do. Greek life was an amazing experience that opens even more doors!
Freshman,5,They are very helpful and overall I had an amazing experience which made me take the decision of having this College as my pick to start my carrer in bussines.  Even if the campus isn't that big the people make up for it. There are so many different cultures yet they all find a common ground where they can be themselves.
Sophomore,5,"So far I have very much enjoyed my time at Stockton, I transferred here from a school that I disliked very much and now I know that this is the school for me. The campus is great, the general atmosphere is very welcoming, and I have noticed that almost everyone I know who has gone there in the past genuinely misses their years there."
Freshman,5,What I enjoy most about attending Stockton University is the broad range of classes for my major and concentration.
Freshman,5,"They are a very good school, the professors are really helpful. I have had fun so far in my freshman year and I intend on finishing school here."
Sophomore,5,"I love the location of Stockton, it's like a hidden gem. It's in the Pinelands, surrounded by vast beautiful woods. Stockton embraces individuality and creativity. Stockton’s new campus in Atlantic City allows students to experience both coastal and inland environments. The professors are fully dedicated to their students and are willing to help outside of the classroom. I love how environmentally friendly Stockton is with building green facilities and using technology to help reduce energy use.  Going to this school almost feels like being on vacation because of how many activities there are and beautiful sights to see. I like how the classes are smaller because you have more interactions with the professors and it’s easier to follow the material and ask questions. Stockton offers many unique clubs so you have the chance to pursue your hobbies and meet new people. I would make Stockton more diverse and definitely add more areas for parking."
Junior,5,"Stockton Is honestly such a great school! I transferred here from State university of New York at  Potsdam in Upstate NY and it was the best choice I have ever made. I highly suggest living on the Atlantic City campus its soooo much nicer and you will never run out of things to do. My ""dorm"" has a full kitchen so I don't eat at the dinning hall but i hear its good depending what one you go to."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere and people here. everyone is genuinely nice and the professors go out of their way to help students. The food could be better, but the cooking staff 100% make up for it by being kind and enjoyable to be around."
Freshman,5,I’m just a freshman in me second semester it form what I’ve experienced and what my professors have done for me says a lot about Stockton University. They are very open to help anyone in need but only if you make the time for them to help you.
Alum,5,I truly loved Stockton. It was my home away from home. I always felt so comfortable being there. They offered a wide variety of classes and activities.
Sophomore,5,Stockton has provided me with the ability to graduate in three years without going into any student debt.
Sophomore,5,"This school has the best people to be around. Morale with students is great because of how nice and the students and professors are. This alone makes me glad I chose to go to Stockton University. The professors care a lot and are very passionate. Depending on your major a lot of classes can be a cake walk but if you look you can find classes that challenge you. Great university, wouldn't want to be anywhere else"
Niche User,5,"I love Stockton. From the moment I stepped onto the campus, I knew I would love it. The local area is beautiful and serene. The campus itself is always improving and with it, the staff."
Junior,5,"I love this school. I had a scary experience one night I’m the apartment and the Stockton police came right away and took care of everything. Staff is really helpful and professors are always making sure that you’re on track. Beautiful nature paths available and you can even rent bikes. Laundry’s free if anything’s not working like a light bulb needs to be changed, maintenance will come fix it right away. Parking for the commuters is not so great definitely hard to find spots so you gotta get there extra early. BUT ITS STILL A GREAT SCHOOL"
Senior,5,"Stockton students carry a range of personalities, from athletes to theater majors, and more. There is a place for everyone here and on-campus campaigns are amazing."
Senior,5,i really  that Stockton is an Excellent university where we can get an education that ensure the best future . I really like the intimate environment of a small campus. It feels comfortable and people are nice and helpful. The only issue i've encountered is the limited parking spaces.
Niche User,5,"I am looking forward to studying physics in the new Unified Science Center.  I am overwhelmed by the assistance I have received from professors and faculty, in registering for a difficult course load my freshman year.  The faculty from academic advising and the learning access program have reached out to heads of departments and professors throughout all disciplines, to arrange the best schedule to fit my needs.  I reached out to a physics professor who gave me a tour last summer, and he went out of his way to help me get into a class.  During orientation I met the head of the math department and he knew who I was from other faculty members working collectively to assist me.  I would not have received this type of attention at a large institution.  I'm not sure I would have received this attention from any of the other 5 colleges where I was accepted.  I know I made the right decision to attend Stockton University."
Senior,5,"Stockton is a small school, but growing! The students are very friendly and open-minded, the campus is quiet but close enough to AC to provide some more event and party-type atmosphere if thats what you're looking for. The faculty could not be better, and class sizes are small. No TA will ever lecture or grade exams, professors are heavily involved in student life."
Junior,5,"I love the campus, I love the people on campus the professors. I love the sports at Stockton, I also play soccer for Stockton and I really love it."
Freshman,5,"What I like most about Stockton is the friendly faculty. When I was applying and made numerous visits to the college for appointments, the staff was very professional and knew every question I asked them. They would also make helpful recommendations on what should be done during the enrollment process. 

The campus is also very beautiful. Lake Fred looks sapphire blue with ripples of silver when the sun is shining. I could just picture myself going for a morning jog through the woods and around the lake."
Freshman,5,"I'm enjoying my time so far at Stockton. The teachers are phenomenal and classes are very interactive and intertwined with classmates in learning. There are a plethora of extra curricular activities for all kinds of people. Only fault is the traffic in and out of the area, being close to the main hospital in the area makes going to class or leaving at peak hours horrendous."
Niche User,5,awesome!! i love it very much.  The track coaches are very nice and so are the athletes.  I am excited to work towards the physical therapy program!!!
Freshman,5,Stockton University makes everyone feel as if they are at home.  I feel as if I am important to the people at my college.  I am not a number; I am a person.  Stockton University is the best place for me to go to school.  I could not imahine myself anywhere else.
Freshman,5,"Stockton is a great school. Most of the professors are laid back and well versed in their field. The campus is nice. Sometimes it can get a little boring, as stores and restaurants are a little bit of a drive. The campus could use more food options, especially healthy ones."
Niche User,5,"The campus size is perfect, not too big but not too small.  The classes are small enough that you can interact with the professors.  All classes are within walking distance.  The dorms are the perfect size and there are not a lot of people on each floor which is a good thing.  There are many opportunities to join different clubs and activities."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Stockton University. It is my second semester here and everyday I feel as though I am in a healthy challenging environment. All of my professors present great lessons and help engage my mind into seeking beyond. I highly recommend Stockton to everyone and I can’t wait to continue my education here.
Junior,5,"As a Hospitality and Tourism Management major, I can say that the professors get to know each and every student.  The education you receive is incredible because there are so many opportunities for first-hand experience in the field, internships, volunteer work, etc.  The campus is beautiful as well and so far my experience at Stockton has been the best I could ask for.  Although there is room for improvement in certain areas like parking, overall it is a great education.  The area surrounding Stockton is not that great though, so it is best to stay on campus if you are alone at night for any reason."
Junior,4,"Stockton is a conducive environment for learning. The mood here is super friendly. 	Students are willing to help when you need to get somewhere or need to get something done. I was impressed with the professors and their dedication to helping when the going got tough. The dark side of the moon is that if you are an introvert, you may have a difficult time trying to have a social life. My recommendation, join as many clubs as you can, and get to interact and build relationships. Failure to do this, you will live a solitary life, stuck behind your computer all day, typing what you are reading now."
Senior,4,Stockton University is a very nice looking school. I’ve transferred there from Rutgers-Camden because I wanted to be closer to home. It was a great  choice. Everyone was very helpful.
Sophomore,4,"I am a Stockton University student. It has been a year at Stockton and I think that it is a perfect university for those who want to perceive a degree in their home state like me. The campus is very neat and beautiful. When I joined the University, I was extremely worried about my classes, professors, and other people but everyone at Stockton was very welcoming and friendly. The campus is not very large but it has a wonderful lake near it where I visit whenever I wanted to relax. Apart from its outer beauty, the university has a wonderful clubs that I would recommend joining. I had joined a Bollywood dance club and I truly enjoyed it. Stockton has some great professor and they really care about their students. Also, the tutoring center is very helpful. The only improvement I would wish that the university should get is that they should have more minor in nutrition and other languages. Lastly, I definitely suggest Stockton University to anyone who is looking for a better college."
Junior,4,"Stockton University is an excellent college. Both in terms of classes, and overall experience. It simply has but one fatal flaw, and that is that it can be rather slow when it comes to communication. Nonetheless, I highly recommend Stockton University to anyone looking for a college."
Freshman,4,"I loved being a part of the tennis team, but I wish more people would get involved in extracurricular activities and that the administration planned more events. Academically, Stockton is okay."
Freshman,4,Not too demanding and some professors tried really hard to make sure we learned everything we had to learn for the course. Not a bad experience overall.
Freshman,4,I love attending Stockton because of the opportunities to get involved. I think a lot of students transfer because they don't give themselves enough time to be involved at Stockton. Stockton gets boring when you do not apply yourself on campus. I love taking the classes and I love being in a sorority and involved in community service.
Sophomore,4,"As someone from North Jersey and a person of color, I was worried that I would feel out of place at Stockton. Although it is not as diverse as I would like to see, the community surrounding Stockton is amazing and there are so many cool clubs that you are sure to find your tribe. I know so many people of the same background as me! I truly have enjoyed my experience at Stockton so far, most of the professors I've had so far have been great and very understanding. I've met great friends and I love that the campus isn't too big. It's much easier to get around places. It is a very inclusive school in my opinion. 

I would definitely recommend taking some classes in AC, the bus ride there is very relaxing and the AC campus is so nice and modern!

There are stores and malls nearby but you definitely would need a car or know someone to access it."
Junior,4,"So far, my experience at Stockton University has been very good. You get the chance to meet a lot of people with a wide range of backgrounds. I have had no problems with any professors, as they are all extremely helpful."
Senior,4,"Stockton is a smaller school which allowed me to get involved easily. Over the last four years, the school has introduced me to many opportunities that I may not have received from other colleges."
Freshman,4,"Stockton University is a school thats makes you feel safe and welcomed. As a freshmen, my overall experience so far has been very positive. All the professors have been willing to help me and guide me with some informational insight for my future, especially since I came in as an undecided major."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Stockton University is that it has small sized classes, however, it is large enough to be a university and always meet new people. The academics at Stockton are excellent with a wide range of courses. No matter what your major may be, Stockton is open to all students with different majors and has more than enough classes to choose from that fit you. Stockton consists of diverse groups and everyone is always kind to one another."
Senior,4,"I liked Stockton University, the quality of education was very good, and if you take challenging classes, you will be challenged. Many professors are superbly qualified to teach the class, and while some more than others are better at explaining concepts, it was easy to learn. There is much diversity and a good amount of activities to do on the main campus and the Atlantic City campus, the food is not amazing, safety is very apparent in Atlantic City since there is much security. There are a lot of commuter students and there is not much of a party scene here. Athletics are mediocre, and while the new dorms are nice, they are expensive. Older dorms are cheaper, but in worse shape. Parking is hard to come by, but is doable as long as you don't mind walking. All around, it was a good experience."
Freshman,4,"Stockton University is a great way for students to not only save money, but get a great education with professors who genuinely care about their students success. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the building and classrooms are always clean, and the courses provide great knowledge towards careers in the future. The few small downsides to Stockton are in terms of parking, dorms, and food. Most students that attend Stockton are commuters and parking is not the greatest. The dorms are slightly smaller, but it is not the worst. There is a wide variety of food options as well, but more could be added. One last great aspect to Stockton is the fact we have great sports teams, with coaches who genuinely care about your education first, as well as making the sport fun to play."
Freshman,4,"Overall an amazing college,  though the food variety is not that great, it does have an active environment which sadly most students do not participate in."
Sophomore,4,"I like how friendly everyone on campus is: peers, professors, and other staff members. The campus has a lot of land, I like that they provide the option of taking a shuttle, as well as having shuttles to AC. Another perk is all the events the school has, like the spring concerts with artists like Jesse McCartney, PnB Rock, and Kesha."
Freshman,4,"Stockton Univeristy is a great and fairly inexpensive University. The University truly cares about its students and goes out of it's way to help its students. Everyone is friendly and it isn't hard to make friends. The academics are fantastic, with there being phenomenal staff and instructors that make a very engaging learning environment. Food and housing are fair, but nothing too special. It is a predominantly commuter school, which makes for a very scarce Campus during the weekends. Aside from that, I have very much enjoyed my time at Stockton."
Freshman,4,Stockton is a great university. The class sizes are mostly the size of high school classes-- which allows professors to get to know and help students. Its only 20 minutes from the beach which is nice and they also have an Atlantic city campus. Theres many stores and restaurants that are not far from campus. freshman can keep their cars there for free! Stockton is perfect if you are looking for a school that is smaller but still has much to do!
Senior,4,"The simple description of ""small liberal arts school"" really doesn't apply anymore to Stockton.  They've expanded so many of their undergrad programs, and even grown in the area of regional aviation industry with the new National Aviation Research & Technology Park."
Sophomore,4,"I like Stockton University. The only true downside to it is the parking situation. The professors have been great and I've been able to get involved on campus. As a commuter, I found the adjustment difficult at first, but once I got involved I began to truly appreciate all that Stockton has to offer."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Stockton has been pretty good so far. I really like the classes that I am taking. I feel like I am learning a lot. There's also a lot of diversity at Stockton, which is really nice. The school isn't too big so getting from one class to the next is easier. Stockton also has a lot of available resources for its students, like the tutors for students that need help."
Junior,4,"So far, Stockton has been a good school for me. Everyone is very helpful, especially the professors."
Freshman,4,I pretty much loved everything about Stockton from the dorms to the community and the diverse student population. the school gives off a bright and positive vibe
Sophomore,4,This School is very open and trusts their students. Gives us room to grow and learn. Professors are great and student life is great. You would never be bored at Stockton.
Freshman,4,"Seeing as I am an incoming freshman, I can only speak for what I've seen through campus visits, orientation, and tours. There are a plethora of courses offered at Stockton, which helps all students, not just myself. Also, the student body is extremely diverse and welcoming. All of my experiences have been great with bothy of these areas. One grievance would be the cost, but it is not the school itself; it is more of my financial situation (the freshman dorms are a little snug, but that is normal)."
Alum,4,"My experience at Stockton University was a refreshing one! The top aspect that stood out to me was the quality of professors. They really care about their students' success and are willing to work with you until you fully grasp the content being taught. The only aspect that could be worked on is the availability of parking spaces, especially for afternoon classes."
Junior,4,I love the school's mainland campus. It is the perfect escape from the stress that schools brings. Since it is a commuter school there are barely any people on campus during the weekend and I would love for the school to somehow change that by hosting more activities during the weekend.
Junior,4,I love how clean the campus is and I also like the professors that I have had there. My experience there has been nothing but amazing and I have made some amazing friends. I do wish that there were more club sports but other than that I really haven't had any complaints. My schedule is always organized and every single class I have had I've learned many valuable lessons.
Sophomore,4,"Stockton university offers a wide variety of courses and majors with professors who both passionate and good at teaching. The campus is incredibly compact, clean, and safe with campus police in large numbers who are always willing to help. This university offers a wide variety of social and sports clubs to fit all interests. I would warn this, it is anything but a party school. Most social activities are done in the form of these clubs and the campus remains relatively quiet. Additionally, the athletics department is lacking significantly. Overall this school is academically driven with outstanding professors, relatively inexpensive, and incredibly safe. I would consider it a good value if you do not value sports or the party scene."
Sophomore,4,"Stockton has allowed me to make tons of new friends and try new things with all of the events they offer on campus. With the resources they provide you can always receive help when you need it and can get in touch with professors when you have any questions about assignments. The campus is beautiful and I always enjoy walking past the lake when I’m on my way to class. With the smaller classes, I’m able to gain better connections with my professors and peers."
Niche User,4,"Stockton has a really beautiful campus, and provides an affordable education. The dorms, especially for upper classmen are some of the nicest I've seen. If I could improve anything, it would be the food. The cafeteria doesn't have a diverse selection."
Freshman,4,"Stockton University is a great university to get your education, many people commute here to this university. Stockton still has much progress to make, but it is growing and I am excited to see what will happen with the university in the future."
Sophomore,4,"I love that Stockton has a diverse campus. There are many options for clubs, team sports, and constant activities. The professors tend to care about each of their students and the classroom sizes are often small enough to be personal. The campus is absolutely beautiful and I get to walk by a giant lake and view the sunsets every day to and from class. I seems very safe at night besides a few mishaps but I do not worry."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Stockton, it has a very good atmosphere for learning and it is very open-minded. It was an easy transition to stay on campus here with the help of professors and RAs. The food sometimes is subpar but they give out some good vegetarian and some good vegan food options."
Alum,4,"I really loved all of the ways to get involved at Stockton, as well as the way that the professors really invested their time into bettering their students.  Something that I would like to see change would be the way the school handles sexual assault allegations."
Junior,4,"I am currently attending Stockton University. So far in my career here, I have taken courses with a variety of professors; many of them care a great deal about their students and job, but there are a few  who seem to lack such enthusiasm and passion. 
There are many clubs and activities on campus; there is something for everyone! However, the university is not huge on athletics (we do not have a football team) or the party scene, which I do not mind.
Both the Galloway and Atlantic City campuses are beautiful and perfect for those who love nature."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Stockton University has been overall amazing! I love the campus and there's a niche for everybody here. There has been a little safety issue these past two semesters, but Stockton is doing everything they can to keep their campus safe for their students. Other than that, the food has so many options and the professors are super helpful. Stockton is an overall great college to spend my next four years at."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my experience at Stockton university. There are always activities going on and a lot of organizations to join where everyone is very friendly. Their career center has helped me out a lot; I went to them for a mock interview before my graduate school interview and found it very helpful. Each students gets assigned a preceptor based on their field of study and mine went above and beyond for me.ee
Sophomore,4,"Stockton University is located in the heart of the pineland reserve of Southern New Jersey. This provides a mesmorizing aestic for all students to enjoy. Food is good, and plenty of places to eat both on and off campus using credit. Several clubs to get involved in as per usual, with the chance of starting your own club."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Stockton is definitely a financial win! I haven't had any issues from so far academically. The social scene is starting to evolve a little more, but could still be better. The campus is a little small compared to other colleges. If you're looking for something big I would consider other options!"
Freshman,4,"I love Stockton, I feel it has a very homey feel to it and its super welcoming. However, it is hard being away from home. Stockton has a lot of great opportunities as well. Its one of the only schools that allows students to live in apartments with full kitchens on campus when comparing to other schools. Which is cool because Im not stuck eating the same thing everyday. However, the food is overpriced and often times the food places close so early. Way too early. The gym isn't open 24/7. Overall, great place to be. you have great connections with professors, laundry and printing are free."
Freshman,4,The welcoming environment they showcase and friendly background and what they offer to its students to their interests and hobbies.
Sophomore,4,"Easy to navigate campus. Had sciences with labs. close to the beach, atlantic city, and phila. parking, sports/events, and campus life could be cooler."
Senior,4,A great small school atmosphere! The school is upgrading and expanding as we speak. They just opened a second location on the atlantic city beachfront. Small class sizes which makes for a great education
Sophomore,4,"Stockton is a really friendly environment and the professors are really helpful. The school atmosphere is like any other. If you want to do stuff, you have to get involved. Opportunities aren't going to come at you, you have to go to them."
Senior,4,"I think the professors are excellent with lots of experience out in the field not just academics.

 As a non-traditional it is very hard to be accepted by the rest of the student body not sure how they could change that"
Sophomore,4,"Stockton overall is a beautiful college, between the offering very diverse academic opportunities to offering an abundance of student life opportunities, Stockton is a great college to go to."
Senior,4,"Stockton University is literally in the middle of woods, and that's alright with me. Stockton is very much a green college; the university is pretty heavily wooded and even has a lake in the middle of it. The administrators focus heavily on maintaining a sustainable design, such as their geothermal cooling systems. 

Class sizes never exceed 100 students; I would say that the average class size is probably around 30 per class. Because of this, the professors will know your name, so it's essentially like high school in the effect. The vast majority of professors have PhDs in their field and are actively doing research. 

Major parties only happen off campus because we don't have any Greek houses on campus. There may be a couple parties with large groups of friends, but those usually get shut down quickly. Don't go to Pi Kappa Phi parties! 

Off-campus amenities are less than favorable. You will need a car to get around, and the closest grocery store is probably a 10-15 min drive."
Freshman,4,"It is very military friendly, this is great for me because I am a proud military spouse who loves to see my fellow families gain the new adventures that get to unfold while gaining a degree."
Junior,4,I am a transfer student from Rowan College of Gloucester County and my experience at Stockton from just taking tours and adventuring around the campus I have seen and learned about the philosophies of Stockton for which I am very excited to continue my education and obtain my degree in Financial Planning and also take my CFP exam at Stockton also.
Alum,4,"very good professors and campus faculty, fun events, lack of diversity, in the middle of the woods, decent campus food"
Senior,4,"Excellent university overall, but I nelieve the education offered could be improved. By the education I mean how some professors give their courses and the strategies used. Another issue seen at Stockton University is the limited parking spaces, which affect residential life on campus since commuters have to park in residential parking at times."
Freshman,4,"I have attended Stockton for my very first year. It was an anxious but exciting experience to be away from home and get to see what it was like living away from family. Stockton is a very quite place and is not too close to the city. It provides student's with great services such as tutoring, counciling and much more. I was able to make some new friends and grow who I am. The things I do wish to change from Stockton is their food options. There are not many varieties and it can be difficult for someone who has to watch what they eat."
Freshman,4,"Stockton University's campus has a beautiful environment and is full of so many opportunities. There is housing on both sides of campus separating the freshman from the upperclassman. The dorms have a significant amount of space. The education students receive here is excellent, every time someone steps out of the classroom they learn something new. The teachers care about their students and only want to see them do well. The tuition is at an appropriate price based on all of the free resources  they provide and whether or not the students take advantage of it. The one thing Stockton can improve on is the activities that occur over the weekends. There could be better and more healthy options, but the campus has a nutritionist for free who can help with eating healthy while dining on campus. I definitely would recommend Stockton to anyone who is looking for a public school close to home."
Freshman,4,"I love the environment, the facilities, activities, and the classes at Stockton. The parking, however, is terrible and residential students tend to be more excluding towards commuting students."
Alum,4,I loved going to Stockton. It is a very inclusive campus and there are so many resources to help you succeed.
Senior,4,"Parking is a nightmare! & Communication leaves a lot to be desired with different events and registering for things like graduation.
That being said it is an easy school for a commuter, it is in a nice location that is safe I never worry about walking out to my car. There is plenty to do in the areas surrounding campus close to shopping restaurants & only 20 minutes from Atlantic City and beaches. Overall a good experience and price friendly for those that live in the area."
Senior,4,"Stockton offers a wide range of programs with very realistic application of the material and opportunities for students to learn and use their skills outside of the classroom. For stockton, I would really only like to see change in their meal options for students. This school is amazing to be apart of."
Sophomore,4,"Stockton is a very small tight knit School. They have a beautiful campus, and are trying to expand. Professors there are very understanding and helpful, the only dislike i have about the school is the lack of activities and space there is for student involvement."
Junior,4,"Stockton University is a great school for multiple reasons. It's academic programs are among the best in New Jersey, and small class sizes help students build relationships with professors."
Junior,2,I believe the stockton administration was very unprepared for the shift to online learning. Professors were untrained and struggled operating and navigating through online technology. As a result of this most professors just piled an over barring course load on their students to compensate for the missed in person class time. Students began to struggle and with a lack of resources for helping students cope with these stressors a lot of students struggled keeping their grades a float.
Freshman,2,"When I visited, I was amazed by the beautiful campus, the very low price, and by how nice everyone seemed to be. This amazement quickly began to wear out as the weeks passed by, and the school began to show its true colors.

As classes began, I was simply blown away by how easy the material was, how low the expectation was for student performance was, and the fact that students were STILL unable to meet this expectation! I wasn't the best student in high school, yet I was consistently able to score 20 points above the average on tests and quizzes.

My second complaint has to do with the lack of social life on campus. The problem is not only the large commuter population at Stockton but the large percentage of the student body that lives within an hour's drive of the school. This leaves the campus utterly empty every weekend.

If you are looking for a legitimate education, and a school with decent student life, Stockton is NOT the school for you."
Alum,2,"well, I think the diversity suck at this university. It was hidden racism in the air. But the food, lake, and classes was good. Tuition sucks!!!"
College Freshman,2,I'm not an athlete and practically never use the athletic equipment. There is no football team or any team that the students are particularly passionate about. The sports teams are very good and win often though but are very under supported.
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have a footbal teaml, which is the highlight at most schools. We are a D3 school so none of our sports are that good, but students come out especially against Rowan in any sport."
College Sophomore,2,There is no one really in Greek Life here. Most groups bring Greek life here from other colleges because there is either like 1-5 people in that Frat/Sor. None really through parties expect for ones that got kicked off campus.
College Freshman,2,"I highly considered joining Greek Life upon entering college, however I have decided against joining. I asked several of my older classmates and none of them seemed to think much of sororities besides the matching shirts and petty rivalries. At Stockton, joining Greek Life is not worth the hundreds of dollars."
College Freshman,2,Greek life on this campus has a bad rep. More than half of the frats are banned and the sororities are all hated on
College Freshman,2,There is very little if any school spirit. I have yet to see anyone get excited for a game or a tournament that is happening on campus.
College Freshman,2,"I would say that there is not too much diversity on campus when you compare it to other colleges and universities. In my Freshman Seminar, we looked at the statistics, and close to 75% of faculty is white. That is no very diverse at all. As for the student body, I would say there is more diversity than faculty, but white is still the majority of students on campus."
College Freshman,2,"This school is bad with small upsides. I do like the classes and most of my professors are extremely smart and approachable however the atmosphere of the school is rather.... lower class. Students excessively drink and do drugs. Maybe this is how all colleges are??? I just find it astonishing how much money people pay to get drunk, high, and skip classes all the time. The students who aren't participating in these activities are involved with video games and anime. When you're somewhere in between like me... you find yourself very much estranged. The dorms suck. The dorms are small and we have mice. Parking is a nightmare. If you do not get a spot in the lot by your dorm, you must park across campus which is a 30-45 minute walk (I have timed it). The sports teams are really bad. I know we're D3 but they're so bad the games aren't even competitive. Lastly, the food at this university is absolutely repulsive. The only thing they offer at the student restaurant is different variations of potatoes (ex. french fries, roasted potatoes, potato pancakes, etc.) There is no nutritional value to the food at Stockton University. Most of the time the dishes are dirty that they expect you to use. I ended up gaining over 20 pounds within the first few months of college because the only food on campus that was edible was the Chick Fil A."
College Freshman,2,"If you go to N-Wing, be prepared to eat soggy pizza and vegetable stew everyday. If you go to the Food Court, good luck getting full without going over your spending limit."
College Junior,2,"Guys here are pretty standard - snapbacks, t-shirts, and socks with sandals (gross). Also, probably about half of them are Greek. Many have openly negative attitudes towards women. Apps like Tindr and Yik Yak are pretty abundant among the male population, and the overwhelming majority are here to party and hook-up. Mostly white dudes - not a lot of diversity.

Now, the ladies? Hollaaaaaaaaaaaa."
College Junior,2,"Parties are usually only ever on weeknights making it difficult for people who have early classes. Most parties are through frats or sports teams, who only ever invite their friends."
College Junior,2,"There are pretty much no healthy options on campus whatsoever...There are also very limited options on the upperclassman side other than Lakeside Lodge, which is especially difficult in the winter/bad weather."
College Junior,2,Everything is pretty far away from campus. Mostly Greek life and a lot of the same people at parties and costs too much to go out.
College Junior,2,I don't really like anything on campus. A lot of it is very processed or a lot of the same things all of the time. I prefer cooking my own food.
College Freshman,2,Do not come to this school!
College Freshman,2,I'm not very interested in the Greek life.  I've heard there is a lot of hazing on campus from the upper classmen Greek sororities and fraternities.
College Sophomore,2,"Having seen the quality of parties elsewhere, parties here disgust and disappoint me. Almost all parties happen off campus at sketchy frat houses. These houses are not clean, are often in the woods, and rarely even have furniture. Parties RARELY serve anything other than nasty, cheap, watered-down beer that runs out quickly and takes too long to get. Girls have to pay to get in, where at most schools girls are free. If you bring your own alcohol you have to hide it or throw it out before going in - for  who knows what reason. Parties are mostly during the week and especially on Thursdays because everyone goes home on weekends so no one has parties. The only decent parties here are small, in-apartment parties with friends, and those can only happen if the RA is cool. Not a party school. Go visit a friend if you want a decent party, which actually works out better because you probably won't get in trouble with your own school if something goes wrong."
College Sophomore,2,"We are a D-3 school, with minimal offerings. No football team, which is a popular college sport and often brings in a sense of school-spirit and connection with nearby schools. The sports teams we do have hardly get any attention or following, and are simply there for people to continue their high school activities. We have two gyms/sport complexes, but both are very small with limiting hours of operation and old equipment. We are offered plenty of very good classes to go to at various times during the week, including yoga, jiu-jitsu, kick boxing, and more. We have a fairly decent nutritionist who helps students find what healthy options the school has to offer. As an active individual and school-spirited student, I'd appreciate better facilities and a foot ball team."
College Freshman,2,I try getting more money because financial aid barely helps so I am waiting to see if the school grants me scholarship money.
College Freshman,2,N-Wing is only good for breakfast and possibly sometimes lunch. Campus center is where I usually went.
College Sophomore,2,"There are no faculty parking lots and when there is a convention or conference, there are NO parking spaces left for students!"
College Freshman,2,"While on campus the school does a good job of regulating drugs and alcohol. Many students still partake in it on campus, but ras are on top of things. Off-campus is a free for all. This is where all parties take place. There is a hospital on campus tho for those who take it overboard."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many minorities in this school. It is mainly white students. The school is fairly accepting, but social life isn't. Every party I've been to is mainly white kids."
College Senior,2,I didn't recover any scholarships that's why I am applying for them now
College Senior,2,One day it's cold next it's hot it's just tricky
College Junior,2,"Biggest problem at this school is parking. commuters can drive around for an hour looking for a spot, and commuters can park in some resident parking spots so then residents have no where to park."
College Junior,2,"Impossible to get into any science classes that you need. and if you're not a premed or pre-pt track biology major, the professors don't care about you. they don't have much advice for internships, future jobs, etc. they are just at a loss and cannot help."
College Junior,2,living by the ocean makes the weather crazy. the wind is always strong. but we get less snow than most areas
College Freshman,2,Everyone goes home on the weekends so parties are on week nights
College Freshman,2,Its mostly white but there are a few minorities.
College Junior,2,"Wifi has always been terrible, and computer labs never have schedules on the door of if there is a class inside or not, so I feel uncomfortable opening the door with the possibility of disrupting the class"
College Sophomore,2,Meal plans are ridiculously overpriced. You might as well light your money on fire. 
College Sophomore,2,"It has become very strict on campus, with noise violations constantly a problem. I have been told to pour out my Snapple iced tea when I walking to the parking lot to my car because they thought it was alcohol, even though I showed them that it wasn't."
College Sophomore,2,"It is overpriced for the space that you are given to live with 4-5 people, and RAs and cops like to make sure nobody has fun. "
College Freshman,2,"I got stuck with a reduced rate double even though i was not in need of a reduced rate room. It is the size if a single but with two people living in it. There is no room at all. So if you are able, try your hardest not to be in a reduced rate double. "
College Sophomore,2,"The school is in the middle of the pine barrens, not much to do on campus.  No place to get food after 12PM.  The food stinks, because it is all served/made by one company the school has hired.  Chartwells=Terrible food."
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, I kind of regret coming to this school. I had high expectations of the school from what I had heard from alumni. It hasn't lived up to those expectations at all. The professors are either great or horrible. The administration often gives bad or contradictory advice. I always try to see the bright side of things, but certain parts of this school make me very unhappy. "
College Sophomore,2,Almost everywhere you go on campus there will be a cop watching you. Makes me feel nervous even though I'm doing nothing wrong. They love to set up speed traps around the school entrances and give parking tickets. Beware!
College Sophomore,2,"What off campus dining? The only food places I've seen in Galloway are a Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Subway and Saladworks. If you took the 20 minute or so ride to Atlantic City to get food, then there a lot more options. "
College Sophomore,2,"Do NOT even try taking classes after 10 am on Tuesdays and Thursdays if you plan to commute. At 11 am yesterday, I had to search for 15 min for a spot. It might suck to wake up early, but I'd strongly suggest you take all classes before 10 am if you want any hope of finding parking. Two people almost hit my car yesterday while I was looking for a spot and someone backed into my tail light while I was at class. So WATCH OUT while you are in the parking lots!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The shuttles at Stockton are very slow, and cost every student $75 no matter where they live on campus and even commuters and those who live off campus have to pay it. "
Recent Alumnus,2,The computer labs at Stockton are always crowded and the internet is very slow. 
College Sophomore,2,"Stockton only has one dining hall on famous that only serves food that I like during breakfast hours. They are promoting healthy choices and vegetarianism however I would like to have a better selection, their are numerous fast food places to eat on campus but they make it very hard to be healthy."
College Junior,2,"Campus is strict, and a ghost town on the weekends. Most NJ students that attend stockton flock home for the weekends. Night life is all frat parties, off campus."
College Senior,2,"Drugs and Drinking – Drugs are not a big problem on campus, although if you are doing drugs you are probably smoking weed or cigarettes.  Drinking is more popular, and a lot of partying occurs regularly."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Stockton is a Division III school without a football team and athletics aren't a big part of campus culture. The only people who really give much thought to athletics are the athletes themselves. There's a fairly large IM contingent, which is entirely student run. The athletic facilities are really nice. There are two gyms, multiple weight rooms, and racquet ball courts."
College Sophomore,2,"I mean, it's not hard to make friends that have drug connections. It's not too bad, but if you really want some, you can get access to them."
College Sophomore,2,"Ehh, I didn't really see any big whoop about the campus itself. The campus center was just finished and it's really nice. Stockton is known for being a ""Green"" school s there are plenty of places to go on nature walks and to just relax by Lake Fred, if stuff like that is your cup of tea."
College Junior,2,The dorms on campus are really nice especially the newer ones as well as the new apartments. The older dorms and apartments are good as well altthough its hard to find the dorm/apartment you actually want just because there are many people who live on campus.
College Junior,2,Parking on campus is tough for both those who live on campus and the commuters. It is very hard to find parking unless you arrive really early and even then it could be trouble.
College Senior,2,The officers on campus are the same age as the students and abuse their power. Also the officers look for every little thing to give you a ticket for.
College Sophomore,2,"There is one public bus that goes off campus, I'm not exactly sure where it goes but you can get the schedule from the information desk. There is also a van transportation service that you can get the number for also known as the ""Drunk bus"", who will transport you late at night but they don't always show up at the time they said leaving you waiting. I believe it's important to try and have your own car here, giving the location and that the campus allows Freshmen to have cars. It's just more convenient."
College Senior,2,"Due to its close proximity to the shore, Stockton's weather fluctuates greatly. During the summer it is smoking hot, while in the winter it can snow up to a couple feet. For some reason I feel like it rains every other day though, and for that I am grading it as a C-."
College Sophomore,2,There are no good options when it comes to getting the best housing and being able to not have a meal plan. To get your own room you are forced to pay for a meal plan because there are no kitchens in the singles housing.
College Junior,2,"Very Isolated and quiet, but we are near Atlantic City known for their Casinos"
College Junior,2,The life at Stockton College is very different coming especially if you are coming from a city life area. The quietness of the college and natural settings are positive attributes but the quality of living is primarily low because of the unprofessional mannerism at the college.
College Junior,2,I have never attended a game. Sports are not really a huge part of our school.
Junior,1,No one is allowed free thought. If you do not drink the Leftist poison you will be penalized on grades and possibly even brought up on charges.
Junior,1,"The school is filled with and run by straight up Marxists who hate the county. If you are patriotic or conservative or just libertarian, prepare to be bullied, threatened, and put in danger by students, PROFESSORS AND ADMINISTRATION. Racism is alive and well. I was treated like a animal because of my skin color (white). It's basically Berlin 1938.

There is ZERO diversity of thought. Everyone is required to think in robotic, lockstep, Leftist orthodoxy. Seriously, they need to read 1984 because that's what they have created. It was toxic and emotionally quite damaging. Even if you try to keep to yourself, the woke stormtroopers will find you and force you into some dystopian social justice seminar. Leaving that campus is like escaping from a totalitarian country. If you attend but have not experienced, then try thinking for yourself once and see what happens to you."
Graduate Student,1,They are trying to make me pay what I paid for an in-person class instead of an online class even though this class was originally online. Bursar's office is worthless and the professors never email me back when I inquire about them taking points off for no reason because they are incompetent and don't know what they are doing.
Graduate Student,1,"I went here for undergrad and grad because I had no other options, but both were awful experiences. They always messed up the classes I needed to take, tried to charge me more for classes. The people in the office are useless and never resolve the problems you have. I have to continuously call and go to the offices to attempt them to fix any issue they caused bc of their incompetent staff. Now for grad school, I always paid 1950 per 3 credit online class, but now bc of COVID-19 they want me to pay what I paid for an in-person class. Of course, I called and complained and they said they'd change it and they didn't. Professors are just as useless and never respond to my emails and take points off for no reason. This school only causes me a headache."
Senior,1,"Prior to COVID-19 I had a class that was perfectly designed to be taken online. Once being home and forced to take the rest of my online, some professors were extremely rude and useless."
Freshman,1,It was boring. A lot of people live close by so everyone would go home on the weekends. Parties were okay. The professors were easy though.
College Sophomore,1,I don't like these sort of groups
College Junior,1,The Greek Life at Stockton is very selective and extremely critical of other Greek organizations. Non-greeks and Greeks tend to have very low opinions of each other.
College Freshman,1,On my FAFSA I received $7000 in grants opening entering school I was informed they had been taken away and given to someone else. needless to say I will be transferring out after I complete this year.
College Sophomore,1,I have never seen one security guard on campus and that is a HUGE concern for me!
College Senior,1,It's hardly any of them there
College Freshman,1,There's not a lot of healthy options and the ones that are healthy are very expensive.
College Freshman,1,When it rains parking is terrible
College Freshman,1,We have a campus shuttle and it sucks. There is never a definite time thats you can count on it to be there. It doesn't cost but it would just be easier if you had your car in campus. 
College Junior,1,i like living on campus no gas wasted
College Sophomore,1,Morning classes are the best for parking spots. After 12 p.m. in the afternoon its horrible. One I wasted almost quarter of a tank of gas for half a hour trying to find a spot before class started. I advise you to take morning or after 2 o clock classes.
College Junior,1,They keep expanding the campus onto the parking lots because they are on pinelands and can only build so much land. The best way to get parking is to get their before 8 am because the first classes start at 830am. Also the spots are tight so be careful who you park next to because some people use your doors to stop theirs when they open them.
College Junior,1,"The nice thing is that you do not have to pay to park on campus, and freshmen can have cars, but since there is construction going on parking has become ridiculous, especially if you are commuting.  Most people are averaging 30 minutes to find a parking spot.  Residential parking is better but our school has a lot of commuters."
College Student,1,I have not received any scholarships from Stockton thus far
Recent Alumnus,1,"Stockton decided to build a new Science building in a parking lot which took up a lot of spots making it more difficult to find a parking spot when you arrive for class.  Most times, you are forced to park in North Lot which is at least a 10 minute walk of longer."

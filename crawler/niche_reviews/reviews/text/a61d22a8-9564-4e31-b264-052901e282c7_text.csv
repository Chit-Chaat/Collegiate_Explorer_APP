Junior,5,"Boston University has implement a program called LFA where students can Learn from Anywhere. Professors record and upload all zoom meetings. If you’re on campus, you’re eligible to go to class with rotations. Classes are less than half capacity with socially distanced desks. All students must get tested twice a week if on campus. Everything is recorded on zoom and is available for students to watch anytime. Most exams are open during a 12 hour period."
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online and cannot attest to BU's online classes. It was however, very easy to like up with Professors and receive notes and assignments over their online course system."
Alum,5,"I loved how Boston University is such an integral part of Boston. Located on Commonwealth Ave, BU is an arms throw from Fenway and right on the Charles River. As an athlete, it was perfect for running and cycling. School buildings were easy to get to and I always enjoyed meeting up with friends either out in the city or on campus."
Graduate Student,5,"The online experience has been an adjustment, but overall extremely successful. Professors answer questions via Zoom chat."
Graduate Student,5,I love the Charles River campus. All Boston University professors are incredibly intelligent and provide endless resources for student's success.
Sophomore,5,Great school with amazing opportunities. Very big school with good sense of community. Less resources for individual students.
Freshman,5,"Unfortunately, I can't help with this one since I don't have any experience in online learning at Boston University"
Freshman,5,I love BU. I love its diverse student body and its excellent setting. The athletics department could be a bit better tho
Freshman,5,"The academics are extremely challenging, yet rewarding. I am a month into my first semester and I love it despite COVID limitations. There are many clubs available to join."
Niche User,5,The online experience was amazing. It was as if I was studying in a class. The teachers tried their best and I loved online learning.
Niche User,5,"Amazing University. The application process to the university was very quick and easy. The students are very nice, helpful and co-operative and the teachers too are very helpful and kind. The learning environment is great as well. Definitely recommend."
Senior,5,"In the quick switch to online learning this past spring, my professors all did an excellent job of providing resources (such as online textbooks) and accommodating student needs."
Junior,5,The professors are much more understanding and cooperative on the online format. They are easier with grading and offer more time for students to ask questions and make sure everybody is on track.
Senior,5,"Being a student at Boston University is a genuinely rewarding experience. The academics, professors, courses, and programs are superb, and the college experience in the city of Boston is unmatched."
Senior,5,"I was fortunate that my major program and courses were easily transferrable to an online format, so I did not struggle too much with online learning. Professors are required to post the recorded lectures online, so the information is easily accessible. Also, professors were extremely understanding and accommodating throughout the semester."
Alum,5,N/A. I went to school in-person and full-time during my undergraduate years. I didn't realize that Boston University offered online learning modules.
Junior,5,"Most professors were really good at making the transition from in-person to online classes during the pandemic smooth. Especially in science courses where lab could no longer be conducted in person, students were still able to learn a lot."
Sophomore,5,"The professors made the best of it and were so lenient with us. I was so worried about not doing as well but I ended up doing better than usual! They were so understanding. Of course, I'd rather be in-person, but for what it was, the school was incredible."
Alum,5,I truly enjoyed my time at Boston University. I majored in Mechanical Engineering at the College of Engineering. They had a diverse staff when it came to women as well as people of color. I really felt prepared for the work force when I graduated due to the seminars and resume reviews. They had many successful job fairs as well. In the classes I really enjoyed listening to professors who were experts in their field speak about their subjects with passion. My fellow students were also a big reason why I loved my time at BU. They were just as excited as I was to learn about engineering and follow their passions.
Alum,5,I didn't have to take any classes online but I'm sure they would have been great due to the level of professionalism they put into their in-person classes.
Graduate Student,5,"If it wasn't for COVID-19, I would have not needed to take any online classes. But because of COVID-19 all teachers were smooth about the transition from in person classes to online classes. I was pretty impressed with all the teachers. Even tho I never am fond of online classes but my professor makes it good."
Graduate Student,5,My experience at Boston University is honestly the most amazing experience. I have learned so much. (I am in Graduate program - Deaf Education) My cohorts and I are all into the program and we continue to wanting to learn more and that is what it makes it so much fun. I would totally encourage anyone to go to Boston University.
Sophomore,5,"Boston University feels like home. Transitioning was much less difficult than expected and if you reach out to the resources provided, you will be supported."
Sophomore,5,I took online classes during COVID-19 (from March to July) and the professors were very accommodating and putting learning at the center. We were provided several resources and adaptable office hours.
Graduate Student,5,"From being admitted into the University to registering and taking my first course, I've been impressed with the school's communication and care they have for their students."
Graduate Student,5,"From being admitted into the University to registering and taking my first course, I've been impressed with the school's communication and care they have for their students."
Graduate Student,5,"I did not take any classes online. I did, however, take online tutorial sessions. These tutorials are relevant and useful in my field of study."
Graduate Student,5,"I took one summer course at BU and I loved it. The professor was approachable and the material was engaging. All the classes offered and professors are of high quality. Professors and BU staff in general are very accommodating to students’ needs. The social scene is great because there are bars and late-night restaurants open for students. BU’s location is situated in the city of Boston where students can check out the Boston Common as well as restaurants and malls in Newbury, Prudential center, and Downtown Boston.
The first thing I would change about BU is its affordability and spending habit. BU is an expensive school and is not known for giving out generous financial aid. Also, BU doesn’t spend money on things that students care about such as hosting social events, building or improving new facilities, etc. I’d like to see BU create affordable financial aid packages for graduate students and spend their money on stuff or events to match students’ interests."
Graduate Student,5,"I liked the diversity in the student body and staff. Students from all over the world chose to call Boston University home, and it was truly a delight to meet so many different people. The staff were very friendly, and the professors engaged everyone in thoughtful discussions about race, politics, government structure, and countless other topics. I am also distinctly proud that we are starting a research program to research the lasting effects of slavery and racism in America, and whether reparations must be made. For what there is to change, I would merely recognize individual issues with finding a sense of belonging. Boston University does an exceptional job at addressing the issues, but many students still fall through the cracks. I believe there needs to be greater outreach to minority student groups, especially in these uncertain times, about their mental health and long-term stability at school."
Graduate Student,5,"I took all of my classes online when it became necessary, and there were few logistical issues with my professors. The only recurring issue was being able to present the slides without initial issue in connection. The professors did an excellent job of encouraging student discussion, continuing with class routines as normal, and making light of the events and acknowledging students' needs for extensions, additional office hours, and other additional requests. The only issue with the online learning experience at BU was the increased apathy by the student body. Even though classes were given the option of being marked ""Pass"" or ""Fail"" after the semester's end, many students' grades dropped substantially. Many, including myself, still worry about the potential negative effects of marking required courses with such symbols. Otherwise, Boston University has done an exceptional job in transitioning students to online teaching."
Freshman,5,"I am super excited to attend in the fall. I feel very included and can already tell how diverse and welcoming BU will be. I am reached out to every day by staff, students and alum."
Freshman,5,"I am super excited to attend in the fall. I feel very included and can already tell how diverse and welcoming BU will be. I am reached out to every day by staff, students and alum."
Niche User,5,"I have not taken any online classes yet so I can't legitimately review this, but I like BU enough to know that they shouldn't be too bad."
Senior,5,"Teachers were pretty understanding for the most part. Classes were honestly easier online. As long as you can motivate yourself, you will be fine. But honestly if you can't motivate yourself to do the work at home, you probably weren't going to do the work for an in person class either. So in the end, no difference in my opinion."
Junior,5,"The university itself will push you to become a better human being, that being by either the people you meet, the classes you take, or network you will make."
Junior,5,The online experience I had with online learning was caused because of COVID-19. I believe the professors were able to quickly accomodate for the online teaching style (not affecting much of the course).
Sophomore,5,The campus is amazing and the city is super lively. I’ve made so many memories just being in the city and wandering with my friends. The academics are also amazing and I feel challenged enough to want to become a better version of myself.
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved BU. It made me the person that I am today. It gave me 16 best friends that have grown to a community of over 30 wonderful friends as our families have grown. The student experience was stellar. You get what you pay for. Facilities are often new and renewed. The fitness center is out of this world awesome. Lots of housing options, though some are better than others."
Senior,5,"Boston University is an incredibly rigorous school with a large research basis and esteemed professors. Although the courses are hard, it is well worth it for the connections and education level. In addition, the campus is stunning and right near the heart of Boston which has so much to offer."
Freshman,5,Can't wait to go back! Such a great experience overall. 10/10 would recommend. yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Alum,5,I had a great experience from 2008-2012. Boston University has the best campus housing and incredible dining options! I loved that the campus was right in the heart of Boston.
Senior,5,"I transferred into Boston university as a sophomore. The transition was very easy, and I had my advisor helped me a ton. The course work is hard and you really have to put time into it. However, I have never had professor who wasn't willing to take the time out to help. Boston University is also so close to wonderful food and shopping. Which has been a great way to explore on the weekends with friends."
Sophomore,5,"BU students have the unique opportunity to go to school without a campus in the city. Visit it before you decide to come if you can, some people might not like the non-campus vibe."
Alum,5,Better architecture. I would like the school become more liberal arts oriented and less professional oriented especially in the undergraduate level.
Senior,5,Great school! Wonderful students and amazing opportunities for undergraduates. Could have better student health facilities.
Graduate Student,5,"The amazing location, right in the heart of the city, along with it's sprawling campus is a treat. The world-renowned faculty along with the career development center is of great help when it comes to learning and it's utilization."
Freshman,5,"I really love it here; there is so much to do, it’s easy to get around campus, and it’s easy to find your people. I got an on-campus job easily and am involved in lots of wonderful, welcoming extracurriculars."
Alum,5,"Beautiful campus that is integrated into the city of Boston. Local area is amazing. Be sure to venture out for great food, shopping, and entertainment, all of which are close in proximity to campus. Great housing options such as those on Bay State Road. Safety was never an issue for me."
Freshman,5,Picked this school over a comparable offer and it's absolutely been worth it so far. Love living on an urban campus with so much to offer!
Alum,5,"Boston University was the perfect place to grow as an individual and cultivate the kind of adult I wanted to be. I was inspired to be forward, be myself, and be the change I wanted to see in the world."
Sophomore,5,"Fabulous city to study in! Love the diversity here. Although it's not a closed campus it is extremely safe. There is so much to do in Boston! The culture, the people, my peers & professors are inspiring. The best decision I ever made was to commit to Boston University. My education will be invaluable!"
Freshman,5,I absolutely love BU and everything it has to offer! I highly recommend this school as long as you are willing to work hard and make the most out of every opportunity they have to offer.
Senior,5,A lot to do and a lot to see. You have to actually try in your classes because it's not easy but that's what makes it fun and challenging.  You'll meet people from all over the world and get to have so many incredible and unique experiences. Boston University gives you all the resources to succeed in college but it's your responsibility to take advantage of these resources.
Freshman,5,"It has been everything I have wanted! Sure, some classes are better than others, but I find that BU is so supportive of the students.
My only suggestion would be to make some scholarship options for returning students because it is pretty expensive."
Junior,5,The academics are extremely difficult and challenging but you will learn from the best. Te food and housing is amazing as well.
Sophomore,5,"An amazing school with excellent, pioneering opportunities in a number of fields. Location is stellar and has many resources to ensure success."
Alum,5,"I loved the campus culture and the diversity. All of my professors were champions in their respected fields, so you got some real-world experience in the classroom. As a member of greek life, I would've liked to have seen the school embrace the Panhellenic community more."
Freshman,5,"So far attending BU has been an amazing experience. There are a vast amount of clubs and organizations to get involved with and everything has been wonderful. Some of the professors are hit or miss in terms of effective teaching, but overall they are good. Diversity isn't their strong suit but it isn't bad either. It is extremely expensive which is a big downside. The campus is beautiful and located in the middle of Boston with access to everything. Their athletics are Division 1 and very good. Lastly, the dorms are the in good shape and only get better as you get older. Overall I think Boston University is a great university"
Alum,5,"Excellent School, as a recent grad I cannot praise BU enough. It offers a diverse range of programs and there are numerous small communities within the school. Everyone has a place. Although it seems large with a decent student body, BU has divided into numerous smaller colleges. The professors within the colleges really care about the quality of learning that goes on. Fantastic experience, and a great school!"
Freshman,5,Boston University is challenging but it is a great place to attend college. The college is surrounded by an amazing city and there are plenty of things to do.
Junior,4,"Amazing opportunities. As international student, a lot of workshops available. Career advising is very helpful too. Classes are hard but with good time management, doable"
Alum,4,It  is a very well respected school. I got my undergraduate degree in Elementary Education. My class sizes were small for the most part. I feel that communication/advisors could be improved. I feel like I got an excellent education with great connections.
Alum,4,"I did not take any classes online, but blackboard was easy to use. Blackboard was used to submit assignments and view course documents and assignments."
Sophomore,4,Professors have no trouble using online resources and communicate very frequently. Less interaction with each student and harder to ask questions because of online.
Freshman,4,"Each professor has their zoom class set up differently. The hybrid model makes it nice to be able to have the in-person experience once in a while. While it's not perfect nor ideal, BU is doing their best. I do think that they should've lowered tuition since it is not the same as in-person instruction at all."
Junior,4,Professors seem nice and lenient regarding online learning and are also very accessible for help outside of class.
Junior,4,"Seems nice so far, but I haven't attended a class on campus yet so I can't speak very much on it. The campus is nice and obviously in a wonderful area."
Junior,4,"Taking classes online is definitely an interesting and new experience for me and for all of us. My professors have worked hard to make it work and I appreciate their efforts. So far, it is all conducted on Zoom and I am still able to ask questions and understand the material."
Junior,4,"I like the prestige, the campus, the need-based financial aid, and the culture for the most part. I was able to find POC students that became my good friends.

Cons: the dining halls, the distance from place to place on campus, too much regular dorms not enough apartments and suites so room selection sucks. The administration and professors can be fake and very selective."
Senior,4,"An excellent research university, with plenty of growth opportunities, such as for internships, leadership, and research. Some Professors have more limited office hours than are appreciated."
Alum,4,"Boston University provides a wonderful education for its students and has a rich campus culture that stimulates productivity and excitement for future careers. There is never a shortage of clubs or extracurriculars to join and the internship and job market in the surrounding areas is wonderful. BU is an extremely expensive school, however, and the return on investment is questionable depending what field your degree was in. The gym and food is probably some of the best you'll find on a college campus, but there was much to be desired in the housing situation. It doesn't seem like BU cared about maintenance for their older buildings (which were cheaper housing) and instead only invested in the new ones that cost an arm and a leg to rent for the school year. Overall, happy with my decision and happy to have been in Boston for my college years."
Junior,4,"I love BU, but they need to be more proactive in their support of BIPOC and LGBTQ students. They hold up MLK as one of their alumni and then barely support BLM. They're scared to take a stance on civil rights, but they brag about having civil rights leaders as alums. Sounds like performative allyship to me!"
Junior,4,"The school is great, however, there are little to no resources for students to use in regards to applying for scholarships and financial aid. Their website's resources to private scholarships are basically all expired."
Junior,4,Most classes transitioned well to online learning but some professors didn't make much of an effort to teach online.
Junior,4,"Great campus, many resources for students (free tutoring, innovation lab etc.), interesting courses. Quality of professor varies."
Senior,4,Boston Unviersity scouts high quality professors and has recently raised a lot of money to be invested in raising the quality of BU education. Boston University also has an Innovate Lab to help students who are interested in becoming entrepreneurs. The peers are motivated individuals which would exert positive influence.
Senior,4,professors are eager to learn new technology to improve online teaching. they are very responsive and reachable even in an online setting.
Alum,4,"Campus is in a great location. There is something for everybody, to the degree that you want to become involve in the school or not."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience was very smooth. Professors and TA's were very accommodating. However, there are a few professors who refuse to take into consideration the various time zones from which students join class and that some have to wake up in the middle of the night to participate. In my opinion, that is very inconsiderate of those professors and just outright unfair to the international students. I feel like the University as whole should create a policy to resolve that issue."
Junior,4,"I love Boston University, it feels like home. That being said, because I love it so much, I recognize that some things do need to change."
Sophomore,4,"I love Boston University! The education is absolutely incredible and I've pushed myself so hard in every part of it. I don't know if I'd feel as confident about my future career if I went to school anywhere else. 
I have made so many connections through student groups and my classes. I love the people here so much! It really becomes like a second home after you get settled.
The only downside is the price! I'm definitely going to have a lot of debt after graduation! I had to think about that a lot before deciding to attend, but I was lucky enough to get a job on campus (which is another perk!)."
Alum,4,Had a great time here except my advisor sucked and President Brown is a greedy old man. Finals were always incredibly tough.
Freshman,4,Seems like a great school so far! I am an incoming Freshman and they've been very transparent on their COVID reopening plans.
Senior,4,"My professors tried their best to adapt to an online learning format. The majority of them were very accommodating, especially with classes that would normally require being in person,such as labs. It could have been worse."
Senior,4,"Very strong rigorous academics in a great location with many opportunities.  However, tuition is a bit too high and keeps getting higher each year."
Junior,4,"Overall a good school! The campus is in the city, but because it is a large campus, it still feels like its own space. Most of the dorms are nice and there are also a lot of off-campus living options."
Niche User,4,"Pros: One of the best academics in the nation, and the HUB program gives students the opportunity to explore other subjects they feel passionate about while still focusing on their major. There are SO many clubs and activities going on around campus so you'll never feel bored. Being in downtown Boston (or around the globe if you're doing study abroad, #23 best in the US!), there are plenty of opportunities for research and internships, but you have to seek them out yourself. Diversity is excellent, and BU meets 100% financial need now, meaning it's more worth it to go here than ever before.
Cons: iffy dorms, but they're okay imo. Grade deflation is definitely a thing but I see it as a way to push yourself past your limits and grow rather than something the profs use to bully you with. And despite being a D1 school, hockey's really the only sport anyone cares about.
Overall I'm very excited to apply to BU this fall and I believe that in the end, it will be a pleasant experience for me."
Senior,4,I enjoyed my experience at Boston University. Most professors care about the students. I was in the business school and that was extremely cut throat and competitive.
Freshman,4,Quality of education and facilities greatly differ depending on which college you are in at Boston University. Good mix of small and large classes but the head administration is poor at handling situations and communicating with the student body.
Freshman,4,Professors were both kind and accommodating to time differences. Many professors also  frequently asked students for feedback on how to improve the online learning experience.
Senior,4,"Such a great school and such a great city. Love going to a college with an urban campus because it never gets boring. There are always fun things to do on the weekends and you're so close to other cool places too like NYC and vermont. Classes are interesting and not as difficult as people think. While we don't have a football team, my friends and I often went to Harvard or BC for football games. So many other colleges in the area that it feels like everyone is 18-22. Highly recommend"
Junior,4,Greek life isn’t overwhelming. There’s tons to do in Boston. Student Activity’s Org puts on great events.
Junior,4,"I enjoy how office hours are very accessible. Learning remotely surely isn’t ideal, but being able to get help is great."
Senior,4,"Some classes are better than others, lectures are ok. But labs don’t work online, neither do art or music classes. It also depends on the professor"
Senior,4,Love the atmosphere but the bus and internet could run better. Financial aid is extremely helpful and do all they can. The housing department is a mess.
Sophomore,4,Classes were online due to the COVID-19 pandemic but it was mostly seamless and did not interfere with my education.
Freshman,4,The only problem with the school is the price other than that I love it. It is a very diverse school and the academics are challenging but rewarding. Being in the city of Boston is very nice too. The sports seen is super fun especially if you like hockey.
Freshman,4,The professors are very open to questions. The students are very friendly. The staff genuinely care for students.
Niche User,4,It is awesome and I love it here and is excited to attend in the fall. I love the dorms and the scenery in the area
Junior,4,"At BU, I've been able to find a smaller community within my major that supports me while navigating the experience of being part of a much larger institution."
Senior,4,"Attending Boston University has been wonderful! It is a very diverse and rigorous school. Greek life is not overly present but you can be extremely involved if you choose to do so. Also, very academically challenging!"
Alum,4,I liked Boston University's diverse atmosphere and the high caliber academics. It really pushes you ahead when you come out into the workforce. Loved the campus and the ability to meet people outside of my usual social circle.
Freshman,4,"There's a huge population so if you try to find the right group, you will find it! However, you can't just sit there waiting. That is the drawback of having such a large population at a university."
Sophomore,4,"Boston University's College of Engineering is very academically rigorous, but implements a fair grading system and has many great professors."
Freshman,4,"I was recently accepted to Boston University. I am basing this review on my experience with a summer program I did there before my senior year. I participated in the AIM creative writing program and had the best experience. I made lifelong friends in the course of three weeks, stepped outside my comfort zone, and got to explore my passion. Would highly recommend a program like this for anyone."
Freshman,4,"Classes are interesting and engaging but way too far apart. Dorms are good but food is awful. Boston overall is an amazing place, and BU gives you a chance to live right outside of a midsize historic city."
Freshman,4,"Good school, great city, But grade deflation. The diversity on campus is also cool but the freshmen housing is a joke. With the amount students pay you’d expect some air conditioning."
Sophomore,4,"BU is a very difficult school, especially in STEM. We have some of the hardest finals in the nation, not to mention grade deflation. There are many good professors, and though the classes are difficult, you will receive a great education. However, it is difficult to make friends in classes and the staff, even the advisors, are not particularly helpful. There are so many opportunities, both in the school and within the city of Boston itself, but without guidance it is very hard to know where to begin. Through my professional co-ed fraternity, I was able to get a spot in a lab, learned about different volunteer opportunities, and received guidance on choosing classes from older students. Networking, building connections, and learning to be an excellent self-advocate are essential. Otherwise it is very easy to feel lost in such a large school filled with so many other, equally talented students."
Freshman,4,Boston University is a huge school with many many opportunities. It is a little pricey but the engineering facilities are great.
Freshman,4,Campus is right in the city which is really nice. Teachers are knowledgebale and willing to help if you reach out to them.
Freshman,4,"The campus is in the heart of Boston in a very nice section. It has been updated and modernized for the 2000 ""millennials"". The dorms are guarded by a security guard and a turnstile on the way in. There is a safe in the room, microwave and refrigerator along with the usual wood desks and beds. The rooms are a decent size for a campus in the city. They have a shuttle that runs to bring you from one end to the other. There is a bike lane for those who wish to bike from class to class. For those into cross country and track there is a joggers lane that crosses  the highway and runs along the Charles River."
Sophomore,4,"Boston University is a very metropolitan university located right in the middle of Boston. The campus is not what you think of when someone mentioned campus. It doesn't have all the green space, but I think considering it is in the middle of the city, the amount of land dedicated to greenery is considerable. I really like it since I came from New York City so it was not out of my comfort zone."
Freshman,4,"It's a good school but it is pricey if you are not being offered financial aid. I wasn't a big fan of the layout of the campus (or namely the lack of campus) as it is basically just part of a single street. You are close to a lot of different places in the heart of Boston though. 

The classes can be difficult but the professors are good and the atmosphere of the campus and the student body is pretty good. The hockey team is great but there isn't a whole bunch of school spirit. 

Overall, its a good school with great resources and opportunities and I would definitely recommend it, and it should be a school that you consider."
Junior,4,"BU is what you make it. There really is something for everyone. There are a whole lot of types of people from so many different backgrounds. Sometimes that's great and others, not so much. It really depends on which school you are in to see the culture the university has. Overall, I think its pretty solid."
Niche User,4,"The only interaction I've had was a college tour, but I was very excited to see how much financial aid they give out. I loved the campus, and was happy to discover their teaching program. Can't wait to apply!"
Junior,4,"Boston University is a great school and provides students with many opportunities. I love the campus and being so near the city. The classes have been great every semester, the professors care about their students. The one thing I'd recommend BU improve is the housing, it is very hit or miss- some residences are very nice while others need improvements."
Freshman,4,"I fell in love with this school due to how engaged and motivated the students are. The abundance of diversity really contrasted from suburban Pittsburgh, and love connecting with people who have different experiences all around the globe."
Sophomore,4,"Every student is so welcoming and friendly, as soon as you arrive on campus. Staff members are proud of the university and work closely with students, but students have to make an effort in establishing that connection.
It is easy to be lost, physically and academically, in such a large institution, but the community on campus and off work to extinguish those fears.
There is a plethora of clubs and societies to join, and no organization or hobby is off limits.
BU is really a wonderful institution and a school I take pride in attending."
Junior,4,"I made every effort to transfer to BU. I love this school and the academic rigor I face every day. However, it can be a tough school to love. The food is okay and the housing situations vary semester to semester, but living in the city is a definitely plus, and there is plenty of good food and reasonably priced student apartments to be found."
Sophomore,4,My first year was an overall good experience. Good access to available resources such as professors and advisors.
Sophomore,2,Only took classes that became online due to the pandemic. CS professors didn't really do much to help while the others did. I'm rating this poor since most of my classes are CS and it annoys me how little help they gave in such a tough time
Freshman,2,"The worst thing about this school is the cost, and after a year of attending I can certainly say this was my biggest regret. It simply isn’t worth it to pay this much for a university that isn’t an Ivy League. I wasn’t a good match for this school in regards to the social life, but that can mostly be attributed to me not being a party person. The campus is oddly distributed, and the housing at least for freshman is abysmal. The grade deflation is obvious and not worth dealing with, especially if you are premed."
Freshman,2,"There were slight accommodations to the online learning, but the chem department was so mismanaged at least in my experience and opinion."
Senior,2,BU is an incredibly hard school. I think that the resources were also not as great as they could have been for such a large school with such a large endowment. Especially the premed advising. They were not helpful and as a transfer student I felt very unsupported.
Alum,2,"Some 32 years after my graduation, I can report that my BS from BU has had absolutely no impact on my life. I rarely think about my time there. The few times anyone has ever bothered to inquire about my undergraduate school (perhaps 2-3 times over the decades) I may as well have attended Whiz-Bang State. Nobody cares. Going to BU is akin to dining at, say, the Olive Garden: the menu looks slick, the commercials look tempting, but in the end its just a very average experience. The “campus” is depressing. The students back in my day were largely all the same (myself included): slightly deficient academically but able (via family money) to “pay the freight”. We were rich kids who could not access any better school. At a sticker price of nearly 300k (an absolute scandal, btw) you could attend a community college then a state university and have perhaps 200k left in your pocket. Get the picture?"
Sophomore,2,"If you can afford it and like the Boston area, then you might like BU. The University has a lot of great professors and I was surrounded by intelligent people. Regardless, I am shocked to see how well BU scores on niche. I attended up through sophomore year, and never met anyone who was thrilled about being there. The lack of campus is isolating, and you can walk from one end to the next without seeing anyone you know.

Boston University is VERY expensive, and the city of Boston is, too. I was in the worst and cheapest dorm on campus, Warren Towers, and I was paying 9k per semester. Don't expect any help from the FinAid office if you can't pay. 

On top of that, grade deflation is real for STEM classes. My freshman calc class had 90% of students getting Cs. Because of this, it is extremely hard to transfer out of BU to a comparable or better school. I sincerely wish I had never, ever attended this school. Please, don't do this to yourself.

Food is great tho"
Niche User,2,"School is ok, campus is nice but from my opinion, it doesn't worth No. 37 on USNews national ranking and 87 on Niche. In the same Boston City, Students are not working hard like Harvard, MIT, Tufts and BC students! In contrast, many of them Play very hard, absent in classes, distracted by lots of things."
Alum,2,"BU was disappointed - there was no intellectual environment like MIT, columbia or Harvard.  Just student getting through courses and graduating.  Labs are dark at night and on weekend.  Do not come here if you want to interact with intelligent  p eople"
Alum,2,"BU loves to tout their diversity, but it is mostly comprised of rich white kids from Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. There is very little school spirit, nothing in the area is affordable, and the cost of tuition is a joke. The administration clearly cares so little about the students--this is something I highly underestimated before going there.

One thing that makes BU stand out, however, is their study abroad programs. They are usually a lot cheaper than a semester at BU, and completing an internship in a foreign country has been an awesome talking point for me after graduation. I learned more while abroad than I did the rest of my time at BU, and am so grateful for that experience. My time abroad was a hundred times more enjoyable than my time at the Charles River campus."
Freshman,2,"It's pretty overpriced and the classes I've taken so far are mostly just busy work. There's not much to do on campus if you're not interested in athletics and want something more laid-back to do, and the parties are always the same. There's nothing unique about them, just overcrowded basements with terrible speakers. The best advice I could give is DO NOT APPLY TO CGS. It's nothing but busy work, and the classes are way too broad. They try to cover too much with no real structure. Professors just ramble about disjointed topics for about an hour and that's class."
College Junior,2,"Although I feel safe walking down campus at night, one step into Allston and I need to be in a group. Sexual assault issues are very real, just as any campus in the country. It's best to just watch your back and you'll probably be fine."
College Senior,2,"Being a guy, I do not even think about being sexually assaulted or harassed. However, I have had some girl friends who have been harassed, one of them buy a professor, The school did not do anything about it, only a slap on the wrist."
College Senior,2,I am not in Greek life nor am I interested in it. Fraternities and sororities do not seem to do anything but party. Some of my greek friends are quite intelligent and nice.
College Freshman,2,"Rooms are very small, bathrooms are not always clean. Social atmosphere is too quiet. Food downstairs is bad. And doors shake, windows shake, weird smells from dinging hall come inside the room through the window every day."
College Freshman,2,"absolutely no sense of community WHAT-SO-EVER. The university is expensive, and professors don't even teach half of the classes, T.A.'s do. I thought I liked cities until I came here, now I hate it. All the dorms are disgusting, except for StuVi and bay state. Not a lot of room for electives, only focused on research etc. Just not a good school in general, VERY easy to get lost and not have any friends."
College Freshman,2,"From what I have heard, BU has a very bad reputation for sexual assault. However, you can also see that they are trying to improve the conditions with programs like SARP."
Recent Alumnus,2,Its good that there is not much Greek Life.
College Sophomore,2,"I had a really bad experience with my roommate and had to switch rooms mid semester this fall. I was in the community service house and for the three months I lived there, we did no community service projects. We also never did activities as a house."
College Freshman,2,"Dorms are old and in general need of repair. Any newer dorms or apartment style dorms are very expensive compared to the already expensive old dorms. Real estate in Boston is expensive, so that is expected, but dorms are generally sub par compared to other universities."
College Freshman,2,"I really don't think that I made the right choice for me, but it's a good school."
College Senior,2,"Compared to other large schools, BU's party scene is pretty small. You usually have to know someone to get in, or to even find out where they are."
College Senior,2,"School spirit doesn't really exist at BU. You won't see many people walking around in BU sweatshirts or other gear because BU students treat life like a fashion show. We don't have a football team and aren't really known for anything other than hockey, so attendance at sporting events tends to be low. The hockey games are great, though!"
College Senior,2,"I've made a lot of good friends at BU, and I enjoy the majority of my classes, but there are some serious problems at BU. The administration is terrible and doesn't care about the students. They are absolutely horrible about giving adequate financial aid, despite tuition rising $3,000 every year (they don't freeze your tuition). While the professors are very knowledgable and would be happy to answer any questions, a lot of them are clearly more concerned with their research than with their classes. We also have the hardest grading system in the country. Housing is insanely expensive and the meal plan costs $5,000. If you're not from an elite family, you will likely feel very out of your element here. I know many people who wanted to transfer but suffered through to get a good degree like I did. I wouldn't recommend BU to anyone."
College Senior,2,Forced upon freshmen students and incredibly expensive without offering a close social environment
College Sophomore,2,Dorms are extremely small without many common spaces; disappointing for the amount charged. Grades don't help you with the housing lottery which is disappointing.
College Sophomore,2,"Boston University has no sense of community and the student body is not engaged within the community. When you come here you are here to be in the city Boston, not the university. It feels like a commuter school and the cost of living is expensive. Some of the facilities are horrible even though BU has one of the highest tuitions in the nation. The teachers and academic advisors are great and very helpful but overall the school has proven to be the wrong fit for me."
College Freshman,2,"I was very excited to come to BU, and gave up many better academic schools to go here because I thought I would like it, but I really hate it. I plan on finishing out my year here, and then transferring. Many people really like it here, but I thought it was going to be my dream school, and I would be in love, but sadly that didn't happen."
College Sophomore,2,Not a fan and you have to go elsewhere to find a party
College Junior,2,"First off, the Financial Aid Office's customer service is great. Always remember they mean well and want to help, even when the numbers are higher than you expected. They will almost always waive the late fee, as long as you're communicating. They understand our pain as students because they all were there. My 2 star rating is not intended for them!

But really, it's just stingy BU. They don't award much money, especially if your parents filed a tax return extension and BU has to wait around until August for your tax information. However, that part is out of their control because money runs out. Can't argue that one, only can complain. Graduating with debt (usually more than a few thousand dollars) is just a part of the culture here. I should add that I know one or two people here on full scholarship, but this is usually merit-based rather than need-based. Unless you have the money stashed away or you won a full scholarship, you will probably run around looking for money. My real question is: why can we afford smart phones and pretty laptops but not an education?

MY ADVICE, and please take this advice: Start early!! Don't wait until you're packing for college to look for scholarships--more importantly, don't wait until you're in college. Apply to everything that comes your way. Take surveys like this one, write essays, and enter no-essay scholarship contests daily! Even, or especially, the $100-$600 contests. Just because you run into $10,000 scholarships doesn't rule out the little guys. Those may mean tens of thousands of dollars. To all high schoolers planning on attending college, those tuition bills are coming way sooner than you think, and there is SO much money out there, all you have to do is write a few short essays."
College Sophomore,2,"As a freshman, I found the parties more annoying than anything."
College Freshman,2,BU is expensive and there is no way getting around it.
College Freshman,2,"I don't like the greek population. Even though they are a small percentage, they definitely make themselves known and it sometimes feels overwhelming."
College Freshman,2,They can be a little too strict with the rules. It can be a hassle to sign someone in to visit your dorm. They're also outrageous with underage (or even if you're over 21) drinking.
College Sophomore,2,"Boston University is an extremely urban campus and for this reason definitely not for me. It's spread out campus breaks up the college feel, making it difficult for students to form a strong sense of community."
College Freshman,2,You have to basically be a genius to get a merit scholarship. I was top 5% of my 320 person class and didn't get a dime. Financial aid isn't great either. One thing you learn very quickly is that BU loves to take your money.
College Sophomore,2,It is very expensive and not at all safe.
College Freshman,2,I would say avoid living in warren it's not worth it
College Freshman,2,The guy to girl ratio is very visible on campus and the guys aren't that great.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Athletic facilities are great, and the gym is amazing. However, good luck if you would like to create a new sports team. They will not let you."
Recent Alumnus,2,I have a lot of professors who were not good at teaching.
Recent Alumnus,2,"As far as I know, cops always try to bust parties and gatherings. I have not heard of a sexual assault in campus."
College Sophomore,2,"BU is pretty stingy on financial aid in my experience. Even when I appealed my award package, they didn't give me more. Overall a pretty expensive school that I don't think is worth the price tag."
College Sophomore,2,"If you want cheap, Allston is one of your only options. If you live in Allston, it's often disgusting. On-campus is usually the safest option"
College Sophomore,2,"We have some stellar athletes at BU, but most of the student body doesnt care unless it's hockey. The attendance and enthusiasm at most games (non-hockey) is so poor it's embarrassing."
College Sophomore,2,"Although Boston is a great place to live, I found the campus vibe at BU to be sub-par. There is no school spirit or community feel at all. I don't feel like I attend a college, it's more like a degree-machine. The academics are great, but I didnt feel like I'm getting the entire ""college experience"" other schools offer"
College Sophomore,2,"I need financial aid, but my calculated family contribution is too high. I am working on getting merit scholarships."
College Junior,2,"Plenty of club and intramurals to join, but varsity isn't really praised here."
College Junior,2,"The greek life is not very well accepted by the university, therefor it doesn't play a huge role."
College Junior,2,"Off campus housing is hard to find, and the school doesn't really help with it."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life pretty much sucks. There's no housing and the process is terrible
College Junior,2,"Having lived all over the US, I think Boston has some of the worst housing. Many apartments are dirty, cramped, and old. I saw that were disgusting with molde and paint peeling off the walls and the landlord was saying how these were not even the worst units he had seen. You can find a nice place you just have to hunt for it and have a strong stomach while doing it. I don't think the rents are terrible. I've lived in places with higher rents overall, you might have to commute a little ays but the T is very easy to use."
College Sophomore,2,BU is a private school and as such is very pricey. It's hard to find the money you need.
Recent Alumnus,2,There are too many girls and not enough guys and the guys who are here are usually interested in guys.
College Junior,2,Almost no one goes to sports games. My school lacks spirit complexity
College Freshman,2,"Its Boston. The weather is bipolar and you will experience ALL types of weather within a year of being here. Bring a variety of clothes, jackets, and shoes in order to be prepared and leave the umbrella at home. The wind blows in all directions here."
College Freshman,2,"Not gonna lie, the campus is strict when it comes to vistors, noise violations, and drinking/drugs. But depending on where you live you can get around those issues easily."
College Freshman,2,"Drugs and alcohol are not hard to find at BU because it is college afterall. Kids wanna party but it is by no means forced upon you. If wanna drink that's fine, if not thats fine too."
College Freshman,2,"Not gonna lie, Allston is a sketchy area at night so crime on campus usually occurs on the west side of campus. Also the police is present but usually to bust parties."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The drug scene at Boston University is very visible. Many students find a way to sneak alcohol into student dormitories even though it is illegal. There are no bag checks other than metal detectors meaning that basically any type of drug can enter and leave the buildings. Many students take part in drug usage, especially alcohol and marijuana and these are used mainly due to peer pressure. However visible the drug scene is at this university, I believe it is definitely not the as bad as other schools I have visited."
College Freshman,2,Wifi will suddenly die on you even if you're just in your dorm. SUCKY!
Niche User,1,"They claim to want all their students to succeed and do so by providing financial aid. However, when it comes to applying here, they are very stingy on providing aid. I have an EFC of 0 and the aid package offered to me would have put me over $100,000 in debt after graduating. They rejected my appeal for more aid and had the audacity to send me an option for a payment plan, completely ignoring the fact that my family simply could not afford it."
College Junior,1,Way too much Greek Life
College Freshman,1,It sucks major time. The freshman dorms are horrible. There is no space and no A/C.
College Freshman,1,Dont even have a greek life. The greek life pretty much sucks.
College Freshman,1,the health center is terrible
College Freshman,1,"It is difficult to determine the level of crime on campus because barely anything is reported to students from the Boston University police. The police are essentially on campus to protect the students, and students do not get in trouble for smoking weed or violating the law because they are ""BU affiliated"". This allows BU to sweep a lot of things under the rug. Campus is generally safe even at night, but the ""safewalk"" program that takes students home between 10 pm and 2 am are other students walking with you and they are typically snarky to do so."
College Sophomore,1,"The housing system is absolutely poor.  They charge thousands of dollars and jampack multiple students in rooms only meant for one.  They take old decrepid buildings, put a BU sign on it and that's it.  No renovations or even safety measures have been made.  Very disappointed."
College Sophomore,1,"Where do I begin? From the lack of a campus to the absence of Greek life to the grade deflation, BU is holistically an utterly terrible school. If you expect to party in college, please do not come here. First off, all parties are off campus because there is no campus to party at. If you're a girl, you can get into most any party, but will have slim pickings and will soon get bored of those guys because guys literally aren't allowed into parties. Guys who aren't on sports teams or in one of the three respectable frats on campus are simply screwed. Furthermore, there is no school spirit at BU. The hockey team is the only thing we have going for us, but really, who likes hockey? There are no tailgates, no popular events, and BU's almost non-existent Greek life will surely be extinct in a few years because the administration has sold their on-campus housing, cracked down on them, and made it clear they are not welcome on campus. Because of the linear and extremely urban ""campus""of BU, the anti-social kids in East campus rarely associate and mix with the better looking, more athletic, partier types in West campus. The administration is impenetrable and cares more about its image than transparency and justice with regards to discipline and sexual harassment cases. I myself am transferring next semester, and at least half the kids I've talked to about transferring say there are only one or two characteristics about the school that account for the reasons why they are still here, whether it be money or their friends. The academics of BU are really the only positive, if you can look past rampant grade deflation and the total absence of any atmosphere that inspires one to study. Unlike most other campuses in America, BU's has no brick buildings, no ivy covered libraries, and really no place where one can feel comfortable sitting down for ten hours in the relaxing reprieve of a college campus."
College Freshman,1,They don't have many scholarships for people based on academic success.
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you love not spacious and super expensive housing, that's the place to go."
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life is dead because of the strict policy BU follows.
Recent Alumnus,1,Cops bust the parties all the time.
College Sophomore,1,I am quite upset with Boston University's Financial Aid System. I don't understand how a university with so much money has very limited options for financial aid. They don't have much money to help students attend and cover the high costs.
College Freshman,1,"It's Boston, it's expensive and not super close. Not worth it, just take advantage of the awesome brownstones and StuVi"
College Freshman,1,You either get all the money or none.
College Junior,1,No chance of international students getting any kinds of awards at all.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Academics are ""ok"" here. I say they are ""ok"" because there is A LOT of grade deflation...meaning some professors will create exams and assignments to intentionally make sure students stay in the ""B"" range...not the ""A"" range. 

But it's not like BU doesn't want you to succeed...actually that's exactly what it's like.

Work your butt off to a ""B"" and graduate with a ""B""."
College Junior,1,still trying to get more
Recent Alumnus,1,"My school continues to increase tuition and I'm still paying a lot when the semester ends and the bill comes. I don't understand why the financial aid isn't increased significantly so that students can see that the school cares about us and our education and not just the money we are paying. Tuition is very expensive and there needs to be more loans, scholarships, and help for students. I also think that the tuition should be lowered so students won't be burdened. Especially when senior year comes and all the tuition has to be paid before they can graduate/get a diploma. Too many obstacles!"
College Student,1,Winters in Boston are the worst! It was my first winter in the Northeast and I didn't like it at all.
College Freshman,1,"They tag your attendance, they will call the police if you arrive to your dorm drunk, and some RAs are out to get you"
College Freshman,1,"For its endowment, aid and scholarships through BU is absolutely pitiful"
College Freshman,1,"The cost to have a car on campus is ridiculous. If you try to use meters, you will quickly find it is a huge inconvenience to find quarters and refill the meter every 2 hours, if you can even find a spot."
College Freshman,1,"Sororities cant have houses

Frats are off campus"
College Freshman,1,"You will not find a parking spot. If by some miracle you do, you will get a ticket. Do not bring your car unless you have a place to part in an indoor lot and you are willing to pay hundreds monthly for a permit."
College Freshman,1,Don't try to drink in Warren. Don't try to come home drunk to Warren. Don't try to sneak in guests to any dorm. Don't bring your car and expect to get street parking.
College Freshman,1,The cold weather is really bad in Boston
College Student,1,barely give any aid. very expensive tuition
College Sophomore,1,The school is insanely expensive and offers grants based SOLELY on academic performance. Helloooo I am poor! I need assistance.
College Sophomore,1,I actually noticed when I saw a black person on campus. That means there are not very many here. I have seen a total of three black people.
College Sophomore,1,"There are computers in Mugar, and that's about it! I commute. I don't want to bring my laptop with me every day. But this school barely has any available computers! I tried to use the one and only computer in the Science and Engineering Library in Cummington. It can only access certain sites! The internet is extremely slow. You can't save any work on it, either! I can't make it to Mugar every time I need to print something or use the internet."
College Freshman,1,You can't have a visitor for more than 3 nights and it is a very strict process.
College Freshman,1,"There is pretty much no parking on campus. BU is a city, and supposedly you can get everywhere with public transportation."
College Freshman,1,"The greek life here is pretty poor. When I was coming to school I thought it would be good for there not to be much greek life, but I was wrong. There are no parties here and the rare greek parties, when they occur, are quite lame and usually are guys looking for scantily dressed girls."
College Freshman,1,They are not the best at giving out scholarships.
College Sophomore,1,"For many reasons, having a car on-campus will be inconvenient. Unless you're from the Boston area and/or somewhere close by you'll realize that the parking pass is expensive, parking takes too much time and that opting for the shuttle (campus bus) or taking public transportation saves you time and money."
College Sophomore,1,"The Greek life seems more focused on parties than actually being involved with local events, charity, building a bond with your sisters/brothers etc..."
College Junior,1,"The nightlife at BU sucks.  If you're underage, the only thing you can do is party in your dorm room (whooo..........) and risk getting written up or go to an absolutely filthy frat house that is a cesspool of germs.  Even with the frat houses there are certain stipulations.  If you want to bring your guy friends, forget it.  Unless you have a 6:1 girl/guy ratio.  If you're not attractive, forget it.  If you don't know a brother, forget it.  The frat houses themselves are in a pretty sketchy area of Boston (Allston) and I don't recommend walking around alone at night if you're a girl."
College Sophomore,1,Do not bring a car with you to campus. You're going to be paying overpriced parking permit costs or getting lucky to find an open space on the street. And if there's a snow storm and the streets get blocked...it's hopeless.
College Sophomore,1,"Despite not even having a car, I have still run into issues with parking when relatives have come to visit. Parking in East Campus during baseball season is a nightmare, and we have only narrowly avoided having to pay to use the school's own parking lot as visitors. I feel bad for the people who have cars on campus, as there seems to be limited parking throughout the rest of the year as well. Boston is not a car-friendly city."
College Junior,1,90% of the school year it is about 30 degrees and perhaps snowing. The spring is beautiful though. Just invest in some snow boots.
College Junior,1,You have to pay out of your behind for a set parking spot. Street parking is hard to come by.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking in general is very difficult in Boston, so don't plan on bringing a car on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"strict RAs, visitation rules, security guards are asses"
College Junior,1,"The weather in Boston is very confusing because it might be sunny in the morning and raining later in the afternoon.  During the transition from fall to winter, you never know how to dress because it may be freezing outside, but the rooms are extremely warm.  We also have some pretty bad wind tunnels, which are worse than the cold.  And although we get a lot of snow,   classes are usually never cancelled."
College Senior,1,"Finance program at SMG is lacking.  Only four core courses (Capital Markets, Corporate Finance, Portfolio Investments, and one elective course).  BU is a non-target school for finance which makes it difficult to land banking jobs unless you have a substantial network of contacts built up"
College Sophomore,1,"Boston University is very very strict.  We have security at our dorms, making sure you're a student before we can enter. There's a guest policy where we to sign the guest in which is a hassle going in and out.  The resident assistants patrolling the floors at night are super annoying. it seems as though they want us to get in trouble."
College Sophomore,1,I didn't receive any financial aid at all. I was very disappointed because now it makes it harder for my family to send me and my two twin brothers to college.
College Senior,1,"It is very difficult to find parking unless you pay exorbitant rates for a parking spot. However, having a car on campus is completely unnecessary. It's definitely more hassle than it's worth."
College Freshman,1,"This is not the place to go if you are looking to move on from the environment of high school. The cliques and exclusive groups like the jocks and the preps gain even more people in a higher concentration at BU. If you aren't part of this crowd of people, it can often be very hard to acclimate to the school quickly. It may take a while to find your type of people and to make friends who are like you, if you don't play sports or don't plan on joining a fraternity or a sorority. But if that is your plan, you'll most likely have a great time at BU, because contrary to popular belief, these groups have a lot of presence on campus. "
College Freshman,1,"There is basically no partying done on campus. Everything takes place at the frat and athletic houses in Alston, which is definitely one of the creepier and more dangerous areas of Boston. The guys in these groups generally fit the stereotype of the arrogant and rude frat boy who is truly only searching for one thing. BU is definitely not the school to come to you if you are looking to party in the dorms or have a place to go every night of the weekend. Most of the frats won't let in large groups, make guys pay, or get shut down by the strict police system before eleven. Another problem is that even living in West campus, there is still about a mile walk to any of the action happening in Alston and there is no T stop where the parties are, so if you want to party be prepared to walk and potentially not get in anywhere. "
College Freshman,1,"The ratio of guys to girls, 40/60, makes for a negative experience when it comes to the social life on campus. The straight guys have basically the pick of any girl that they want and this leads to a very arrogant straight male population, which can be seen especially in the bad reputation of the hockey team. Another result of the ratio is a large percentage of all girls floors which often times makes the ""traditional college experience"" hard to come by. "
College Junior,1,"Everybody Hates the Greeks – Everyone at BU who is not a part of Greek life seems to look down on the Greeks quite a bit because they're idiots, they're infamous and giving our school a bad rep."
College Freshman,1,"The Only Bad Thing About the School – Unfortunately, I have to pay a lot to come here. It IS worth it, but it is also a lot of money. I received very little aid, and scholarships were given out weirdly. I know some kids who received them and some who didn't, but their academic and background are almost the same. I wish I had received more money....

The office will try to help you find a job, but you should go search on your own."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't Bring a Car – There is no reason to bring a car to Boston University. At all. There is plenty of public transportation, you will waste all of your money on gas and parking tickets (which they are evil about) and you won't get anywhere any fast than walking or using the T."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Swift and Severe – BU has a zero tolerance policy that can make BYU look progressive.  Even in the case of making a good decision to, say, get a friend suffering alcohol poisoning an ambulance, you will get punished without any chance of appeal.  Do not bring drugs to this campus, the risk is too high. It is slightly better in the small brownstone housing, since RA's are less likely to be around, but in large dorms such as Warren Towers - people are evicted from Student Housing with alarming frequency."
College Sophomore,1,"Rain, Snow, Sun, Sun, Snow, Rain, Hail – Weather affects everyone's moods. People just don't go to class. On top of that, Boston's weather is ridiculous and goes by no schedule or logic. It can rain, snow, hail, throw 100 mph winds at you, and be 75 degrees sunny, all in one day."
College Freshman,1,Printing is terrible. You get 100 pages of free printing per semester and it is never enough as the professors like you to print things out that they post online.
College Freshman,1,It's Boston. Obviously parking will be tight. Unless you have a permit from the University it's really hard to find street parking.
College Freshman,1,"Very Strict – The police force is SO strict. There is security to get inside of every dorm. You always have to swipe in, and you always have to sign in a guest. The BU Police is located right next to West Campus, which holds the most partiers, so that's quite annoying. Drinking in dorms is not big because you will get caught, and it's pretty serious if you do."

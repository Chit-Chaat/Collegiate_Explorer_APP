Niche User,5,St. Charles Community College is a great place to learn. Very diverse and helpful college. There are many resources to help one if need be. They go out of their way to make you comfortable.
Niche User,5,I took many classes online. They were quite easy to keep up with and not too hard for being online. Canvas is great.
Sophomore,5,St. Charles Community College was great. It was a good experience for me as I was able to stay home and continue working while getting an education. Staff and professors are very nice and helpful.
Sophomore,5,"It's a traditional college experience that's a little more flexible because you don't have to live on campus. I work full time and any of the teachers I've had have been super understanding of this, which makes it so much easier and less stressful for me."
Freshman,5,"St Charles Community College is the best college in the community. It offers a wide variety of extra activities, professors, and classes."
Sophomore,5,"St. Charles Community College provides it students with an affordable, close-to-home, exceptional education. It's small and easy-to-navigate campus allows its students to flow about and easily access their classes. All of the professors genuinely want to see their students thrive and succeed, which makes them work harder. Above all, their art department is amazing. This college allows people to receive a great education close-to-home and really makes everyone feel welcomed."
Sophomore,5,"I have had an amazing experience at SCC. The advisers really want to help the students, almost all of my professors have been nothing but amazing and the website is easy to use. I've had little to no problems registering for classes and getting organized."
Sophomore,5,I love this school. Almost every professor I have had and have currently is amazing and care about their students. I have attended this school for almost 2 years and have been getting done all of my general education classes. It is close to home and the education is fantastic!
Sophomore,5,"My two years at SCC have been awesome! The staff and teachers are extremely nice and helpful. The campus itself is beautiful. My favorite part about SCC is that its easy to get involved in a club or activity. Lastly, SCC cares about its students."
Junior,5,"Great campus, good selection of night classes. The professors are very invested in the success of their students and really care about whether they do well or not. Campus at night is well lit and feels safe."
Alum,5,St. Charles Community College is less of a college and more of a family.  Each member of their staff and most of the students strives to ensure each others success.
Junior,5,The professors are excellent. I also have had great experiences with academic counselors there as well. It seems like everyone there really cares about your success.
Sophomore,5,It's a lot cheaper than a university but I don't feel like the quality is any worse. It's just not as social as your typical university.
Freshman,5,I love how you can be yourself there and no one will judge you. Everyone has such kind hearts and it's a beautiful campus.
Sophomore,5,St. Charles Community College is an excellent school that has professors that actually care who want to see you succeed. I highly recommend enrolling at St. Charles Community college.
Freshman,5,"I like SCC because I always feel safe walking from class to class, even if it's later on in the evening."
Sophomore,5,Great community college. Has lots of academic resources. The instructors really go out their way to help students succeed. They also offer many on campus activities.
Niche User,5,"St. Charles Community College is a wonderful place to start your post high school education. The Professors are passionate about their subject and often teach part time here while working at bigger four year schools. The campus is lovely, many food and study spots nearby. I would like it to be a four year school so I could go back!"
Niche User,5,"I like how the students in my OTA program all want to see each of one us succeed. We are all open in helping each other out. If someone is struggleing we all work together to help that person to understand. The professors are great, understanding, and also want to see us succeed. They go out of there way to make sure we are doing everything to be successsfull. "
Sophomore,5,"The campus is gorgeous, the professors care about your education. The best choice for someone who is looking for an easy route for college."
Sophomore,5,"One of the things I like about St.Charles Community College is the fact that it's a small campus and very affordable. There's also a lot of student clubs on campus, everything ranging from Fencing to Environmental and Global Culture clubs. A lot of the professors teach at some of the major universities in St.Louis as well as at SCC allowing students to get the same great education as they would at a four year university for a fraction of the price. "
College Senior,5,Partners with schools and helps every step of the transferring process!
College Senior,5,Relationships grow each and everyday!
College Senior,5,Have many degrees to work on.
College Senior,5,Class sizes are sometimes big but the teachers want to know everyone of you.
College Senior,5,Great school with great teachers who want to see you succeed!
College Senior,5,"Workload is normally, study hard and earn the grades!"
College Senior,5,Great school that is totally affordable! Recommended!
College Senior,5,"LOVE the online courses here. All the teachers were very responsive. More reading than you would do in class, but that is because you'll be teaching yourself. Professors set reminders that can come to your email about quizzes, assignments, etc. There is not a ton of peer-to-peer interaction but there is some on the forums. Also, submitting is easy and Canvas (where the online courses are) is very user friendly. I loved the online classes!"
College Senior,5,"This is a community college, so you most likely will not be going straight to a job. That being said, there are tons of resources available for students. They give help finding internships and jobs for both alumni and current students. There are a lot of career services offered and emphasized to the students. They are great at helping people prepare for real-world situations too, as they offer things like mock-job interviews, career fairs, etc."
College Senior,5,"I just recently chose my major, so I cannot comment on the specifics of how my major programs/classes worked, because I'll be taking them at my transfer university. I can say that there are tons of classes that you have to take for a general education (associate's degree) so you get to explore a lot of different classes. There is a lot of job/career aids, like aptitude tests, career counseling sessions, etc."
College Senior,5,"SCC is an awesome college. It is a community college, so it is small and cheap. But that is not why I love it so much. I love it because in all the classes I have taken I have had AMAZING professors who are extremely passionate about teaching. They make the material manageable and easier to understand. Also, there is a wide variety of classes offered, which helps students explore different topics, which helps because this is what helped me pick my major. Also, administration is pretty quick. I have had minimal problems with financial aid, class registration, etc. Last, they have a tutoring service called the ACE center. The tutors in there are awesome and it is free for all students. They really help you to learn the material well and are patient. The down side for some people is that there is not a social life. As a commutable school, people come, then they leave. There is not much time to talk in class among peers because the classes are only 1 hour and 15 minutes. You make friends but by no means is there a huge social scene. There are clubs, but I have not participated in any so I cannot comment on that aspect. 

I really love this school and would recommend it to anyone!!"
Recent Alumnus,5,The professors really care about the students
Recent Alumnus,5,The professors seem to really care about students
College Senior,5,"Many courses are offered with a variety of times until you progress into a more specialized field.  I found myself with very few choices on time slots for classes.  However, there was never any overlap mistakes."
College Senior,5,"Professors can be one of your greatest resources, as well as the ace center.  I feel that I came out with a large amount of knowledge each semester.  I could not have asked for anything more out of the college!"
College Senior,5,"Instructors are very helpful, making classes very easy because of the open communication with professors.  The  counselors are not the brightest so be prepared and know what classes to take.  The library staff can be very useful as well for any questions you may have."
College Senior,5,The college has a great reputation and most of the professors that work there also work at major universities in the area. So you're getting the same education for a much more affordable price!
College Senior,5,I am in the Occupational Therapy Assistant program and my teacher will email us different job opportunities upon graduation!
College Senior,5,online availability is wonderful for access
College Freshman,5,I have been able to witness a great foreign student program that is very helpful to the kids from other countries and that have a hard time speaking english. This program gets these kids involved in all kinds of things to help them adjust and learn.
College Freshman,5,I could not ask for a better school situation where I am saving money instead of taking out student loans and getting into debt. Each credit hour is worth $100 so we are definitely getting our moneys worth at St Charles Community College.
College Student,5,"One of the main reasons I picked SCCC for my college education was their flexibility. I'm a single, full time working mother so with their flexible day, evening, online,  and even weekend courses I have been able to further my education and still maintain my responsibilities as a mother."
College Student,5,"The student body is very diverse. I have had classes with students of different ethnic and religious backgrounds. My first day on campus i could tell there was a great difference in the students ages. While walking to my first class I walked past people fresh out of high school, people in their 30,s, and I even walked past a nice couple in their 70's who were walkiing hand in hand to there first class. It made me feel more comfortable being in my late 20's going back to school."
College Sophomore,5,I recommend the concerts at the end of each semester and the student recitals. Lots of amazing talent on campus. I have made lots of friends and even a few lofty connections through this school.
College Sophomore,5,I made lots of good connections and learned a lot.
College Sophomore,5,They will focus the schedule around your needs.
College Junior,5,There is a variety of students here including ethnicity and personality. This school welcomes everyone which is great because it makes people feel welcome here. Students can break out into a religious assemblies when they feel like it or not. When walking through the campus there are many activities going on. Whether its a small game of football or people exercising. This school even provides transportation for special education students and also provides education  to them as well.
College Junior,5,"I haven't attended any other colleges but this college is definitely an upgrade from my high school. Where the arts weren't really appreciated during high school, they definitely appreciated at St. Charles Community College. Every subject is in support of another. The art's facility is very open and the ceilings are high which is important for an art building with all the chemicals being sprayed. The social scene seems great. I met a lot of friends during these months. All the facilities do what they are supposed to in efficient manners. Unique opportunities include studying abroad, viewing art exhibits, there are career shows where you can meet with people who work in fields you are interested in."
College Junior,5,"I'm not very interested in athletic activities but a few of my friends are and they've said very positive things about the gym. I have ventured into the gym during my college tour  and the gym is large and they have an exercising room with a variety of equipment. There is also a building on campus where students can go to relax and hang with peers. Inside this room there is a pool table, computers, a t.v. cabled with direct tv and many sofas to go along with it. This room is a great addition to the college where students can go to unwind from the stress. The library is a very large two leveled building with many books located on the first and second floor. On the first floor there are many computers for the students to use to their desire and on the other side of the building is a room with a flat screen tv and many comfy sofas and chairs. A very good place for reading too. Upstairs is a large room where all the books for research are located and there are plenty of them. It is always extremely quiet in this room so its great for studying. There is large cafeteria with a large variety of food. The only downside is the food is overpriced. There is also a cafe located at the opposite end of the campus which offers a good assortment of food but less of what the cafeteria offers. Its a good place to go if you want less of a crowd and a more quiet lunch."
College Junior,5,"The teachers clearly enjoy what they are teaching, which is what you want out of a teacher. It makes the learning experience much more enjoyable. The teachers don't overload you with homework and the homework they give is very important to the subjects you are learning. The homework topics go much more into depth to cover the subjects you didn't have time to go over in class. The registration process is rather easy since it can be done online but one has to register very early since classes fill up rather quickly. One can even go make an appointment for registration with a counselor if they don't like the online registration option. There are special study options such as studying abroad in England, Canterbury, and much more. There are many clubs that one can join where good opportunities are provided.  "
College Junior,5,"I am currently enrolled in the Associates of Arts program. I do not know about the other majors such as science or theater, but the Art program is great. Instead of just completing randomly assigned art programs during high school, in these art college classes the teachers help you learn the fundamentals that are very necessary for anyone in the art field.One certain teacher will even come help you with your art during the early morning hours. There isn't much homework because the teachers assign you with about one project per semester. The teachers' goals are not to bombard you with work but to actually make you improve, which I can clearly say I have. There is a separate building for the arts and inside this building its very open and there are many rooms for different aspects of art such as a sculpture room, art studios, painting rooms, and many more. I'm not sure if there is any internship oppurtunities."
College Junior,5,"There are resources for everything at this school. It's great, tutors, library, library online, counselors, and teachers are willing to help as well."
College Senior,5,"I chose this school because it was a good transition between high school and a university. Little did I know that it would play a huge role in my life later on. They staff and professors are great, I have had no real issues with anything, and as far as transferring Jackie Geiser does a great job with helping me with Lindenwood."
College Senior,5,"Saint Charles Community College is a great school. I am so glad I have the experience of attending. It is a great transition from high school to a university! The professors are great! The student activities are great! The school has many clubs,  some of which I am apart of (i.e. student ambassadors). I would choose to do school all over again but with a different approach."
College Sophomore,5,There are a lot of computer labs which make it easy and convenient to do homework and find resources.
College Freshman,5,"There are all kinds of students at scc. I have made many friends already because most of the students are outgoing and very friendly. Many share a common interest, so its easy to relate and become friends quickly."
College Junior,5,"There are many different resource centers available on campus for students who need tutoring, additional resources for class, financial aid, a study room, or even a healthy lunch."
College Junior,5,I like that theres a wall full of packets for carreer options and how and where to start them.
College Sophomore,5,"They have 100's of degree plan worksheets you can get, that help you figure out what classes you need before you can transfer to whatever four year institution you plan to attend. We also have access to a transfer advisor if necessary."
Sophomore,4,"St. Charles Community College is a great stepping point to greater things, or practicing with an associates degree. With this institution I have been so lucky to have amazing professors who want to see me succeed. The campus itself is beautiful and the library is astounding. One thing I would change about my experience was being put into classes I didn't need by advisors, they were very friendly but this was not necessary."
Sophomore,4,During the pandemic I am taking online classes and the math is not very good. It is very clear they were not ready to be online. But the science department has done an outstanding job.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, it's a good school. The teachers provide help in any way they can when you ask for it and it's a very clean environment to learn in."
Sophomore,4,Online classes really weren't terrible. I am actually enrolled in some this semester and it's not too bad so far. The teachers are new to this as well so it's a learning experience to us both since COVID.
Sophomore,4,The school is a wonderful place to start off your education and your future. The teacher pushed me to do the best I could and would reach out to make sure I was getting the individual help I needed. The financial part of going to this school is wonderful you can use A+ to go to school for little to nothing. The staff genuinely cares about their students and makes sure everyone has the best opportunity to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"It was a good way to get my geneds out of the way. Most of my professors were great, but the academic and financial advisors were not helpful at all"
Freshman,4,"So far so good, everyone in the office is really nice. The clubs and organizations should be more active and out there. Technology is fairly easy to understand, too."
Freshman,4,"For someone who didn't have an idea what they wanted to do, St. Charles Community College is the perfect school to start with. I have taken classes both online and on campus and have enjoyed figuring out things I enjoy furthering my future in. I may change the availability of offering a few more night classes for those who work in the daytime although it is a very minor thing."
Sophomore,4,"Navigating their website is a little clunky, but that seems to be because they're transitioning to a new system for the students. So far, from that staff, I've gotten amazing communication and it has been really easy to work with them."
Freshman,4,I love how the campus is open and nearby. You have so many businesses near that you can do and check out. The school overall is amazing and so are the professors. The campus is pretty and studying by the pond is amazing and peaceful.
Sophomore,4,"At first, you may feel like you're missing out on the ""college/university experience"" but if you're here to really learn, it's right for you. The professors here are very well qualified in their professional and educational fields and more than qualified to answer just about any question you may have. Are they all perfect? Probably not. But from my experience, the professors go out of their way to form personal relationships with each student that enters their class."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed the atmosphere of the college and the level of the academics. The online classes, of which I took many, were accessible and easy to comprehend."
Freshman,4,"SCC is great for when you have no idea what you want to do in life. They have good gen ed courses but their admissions office is horrible. They are rude and don’t care about the students at all. Also, the math is really hard. It’s known to be harder than some universities so be careful there"
Graduate Student,4,The teachers were great. The campus was close to home and simple to commute.  The only real complaint I have is their online system is constantly changing and no matter the changes its always such a pain to navigate.
Freshman,4,I honestly really like it here and there's a huge variety of people here so there's no peer pressure on anyone even non traditional students.
Graduate Student,4,"If you're looking for a college to save money and focus on studies, this is the right school. It's a good college to start at, if you aren't sure what you want to do in the future. However, if you're looking to make friends and be involved in the school, this isn't the school for you."
Sophomore,4,"We all know that college can be extremely stressful. From budgeting to time management and beyond. What I love about STCC is that it's flexible and affordable. It's a great place to learn and rather you're looking for a career change or to jump-start your bachelor's degree, the opportunities are endless!"
Freshman,4,The professors care about your success. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The campus is safe with the on site police station.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed my time at Saint Charles Community College. It is an excellent place to begin your secondary education, because the instructors are committed to teaching the material and making sure each student thoroughly understands it, rather than publishing research or textbooks. The math courses were challenging but they prepared me for the upper-division classes in electrical engineering at my graduating university."
Sophomore,4,It was honestly a good place. I got to meet alot of interesting people and I really got the chance to apply myself and work hard for something.
Alum,4,"What I like about St. Charles Community College is that it is very affordable and open to everyone. Something I would like to see change, is more opportunities to make friends there, such as more extracurricular activities."
Junior,4,"I really do love how clean and nice the campus is. Its very large and you do have to walk a lot of if you take a variety of classes. Though, the food is a bit expensive and its better to just bring it. They sometimes have good stuff, but after a while its about the same."
Sophomore,4,"Some of the financial front desk ladies are very rude. But the school is great. Simple, good teachers, good price, easy online system. Nice campus, feels safe. Parking is crowded, be prepared to do some walking. Food is high!"
Freshman,4,"Overall, I feel like the professors truly care about their students. They make sure their students are understanding the material and getting the highest grades as possible. My fellow classmates are also very friendly and helpful to each other. I'm very glad I chose to start my education off here."
Freshman,4,I had a great experience at St. Charles Community College! What I appreciated about St. Charles Community College is how the educators are willing to go out of their way to help their students! While I was in my English class my Teacher Mr. Sippie was always available for questions. He made sure he was available on nights and weekends when he knew we would be working on our assignments. What I would change about St. Charles Community College is to try and get the students to give back and be more involved with their local community. I would like to see donations bins for Salvation army or other local charities. I also think it would be great if they could get involved with the homeless shelters or the boys and girl programs! I think if St. Charles Community College could find a way for their students to get involved yearly it would make a difference for not only the community but it could help their current students grow and learn from each individual experience they have.
Sophomore,4,St. Charles community college is a very affordable yet great college to attend. The professors are all understanding and are very open. There are many clubs and after school activities to attend.
Sophomore,4,"Pretty decent Community College, class sizes are about those of high school. Not much activity on campus. It's a strong commuter school so people show up, go to class, leave and that is about it. For the price though you can't really beat it."
Freshman,4,"I transferred from a private, college prepatory school and  was not necessarily looking forward to going to a community college. When coming from a private school, everyone usually goes to universities because they come from a background of money or they just were very good at school. I was really jealous of how my friends were going to experience the whole ""college university feel."" But within a few weeks, I started enjoying the feel of a community college. The classes sizes vary but usually are around 30 like high school. My professors are very nice and work with you which is helpful if you need that little one on one time. It is very independent as college should be so it does give you that responsibility as any college should. Best part is, it's cheap especially if you are in the A+ program or are on a scholarship. This college is very well put together and there are no negatives I can say about it. Go in with a positive outlook because you won't be disappointed."
Sophomore,4,"Alot of great help with academics, both by teachers and on campus free tutoring. The academic advisors are all very helpful as are the financial aid staff."
Senior,4,"The people in the advisory office are very helpful and friendly. The overall campus is kept very clean and beautiful. The teachers are great and classes are pretty fun. However, some of my recent experience at the college has some brick walls but most of them were fixed fast but the great people who work in the administration building. The technology and library are great buildings with a lot of resources for students to use. The ACE center is great place for help."
Junior,4,Most of thee professors have developed effective courses that significantly help their students learn the material in an effective way. Although some professors need their class set-up evaluated and re-worked.
College Senior,4,"I have had a couple teachers that I want fone of but otherwise have had pretty good teachers. The courses are designed for success and give you information you may need. Class sizea in my experience have ranged from 7-30, so classes are fairly small."
College Senior,4,"I am going for my associates degree with no actual aim at this point. With that being said, I will be able to take my associates degree anywhere and work towards any goal of my choice.  The teachers are for the most part pleasant and I would recommend SCC to anyone looking to further their education."
College Senior,4,"SCC is a community college, so the campus life doesn't really apply herebut if you get involved with activities, there are adult of opportunities to have fun and meet new people. It is very cheap and uses A+ so that is very helpful and it is also, in my opinion, it is so much nicer than other community colleges. It has a large campus for a community college and beautiful landscape."
College Senior,4,I have found online classes to be extremely helpful in my college career. I work multiple jobs and it makes it so much easier to be able to have a class online so I can look at my assignments when its more convenient to my schedule.
College Senior,4,"St. Charles Community College, to me, is considered a great college to go to because, it is convenient. Most of the people there are locals and some have a further commute. There is a wide variety of classes, and times you can take the classes. Lastly, the cost is efficient, it is a reasonable cost but not to extreme for a student to afford."
College Senior,4,"They have a lot of places to search for internships and jobs. They also have a strong connection with alumni and offer a lot of services for alumni. I am still in this school, so I am not sure of the success rate with jobs and internships."
College Sophomore,4,They don't have many weekend classes so if that's a problem for your schedule I'd suggest looking up the class schedules online. You don't have to be registered to do it! Just go to http://scc-connection.stchas.edu
College Sophomore,4,"All of the Academic Advisors at SCC are helpful with anything you need. Including job connections, filling out resumes, even trying to figure out what career to get into."
College Sophomore,4,"The class sizes are relatively small. I'd say it's about a 30 person average. The school has a variety of courses you can take, some of them are even for people who'd rather learn from home!"
College Sophomore,4,"The class sizes are relatively small. I'd say it's about a 30 person average. The school has a variety of courses you can take, some of them are even for people who'd rather learn from home!"
College Sophomore,4,Teachers have office hours and most of them are flexible enough with their schedule that they can meet you outside of those hours too. Every student has so many things that will help them excel at this school. (Including FREE tutoring.)  As long as you try you're more than likely to get good grades.
College Sophomore,4,"I love this school. The campus is close to my house and is always really clean. The teachers are nice and helpful. If you ever need help in any classes and you don't think your teacher or peers can help, they have FREE tutoring. I would recommend this school to anyone!"
College Freshman,4,I haven't had any issues in this area
College Freshman,4,Loved being able to complete the class on my own time
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of support services.
College Senior,4,they have many classes that make it easy too work around a work schedule.
College Senior,4,i have had wonderful experiences with classes and teachers. there is only a handful of teachers that i am not fond of but overall good.
College Senior,4,"there is observations and there are many different opportunities to learn and they even have a work study program if its needed. they have job fairs, and the teachers are very helpful"
College Senior,4,i feel that it is not hard as long as you stay on top of homework. the classes are fairly easy and are helpful. there are a few classes that are tedious and i feel aren't needed or need to be changed but it is a good program overall.
College Freshman,4,"I take online classes, challenging but not difficult."
College Freshman,4,I love it. The teachers are amazing and very helpful. The enrollment process is quick and everyone is very willing to help. It is an overall great school.
Recent Alumnus,4,Lots of work. But a learning experience.
College Senior,4,Classes are usually good to schedule depending on major.
College Sophomore,4,"Great people, awesome teachers, nice environment"
College Senior,4,My overall experience of the school is that it is not expensive and close to home so that I do not have to commute too long. Also the diversity of the school is good. It was a great choice to go to SCC.
College Freshman,4,I haven't had anything go wrong since day one! Love the environment!
College Freshman,4,Love the teachers and classes! Very friendly environment!
College Freshman,4,There are many opportunities for the associates degree for nursing.
College Freshman,4,I have enjoyed my online sociology class! I've taken all of my quizzes and exams online. There is not a lot of work for this class and my teacher is very friendly and good about replying back to questions quickly.
Freshman,2,"At St. Charles Community College it is impossible to get questions answered. I had to sign up for my classes without advising because they would not take me. After I signed up for classes, I found out half way through the semester that those classes do not count towards my degree. I have wasted money on classes and the teachers are very hard to communicate with because they do not answer emails."
College Senior,2,There are no career opportunities available to students.
College Senior,2,I have never really heard or seen anything on campus about job opportunities or career fairs for my major or any majors. The employees and staff at the college don't set up a time or date for job/internships.
College Senior,2,"It sdifficult to get ahold of someone in the office for information, The staff is not always helpful."
College Student,2,"I had a really bad experience with an online music class.  None of the assignments, including the final, had any due dates. Until the week of midterms when I went to do my midterm and the due date had magically appeared and passed.  Luckily, I was able to contact the teacher and he moved the due date to the end of the month.  Also the information given in the class was far too complex.  Even my mother who was a music major didn't know what they where talking about and after talking with friends who are music teachers learned that the majority of information was not level one stuff.  This class was the first and (and probably) last online class I've ever taken and there was no peer-to-peer interaction but everything else seemed perfectly normal, I know people who take a lot of online classes and did fine.  Maybe it was just me."
College Freshman,2,"The school varies by student but for the most part.. 75% of the people here are people you wouldn't want to hang out with outside of class. It's ethnically, religiously, and sexually diverse. Everyones acceptance is different because there's no sort of unity in the students here. Everyone stays with their group or by themselves for the most part. "
College Freshman,2,"There's not much of any type of career services, an alumni network or job prospects. There's opportunities for low paying jobs for hard labor that you can sign up for here but that's about it. It's just another reminder to everyone that we can't screw up here or that's our fate."
College Freshman,2,"The only nice campus resource is the library and you usually have to race for the computers or to a desk before they are all taken. There isn't much privacy in the library but it is quiet. The athletic center is a joke, you have to take a course just to use the crappy gym equipment and the only other thing is a small indoor basketball court that no one uses. The sports are just awful. We have mens baseball/soccer and women's soccer/softball. No one shows up to the games except for parents and boyfriends/girlfriends. The student center is the worst of them all. To talk to a counselor or just about anyone of importance will take over 30 minutes and half the time it's because the secretaries and counselors are gossiping and talking nonstop back in the offices and paying no attention to all the students that have been lined up at the desk for 20 minutes."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It seems like there is very little advertisement on the online classes. Honestly all the ones I took I found out about while trying to sign up for, say, English, and finding out that there is an online course available that meets my schedule, but if it weren't for that I wouldn't know about it. The workload was fine, no complaints about it. I don't know if there were really any unique qualities per say. One class I took was a nature writing class, and you had to blog about your experiences in a park, which was pretty cool, and creative, but other than that not a whole lot. The registration process was usually really easy depending on how you registered. Online verse in-person. Online it was simple enough. If you aren't very technically inclined, i.e. bad with computers, then you might have trouble, but other than that easy stuff. And the in-person was even easier. You can walk in put in your name wait to be called on, and go meet with someone to help you sign up for classes. No problem! The professor/student relationship was good for the most part. Easy to email the professors, and easy to set up a face-to-face meeting. The peer relationships weren't great for online classes. If you never had to meet in class you might not get the chance for many interactions. "
College Senior,2,Student centers are clean but small. Sometimes hard to find a spot to sit for lunch. Many students sit alone. Computers are often unavailable at certain peak times because there are not enough.
College Junior,2,"I am the only one that is responsible for paying for my money but it seems nearly impossible to get financial aid with them, also they do not accept private loans."
College Junior,2,"My major is a 2 year wait, so Im working on GED courses until then."
College Student,2,"I have been going to this college since fall of 2010, I have had to take Three Classes over because of the way the teacher have talk there classes, when I have made bad grade the first time and the second time I have past with ease.  I made a C in Chemistry when I have to have a b in it for Nusing. I still have two other classes I have to take over.  I also plan on taking my nursing classes at St. Charles Community, because some of my classes want transfer and I don't want to take them over."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Took Away a Scholarship Mistakenly Granted – I have A+ and I love it. That was easy and great. The adivsor told me that mmy high school gave me a $750 scholarship for books and supplies. I was like ""good deal, sounds like my high school."" Then 1 semester away from graduating, I have used $600 of the scholarship and I go to pay a technology bill or something silly and the collector tells me she needs $600 from me, very soon. So, That sucked. The office staff there is completely incompitent on a regular basis. There are like 2 good advisors and the entire student financials department has no idea whats going on."
College Senior,2,"Diverse     Average     Typical – The student body at SCC is quite average for a community college.  The ethnicity is very diversified but caucasian is the majority.  Most students attend this college because of the great location and affordability.  The student council is quite large and well manged by the students. There are many types of students, as the curriculum is of interest to many people."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Helpful – First of all, they rarley answer the phone and when they do all they tell you is to come into the office. When you go in the office to ask about scholorship information they tell you to look online instead of actually helping the students find something that will help them. I found out about the ""scholorship packet"" through another student and nothing from the financial aid dept. When it comes to distributing the PELL grant they are very timely."
College Junior,2,Ease of Disability Office – I have Cystic Fibrosis and the disability office didn't work with me at all. I couldn't get them to help me do anything. The reason this is a problem is because I am hospitalized quite often and they expect me to still be able to do everything. I thought that's why a disability office is there!?
College Sophomore,2,"It's There, but Not Really – In the consolers room there is job postings. Although there is job posts the school itself does not help to get jobs. They do have a annual job far, but within that job there lays places like McDonalds, the military and UPS."
College Junior,2,The school is very up to date but lacks the teacher to student care.
Freshman,1,I hated online classes and they're what made me transfer. Admittedly I do have ADHD and Autism so that is a large factor in my ability to complete them. I had two professors who were wonderful and helpful that I passed their classes despite the transition. One was alright but didn't communicate effectively through the online platform and the last was downright terrible. She told me not to worry about the work piling up because she'd happily give me an incomplete and then failed me instead. Then turned around and told a friend in my class that she'd given up on teaching us. There are some really fantastic teachers at SCC but there are also some truly awful ones.
Sophomore,1,"You get what you pay for, their is a reason they are ""affordable"" expect headaches with any administration especially financial aid."
College Freshman,1,The wifi never seems to work and when it does it's only for a few brief minutes. It worked somewhat well during the beginning of the semester and now it doesn't work at all. Since the computers in the library are almost always full you can't print without a line of people in front of you. I bring my own computer and even then you aren't able to print documents from your laptop to the schools printers. You have to put your files on a usb and put them on a library computer to print. 
College Freshman,1,The online courses here are a joke. Every single one is much harder than the traditional classroom version. The workload is much larger than the classroom version and the professor/student relationship isn't there. Peer to peer interaction is a joke at this school and even more so when you combine it with online courses. The tech support can't really help you with anything unless you come to the campus which defeats the purpose of online courses.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I suppose that the tuition is fair for the knowledge I've accumulated. However, the financial aid office is definitely the worst part of my school. They are always more than less than unhelpful. Most of the time they're rude and act like whatever they say goes, and they don't have to answer to anyone. On top of that they always take you through the ring around. They'll send you to one office stating that that's were you you need to go to get that information, only to arrive at that office, and they state that that's a question for the financial aid office. The financial aid office doesn't seem to know where their job responsibilities begin or end, and when they finally know where their jurisdiction is, they still don't know how to work they're system, and solve problems. "
College Senior,1,"Filling out the FAFSA was the easy part, dealing with the people in the administration office was a joke. The wanted all kinds of paper work,which is fine but i filled in out and turned it in three times. The lady in the office was telling me that I needed to fill out a certain section that I did not need too and clearly stated that I did not need too. I feel like if the staff in the office was better, this process wouldnt be so difficult."
College Sophomore,1,"I hate to be the only negative one on here, but I hate this place. I'm a sophomore, 3.7 gpa, early high school grad. I went here, like everyone else, to save money. Worst decision ever! I've only talked to probably three people in my two years who have been nice.Its just like high school all over again in the way that it seems like everyone is ""forced"" to go and doesn't want to be there. I also often feel left out because Im not pregnant, already a mother or complaining about my husband. I've had a handful of good professors, but a lot are vain, self centered, like to mess around and waste time. Not to mention the staff is AWFUL. There can be ten people ""working"" but there's only one person available to help you. The rest are gossiping and slacking off. The bookstore staff is also a bunch of rude elderly women. I feel like my expectations aren't high, but this place is just a bunch of bullshit."
College Sophomore,1,Student Interaction – The thing that I hate the most at St. Charles Community College is that no one interacts with eachother.  There are little events held at St. Charles Community College that are worth going to.
College Sophomore,1,"Rigidtration Is Awful – For the summer semester, SCC decided to have new incoming fresmn register at the same time existing students register.  Bad idea.  System crashed and was not able to get online to register.  We also had to register for fall classes at the same time.  Bummer"
College Junior,1,I took one class online and the teacher had problems with the network more then the students. It was a waste.

Senior,5,"Amazing! Would highly recommend. It has prepared me for the real world and how to be open-minded, analytical and has brought me many new perspectives academically."
Senior,5,"Amazing Liberal Arts experience, wonderful sense of community, great people, awesome & supportive faculty/profs! So grateful for my time at Gustavus so far. It will be forever cherished. So many campus orgs to be apart of and such friendly people!"
Senior,5,"Transferred here from another MIAC school and have never looked back. The campus sits on a hill over a river valley and is just beautiful. There's also an arboretum! The faculty and staff are phenomenal and, in my major (Geography), well known in their fields. Everyday I feel lucky to be part of this inclusive community. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
Senior,5,"After experiencing online learning for the first time for only a few months, I would say that Gustavus professors handled the change very well. I felt that I was getting roughly the same amount of information and help from my classes and professors as when we did in person classes."
Sophomore,5,"For me, I love the smaller class sizes and I love being on a smaller campus. I also love that I can pursue multiple passions, as I am a biology major that is involved in choir, swimming, and track. Overall, Gustavus has always had a welcoming atmosphere and it has felt like home."
Sophomore,5,I really love Gustavus it is a nice small town experience where you are able to form relationships with peers and professors which will last a lifetime. These professors and advisors care about their students and set them on a path for success. In the real world GUSTAVUS has a great name where alumni are always willing to help out a fellow Gustie. This school is all about their culture which is wonderful. They do a good job of reaching out to different ethnicities but I believe they can improve with this.
Alum,5,"Gustavus is a special place. While not everyone is going to get a long, and it has work to do with diversity, I am positive everyone looking for a supportive community will be able to find it. The memories you make with that community on a close-knit campus will bind you together for life. Once you graduate, you’ll always want to go back, and it never stops feeling like home."
Freshman,5,"Gustavus has a community unlike any other. The students are all connected, and we feel like a family. Everyone is welcome, included, and can find their place in our numerous organizations on campus. The food is good, and the dorms are too. The academics are strong, and the professors and staff truly care about you. The only thing I would change is cheaper tuition and more diversity."
Sophomore,5,"Gustavus was absolutely the perfect fit for me. The moment I stepped onto  campus, I knew that I was home. The community of Gustavus is what shines out the most, as well as the personalized interactions with faculty, and small class sizes. You can't go walking between buildings without recognizing someone, and asking about their day. The professors push you hard, and more than anything want you to succeed. There's a wide variety of interests on campus, and there is something for everyone, without it being clique-y. Gustavus was the perfect choice for me, and I couldn't be happier."
Senior,5,"Gustavus has been absolutely the right fit for me. The small class sizes, relationships I've built with professors, and the musical opportunities have all been integral to my college experience."
Works Here,5,Welcoming community full of fun and active people.  I love working here and discovering new things every day!
Works Here,5,A liberal arts college committed to positive change for folks of all backgrounds. Proud to work for Gustavus and proud of the values the college is grounded in.
Works Here,5,I love Gustavus! It is an awesome community and my home away from home. The professors have really helped me choose the right path and I have always felt support here on campus!
Freshman,5,I absolutely love the campus! The professors and other colleagues are so friendly and they all helped make the transition to college so much easier!
Freshman,5,"I love gustavus because of how inclusive it is! There is always something to do on campus, whether that is scheduled activities or using outdoor equipment to get outside."
Alum,5,A truly great school that prepares you for a constantly changing job market when you get out of college. Many students have job offers before graduation.
Freshman,5,Gustavus is a place where you can truly grow in your understanding of different topics and explore different opportunities if you're not really sure which direction you want to go in life. The professors help teach you how to think for yourself and not just what you should think.
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is super kind and all driven to learn something, whether about actual school work or about themselves and the communities around us."
Sophomore,5,My first semester was really tough for me coming out of state but the community there is very welcoming and helpful. Academics are really important to the school and the students there. I really felt challenged but did not struggle at all. The campus is beautiful and the college experience is one of a kind.
Sophomore,5,"Gustavus is a very school college. That’s a great advantage because you get to form a family. Everyone is super supportive literally. You’ll never feel like you’re alone at all. The professors are amazing , food is also good."
Niche User,5,"At first I didn't want to consider Gustavus, but my mom pushed me to and I am so glad she did. I applied and interviewed for several scholarships, and ended up getting them all.  Gustavus far surpassed any other aid I received from other schools. They also have a great academics program I have heard. I had the opportunity to sit in on a 3rd level Biology class, and partway through the professor came over to talk to me and ask if I was ok and why I wasn't participating. I told her I was visiting and just watching. Also when I visited campus, I ate lunch and it was really good. I have decided to attend next year."
Sophomore,5,I feel very at home here and although it's a private college with limited programs it's good quality learning.
Niche User,5,"I went on a visit my senior year of high school and had a great time. I got to see a soccer game, had an overnight visit with the soccer team, meet a professor, ate at the cafeteria and was introduced to other students. Everyone that I meet there was very nice and kind which was good to see. I also liked the environment I felt on my visit. This is definitely my first choice of college to go to."
Freshman,5,"As an international student, I was really nervous to come to Gustavus but the people on campus took away my fear and I felt home after a few days. The academic level is really good and the professors help you if you need help even outside the classroom."
Junior,5,"I love how I am able to become involved in a variety of things across campus including sports, sorority, volunteering, organizations, and work/internship opportunities. I have enjoyed how the campus is smaller so that we are able to meet others and walking throughout campus and being able to say hi to many people is very refreshing."
Niche User,5,"I have only visited the campus once, but it was very lovely. It seemed to be a very good fit for me, although I would like to see more diversity."
Freshman,5,"Gustavus is a fantastic place for an undergraduate degree.  What attracted me most to the school was the strong community and support for all students.  The professors really care your success, and they care about you as a person.  Anyone on campus will refer you to the best place of help for what you need.  The food is really good, as far as college cafeterias go.  The campus is in a nice small town, 15 minutes from Mankato and one hour from the twin cities. There are lots of parks and nature to explore nearby, like Seven Mile Creek County Park (I went there on a class field trip!).  My favorite place on campus is definitely the arboretum!"
Freshman,5,I liked my overall academic and personal growth. But I wish I was able to get more financial aid as an international student.
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Gustavus is the community and the network that people have. I am learning a lot as a student and as a person. My way of thinking is different now. I am more thinking about how I can make my life as Gustavus want us to do. But also, how can I make my life count by helping other. Professors and classmates are really nice and are always there to help. For instance, English is not my first language I struggled at the beginning of my first year. But I had all the help I needed and now Gustavus is like a second home for me. I also like about Gustavus is the Faith Community, everyone is free to practice their faith."
Niche User,5,"Right now, Gustavus Adolphus College is my top choice when it comes to picking a decision for college. The buildings are beautiful, it is located in a perfect secrete location, and it feels like its very own community. My admission counselor has reached out to me, helping to make the process much easier. Everyone must live on campus for all four years, and that is something that I am enthusiastic about. It's a great school full of life and spirit."
Alum,5,"I had an absolute blast at Gustavus. I felt connected immediately through my major, football, and orientation. While at Gustavus, I switched some passions and enjoyed being in a fraternity along with being an orientation leader. I had an amazing experience and wouldn't give it up for anything! Also, food is bomb, professors are cool, and friends are a plenty!"
Senior,5,"Gustavus is an amazing place to go to college. The campus is beautiful and the buildings are lovely and up to date. The food is phenomenal and the professors are always willing to help. The class sizes tend to be small for both upper and lower levels, often between 10 to 40, usually on the smaller side. The professors are always there to help students and willing to answer questions on not only class work but also questions on majors and how said major can help you in a future career."
Sophomore,5,I like the gusty community feel. Everyone is friendly and he professors really care about their students. the party scene could be better.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the academics and the people here at gustavus! the team truly helps to make me a better person!
Senior,5,"I absolutely loved my time at Gustavus. I believe my liberal arts education prepared me to be a well rounded individual. I had exposure to many subjects and fields. 
Student life if amazing. There are so many clubs and activities to be part of. There are always fun events occurring each weekend on campus.
The faculty and staff are so supportive. I love the small class sizes. The small class sizes helped me build strong relationships with my professors. I felt comfortable going up to them and asking for help when needed. 
Lastly, the students and community at Gustavus is like no other. I have met some pretty amazing people. I love being surrounded by people who are so supportive and kind. Best time of my life."
Freshman,5,"I have had a pretty great overall experience at Gustavus. Three classes are interesting, professors are engaging, and there are a lot of great opportunities. The only thing I would say is that the people can be clique-y, but everyone can fit in somewhere."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Gustavus.  It feels like my second home and the first time I walked on campus, I knew that this was the place that I wanted to spend the next four years of my life.  One aspect of Gustavus that I am very grateful for is the liberal arts program we have here.  With this program, we get exposure to many different aspects of learning, and not just learning about the topics related to your specific major.  I am a science major and have taken english classes and religion classes, which I really enjoyed and never would have even thought of taking if I was not forced to.  Professors also expect a lot from their students, which is a good thing because it pushes us all to be better and learn as much as possible, preparing us for the future in the real world."
Sophomore,5,I love Gustavus! It's an incredible community. I love that I can get to know my professors and they understand students learning and want to help you. The friendships I have formed here will last forever and so many good memories have been made!
Freshman,5,"Wonderful community that fostered both my desire for success and my need for higher education. The diversity of the college is surprisingly vast for the lutheran/private liberal arts background, and the atmosphere is very welcoming. The professors genuinely care for their students, both as learners and as people. The campus lifestyle is thriving, with both daytime activities and nightlife- but it isn't overwhelming to those who choose not to participate. Overall, an excellent place to spend your university years!"
Freshman,5,"Fantastic 4-year liberal arts college with an incredible and tight-knit community, outstanding professors, and state-of-the-art programs and facilities that help to make you the most well-rounded student in your field of study. The campus is also indescribably beautiful and eco-friendly! They have a never-ending list of student organizations, sororities, national and international honor societies, and major/minor degree programs. 10/10 would recommend! #whyGustavus."
Niche User,5,"Gustavus Adolphus College is very beautiful, all of the facilities areamzing. The food is also very good, it reminds me of home cooked meals."
Freshman,5,"Gustavus Adolphus College is a very welcoming atmosphere. Whether someone knows you or not, you are still very likely interact with them in some way. I would love to see the Lund center remodeled and updated."
Alum,5,"Gustavus is a small community, and there is a ton of support. It has been several years since I have graduate, so I cannot attest to the current state of the college. I have many fond memories."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Gustavus! The small school provides a great community and easily accessible professors. The academics are great and there are so many opportunities for involvement in the school.
Senior,5,"College in general is a unique and exciting experience for every student, but at Gustavus I have found not just a location to live and learn, but truly a home and a family to call my own forever. Gustavus' staff, faculty, students, donors, and alums have made this a truly unforgettable experience that I am eternally grateful to have had the pleasure to enjoy. The academics are challenging, the food always delicious, and the support of classmates and colleagues has been second to none. Go Gusties!"
Niche User,5,"Gustavus is located in a small town, with a close knit atmosphere. Everyone feels welcome at the school and in the town overall. There is complete inclusion for everyone and it is a great school to consider."
Niche User,5,I love the overall atmosphere of this school. The professors and administration are extremely friendly and after visiting campus only twice I was able to recognize the staff and I felt welcomed from the first five minutes I stepped foot on campus. The faculty at Gustavus want the students to succeed and are extremely willing to help in any way they can. I am excited to be a part of their freshman class in the fall of 2018 and taking advantage of their many opportunities and activities.
Junior,5,"I love Gustavus because it is a small, close-knit community that cares deeply for not only the campus, but the rest of the world, too. At Gustavus, you feel connected - and as an introvert, that was a little overwhelming at times - to everyone. I was astounded by how updated everyone on campus was about current events, but everyone is also willing to listen to opinions that do not line up with their own, and really, I think that's what college should be about."
Alum,5,"This college is amazing. Certainly, there are little things that get under your skin a bit but all in all, you could not pick a better Liberal Arts College in the Midwest. After financial aid, the cost really is reasonable and amenities like a nationally ranked dining service makes living on campus enjoyable. Academics? They are as challenging as you want them to be. This is a place where you can make connections with professors who have graduate school or career opportunity insider information and they are willing to help you out! The staff is caring and the Administration can be so helpful in navigating your college years and planning your future. All you have to do is reach out and connect with them! 
Go to Gustavus! Your life will be changed in powerful ways."
Sophomore,5,"What really drew me to Gustavus was the welcoming community environment. I love how friendly everyone is here, and how easy it is to make connections! Every Gustie I know is very involved in the many activities campus has to offer."
Sophomore,5,"Great environment, beautiful campus, fantastic people. THE BEST. I've got several family members who graduated from this prestigious institution. Always been able to find the resources I need to be successful in the classes, and the connections you have with the professors are very helpful."
Sophomore,5,"I love attending this beautiful school. The professors are all very knowledgeable and willing to work with any student. The academics are tough, but any student who puts their minds to it can truly succeed."
College Sophomore,5,"Prices wise, this place is amazing - even for an international student like myself!"
College Junior,5,"I chose Gustavus in part for its small class sizes, and I was not disappointed. Professors engage with students and encourage every student to participate in daily classroom discussions. Professors challenge students to think for themselves and to go beyond the surface of the material presented."
College Junior,5,"The small classes at Gustavus allow every student to engage in classroom discussions and helps professors get to know even the quietest of students. I feel completely at home at Gustavus, and I have been challenged academically without being pushed beyond my limits."
College Freshman,5,i have loved my first year at Gustavus and can't wait for the next years!!
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus, Everything is close, but if you wanted to escape from people you can. The Arb is great!! Everyone is friendly at Gustavus and many greet you or hold the door for you. Love GAC!!"
College Freshman,5,I feel safe on campus. There is safe rides you can take during late nights.
College Freshman,5,"Gustavus has a great network, you just need to get yourself into it. Networking is key to a successful career."
College Freshman,5,Huge variety of students everyone has a niche they belong to.
Senior,4,Learning online just isn't my preference. There's a reason the classes here are so wonderful in person.
Junior,4,"I took online classes as the previous semester was turned over to an online platform due to the covid pandemic, and I felt that it went very well."
Senior,4,"Great people and great community. Sometimes there can be a disconnect between administration and students, but they try to alleviate that. Incredible profs who care about learning. Lots of opportunities for outside engagement with student organizations."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I have really enjoyed my experience at GAC. The friendships I've made transcend the poor party scene and surrounding town. While there is relatively little to do on the weekends, the community at GAC is what makes this college special. When people truly take the three crowns to heart, dramatic self-improvement occurs that betters the community as well. Although I wish the academics were a bit better, as some professors run a poor class, I have no reason to believe that attending another university would rectify this desire."
Senior,4,"Gustavus has a generally welcoming feeling among staff and students. I would like to see some change in the way that administration handles certain situations, and more help with information about financial aid and loans."
Sophomore,4,"Due to Covid-19, finishing the semester online was not ideal, but I could tell that my professors were trying their best to make everything still engaging and make sure things were still running smoothly. Each of my classes was a little different. For some classes I had video lectures to watch, in others we had live zoom meetings. However, all of my professors had check-ins or office hours on zoom that you pop into if you had questions, which was helpful. Labs were interesting, but they still had us do some online simulations and activities to follow the lab curriculum."
Junior,4,"Because of COVID, we spent the majority of spring semester online.  Professors became very lenient.  I was very impressed by how available they made themselves, even just to talk.  The majority of my professors personally reached out and encouraged us all to prioritize mental health."
Sophomore,4,"It is a small school with genuinely nice and supportive people.  Of course, it is expensive and, at times, it seems like they're grasping for every penny they can get. But the professors, from what I have experienced, are very nice but won't undermine your intelligence and give rigorous school work."
Sophomore,4,"Teachers all had their different ways of using online technology. Some chose GoogleMeet meeting every class day, others asked students to participate by posting on a discussion board, and some just expected you to do the homework and send it. Despite it being different, I think the teachers handled it well and still delivered nearly the same amount of information as regular classes."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have been happy with my time at Gustavus. Through the FYRE program, I was able to discover that research is not for me! Instead, I've turned my focus to vocal music education, where I've found the professors to be knowledgeable and committed to the individual. Although the college is expensive, they do very well to aid students in paying. I have had many life-altering experiences at Gustavus, and I'm glad I'm going there."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy Gustavus and being a gustie. My first year was not so great because the lack of diversity but I soon found my crowd. The school works very hard to make sure everyone is welcome and They are trying to make the school more diverse.
Senior,4,"Gustavus has been my home for the past four years. And like any home, it wasn't perfect but I always felt like I was loved and belonged here. This school provides students the opportunity to explore their interests and make genuine connections with their peers and professors. There is not one internship, research experience, or post-grad opportunity that I did not obtain without the help of a professor or staff member. Gustavus gives back to you what you put in and then some. As I mentioned, not everything is perfect and I am well aware of that. But I am proud to be at an institution that consistently asks what it can do to be better, and then goes a step further to make action plans to incite progress that was talked about. I wouldn't trade the experience of being a Gustie for anything, it has shaped my world view and pushed me to be the best version of myself. Go Gusties!"
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love Gustavus. The campus is small and homey, it feels a lot like my hometown. One can seriously walk from one side of campus to the other in less than 15 minutes, which comes in handy when the weather is below zero on top of the hill! I oftentimes find myself calling this place 'home' as if it is. The professors and staff are so kind. If I have questions, they never fail to help me get an answer. I am so glad I chose Gustavus."
Junior,4,"I am a junior at Gustavus Adolphus College, I have liked it here for the most part. The education seems at times easier than most colleges, it can be very challenging when getting into a major that you enjoy. Like with me, I am a psychology major and math minor, I feel even more swarmed now than ever as I have studies I have to conduct and classes to take. Yet, Gustavus helps me manage this and gives me services to help my mental state."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, this school is exceptional. There is a focus on paying attention to the needs of individuals with a dedication to philanthropy engrained in Gustavus's life.  If you looking for a school that will allow for personal and intellectual development, this is the school for you. Common majors here are communications, bio, environmental science, political science, music, and history. As an art and psych major, I, unfortunately, have to knock a star for the lack of investment in the arts.  In the drawing-room, for example, the ceiling drips water (we have two pails for when it rains) and yet a brand new building worth an ungodly amount is being completed right next-door. Despite this, I still enjoy the quiet campus life and have received a large number of scholarships that have made my time in college much less conducive to stress."
Junior,4,Gustavus provides a great place to grow and learn. The professors genuinely care about seeing their students succeed.
Freshman,4,"As a first year, I can honestly say that Gustavus has become like a second home for me. Everyone is kind, thoughtful, concerned for your wellbeing and knows where to push you.  My only criticisms are that the cost is immense and for what I pay, both the music and especially art spaces are falling apart. As a fine arts major there is no way that I should have to have a bucket in the drawing room when it rains...If it were not for scholarships I would not be able to attend."
Sophomore,4,"I am a Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major, and I was an athlete during my first year. I highly valued being part of a sports team here, because it provided a great support system. However, it was too time-consuming and prevented me from reaching my full potential academically. The aspect of Gustavus that has had the greatest impact on me is the way the faculty reaches out to students. As a first-year, I was not an advocate for myself, and it would have been very easy for me to get lost in the back of the class. My professors made sure students felt comfortable enough to ask questions, and my advisor checked in with me frequently. Academically, there is space and opportunity for high-achieving students to grow, but students would do not move as quickly do not get left behind. My core complaint about Gustavus is their 4-year residential living policy. Living on campus for 4 years creates a wonderful community, but as I get older, I find myself looking for further independence."
Freshman,4,I would like to see change in the things that the college puts on for students. It is all very leftist and they love bashing the right side of politics which I lean towards. I like the facility's and athletics though they are all very nice and easy to use and the teams are very good.
Niche User,4,"Through my visits and people that I know I have learned that GAC Students are fond of their school. That being said it does not go without its flaws. It is located in a small town so the accessibility is not too great. I have heard that bringing a car is also recommended to help combat that issue. Overall, the academics are stellar and it is a very welcoming community"
Sophomore,4,What I like about GAC is the close community and the family environment that is created here. The teachers care about your performance and your well-being as well.
Senior,4,"Your experience at this school will be a product of what you put into it. As a student of color, you have to go out of your way to interact with the predominantly white population of the school because a majority of them seem to not know how to interact with people of color. If the Diversity Center didn't exist, I don't know how I would have survived socially. The Diversity Center has allowed me to find people I relate to and feel more comfortable on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Gustavus Adolphus College is a great school, where you'll be pushed to succeed in whatever you do. The school is not so big, and as a result there is a great sense of community. The professors here are good and want you to do well. It's also helpful that pretty much all the classes are small, therefore it's easier for the professor to meet any of your needs or help with any problems that you might have.  I would definitely recommend this school if you want a quality education, while being able to explore and take an array of different classes through the liberal arts program or three crowns curriculum."
Sophomore,4,"Though it does not do everything perfectly Gustavus does an excellent job at everything it does. This college provides a wide range of topics to study and classes to take,  provides a large range of ideas and has a very beautiful campus."
Sophomore,4,"Current student, small campus allows for better understanding of material and better connections with peers and professors."
Junior,4,"Gustavus Adolphus College is a 4 year residential school in Minnesota. This liberal arts college has a lot to offer through its small town and tight community.  An aspect that I really enjoy is the small class sizes, allowing for more one on one time with other students and the professors. This small, yet beautiful campus has a lot to offer as the staff and students take pride in their community as it is one that remains constant, friendly, and diverse."
Freshman,4,"It is a very close knit community, you seem to recognize almost everyone on campus.  Everyone is very friendly and nice, you never have to worry about anyone."
Alum,4,"If you're looking for a small, intimate college experience in a small town, Gustavus is a great school! The professors are fantastic and love getting to know you and helping you succeed. The food is excellent (nationally ranked) and the athletics are pretty good, too! It can get a bit cliquey since it's a small school but it's fun to recognize everyone and participate in a tight-knit community. These are people you will be friends with for a lifetime and an education that will help you achieve outstanding things -- nearly all of my friends from Gustavus have gone on to medical school, PA school, or other graduate schools!"
Freshman,4,My advisor has been extremely helpful in planning out my course at Gustavus. The professors are keen on doing the best for their students and will put forward all their effort to help us succeed. The classes show logical thinking and are defiantly not the easiest but very intellectual and relevant classes. The homework is the perfect amount of harsh yet simple which is helpful when you are working and taking classes. The next three years i am looking forward too which helps with my moral.
Freshman,4,The community at Gustavus is fantastic. The professors and students are very helpful. The whole campus is set up very well and easy to maneuver around. I love the atmosphere here and the diversity of programs that Gustavus provides is fantastic.
Freshman,4,My experience here is amazing. Everyone is really kind and open-minded. The classes are also going really well and there isn't much workload either in the classes. The only heads up that I should've got about this college is the weather during the winter. It's super windy which makes it freezing cold. But the view is beautiful in all seasons.
Freshman,4,"The entire atmosphere of gustavus is extremely welcoming and all the students I've met in my time there are kind people. There's such a variety of things to get involved in and a multitude of available places to find support. Whether the support you need is academic or personal, there's always somebody around to talk to and get help from. I've had amazing, understanding professors and the classes are challenging, but so rewarding in ways that I never expected college courses to be. I feel my academic and philosophical ideas and understandings being pushed and changed and questioned each day, changing my worldly perspective each time. Gustavus is truly a place of honest learning and acceptance."
Sophomore,4,Not the best since the hill is a big feauturr of the school and the diversity lacks but once you meet a good group of people It's all worth it.
Niche User,4,I really liked the tour of the college.  He gave me a good first impression of the college. He was very informative and the food in the dining room was great.  So much variety and friendly staff.
Senior,4,"The campus is nice. The dorms are good but aren't spectacular. The food is average and we have decent sports teams. The academics are very good and the arts are exceptional. However the Liberal atmosphere can be a little too much. People get stuck in this bubble of Gustavus. Say one wrong thing and its off with your head. Needs more chill in its life. But overall I give it 4 stars because its a great instituition but its not top of the line. Also the price tag is spendy, so you can expect some very rich and kinda 'have my cake and eat it too' type of people. But if you like all that I have described then this place is for you!"
Sophomore,4,I am a sophomore at Gustavus. So far I feel that Gustavus is a good school. It is very easy to get to know your professors and many of them want to get to know you. The only thing that I haven't enjoyed much is the feeling of living in a bubble after a while. Living on a hill makes it feel like its own tiny community.
College Sophomore,4,"This college is full of great professors and departments. Although, some are definitely better than others. The economic department is not a strong one, while the education program is very strong and structured. The classes are small which is great because you can get to know your professor easily, but it also makes it hard to find open classes as a freshman or a sophomore signing up for classes, as some fill up very quickly."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe on campus. Walking across campus at night alone is not intimidating or scary at all. On the sidewalks there are stations where if you have a problem, you can press a button and campus security will go there. The campus safety office is open 24 hours so you can call whenever. The only complaint is the way the college has been dealing with sexual assault in the past couple years. Many sexual predators on campus have gotten off with little to no punishment."
College Sophomore,4,"There are quite a few sororities and fraternities to join for such a small school. They all host many events on campus. You cannot rush until your sophomore year, which could make the decision easier to choose one if you want to join greek. Even though hazing is technically not allowed, it still happens in some of the greek groups."
College Sophomore,4,We have drug dogs last time I checked and they crack down on people that are found in possession of drugs. Alcohol consumption by underage students is normally stopped by Campus Safety Officers inspecting the buildings.
College Sophomore,4,There is no other place that has so many people ready to help it's students for their next step in life.
College Sophomore,4,"As my first year of college it was back breaking work, tireless nights of work, and fighting for what is right."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a variety of different sports on campus that involve the campus. From football to hockey to rugby and lacross there are so many different types of sport anyone can get involve in that bring the campus closer and involves students to a wide range of experiences and opportunities. A classic thing that students do is pay for equipment and raise money for their team or the charities they support, is working in the cafeteria to raise money. It shows people what happens to keep things running and what it takes to provide for the students."
College Sophomore,4,"Gustavus is a great liberal arts college that can open so many doors and experiences. One needs to know who to talk to and confide in for support with in the faculty. Time defines all and after a year at Gustavus Adolphus College I found good professors, stocked up ones, passionate professors and some that were still trying to find out their own style. Not to mention how caring and devoted is both the staff and faculty.This place wants to see everyone succeed and as long as you show respect and drive anything can happen for you here."
College Sophomore,4,"Within Minnesota this is a pretty respected college. Outside of it, not so much."
College Sophomore,4,Some professors are just bad - they didn't teach me anything and expect me to figure it all by myself. Some can be disorganized as well. But some are amazing and extremely insperational.
College Junior,4,"The workload recommended by the college is fairly easy, in my opinion. The registration process is simply, albeit frustrating for underclassmen when they log on only to discover the classes they wanted have filled."
College Junior,4,"While not a super diverse campus, I've witnessed nothing but acceptance of every minority group and encouragement of diverse perspectives through campus activities."
College Junior,4,"I've seen some underage drinking, but very few students use drugs, in fact I only met two people who used marijuana in an entire year. I went to parties, and I would be offered alcohol occasionally, put I never partook and more often than not the person offering the alcohol encouraged me to wait until I was of age before drinking. I've also had people reprimand people who offered me alcohol, even though there wasn't any pressure implied in the offer. Peer pressure regarding drugs and alcohol simply doesn't exist in my social circles. Even if drinking is popular because Gustavus is a wet campus, any pressure felt to drink is imagined by the student, not created by other students."
College Junior,4,"I have always felt completely at ease walking around campus, even alone at night. I also know that the college takes the safety of its students very seriously. While sexual assaults have occurred, the college deals with them and ttys to do what it believes is best for the victim. There are also multiple resources on campus to help students in any situation."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors at Gustavus are interested in their students and want them to be successful while challenging them at the same time. Their curriculums are established ahead of time, but are flexible to change depending on the needs of the students. Courses are very easy to register for, with students who have more credits going first. Popular areas of study include the sciences as well as majors relating to health and mathematics."
College Freshman,4,"Athletic facilities aren't the greatest, but the Gustie spirit is so strong it makes up for it. Gusts have lots of pride and love cheering on their teams. Go Gusties!!"
College Freshman,4,They want to prevent it but they know it is in use so they make sure there are resources available if something goes wrong.
College Junior,4,"Well, I mostly just use cardio machines and what not. But I've yet to hear a complaint from athletes, community members, or other students."
College Junior,4,Housing is nice I campus but the school is a four year residency.
College Junior,4,I love watching athletics on campus.
College Freshman,4,"There are a variety of courses offered at Gustavus. They are challenging, but the professors want you to do well, so they will answer any questions you have and help in any way possible. The classes are usually lecture style, with plenty of time for any questions to be asked. The class sizes are also small, especially the farther you get into your major, so there is more of a relationship with your professors."
College Freshman,4,"There are many job fairs at Gustavus, including many small and large companies from around Minnesota. Professors, alumni, the career center, and other staff/people on campus make it easy to get connected to a job."
College Freshman,4,"The athletic facilities at Gustavus are very up to date. They are always getting updated, in fact we recently got new treadmills put in. The pool, where I spend most of my time is large, clean and one of the nicest pools that I've seen around. There is a lot of student involvement in the athletics here. The swim team is one of the biggest in the conference.  The women's team is really good (we got second at conference) and the men's team is constantly improving (they got fourth at conference this year). We also have a lot of fan support. The ""Hill Crew"" has recently been established, which is our cheering section, they draw big crowds to football, basketball, and other games. The swim team also has a decent sized fan section, with our stands usually full during competitions. There is a lot of school spirit, we are all proud to be Gusties!"
College Senior,4,alumni connections are easy to make and extremely useful.
Alum,2,"A great school if you can ignore their inability to handle Title IX cases.  There were multiple cases in my major's department during my four years and the majority of them had no results.  Many people who have gone to report cases have said they were met with restraint.  Such as being asked something along the lines of ""is this really how you want to spend your time here?"""
Alum,2,"Gustavus did not provide me with a meaningful education. The professors ranged from the indifferent to the hostile, and most of the other students seemed largely interested in guzzling beer and hanging out. If you're interested in a genuine liberal arts education, look elsewhere."
Sophomore,2,"First of all, as it pertains to education Gustavus is a good school. You will be in a small class setting for most of your classes and the professors really are good for the most part. However if you are a minority or a poor student I would think twice about going to Gustavus. First af all the college has very little diversity so you will be isolated unless you are very good at assimilating. Second if you are a student that is struggling and don't have affluent parent then the ""accademic support"" people won't be of much help. Third the student life at gustavus is almost nonexistent due to budget cuts and the constant need to reduce any activities that could make the college liable. In conclusion unless you come from a wealthy family or don't mind living the next four years of your life walking going to class and your dorm... maybe the bar when you turn 21 or get a fake... you might reconsider coming to Gustavus."
College Junior,2,"yeah I don't have any networking from this school. I'm also not a Minnesota resident and don't wish to stay there, and that's really all they have for networking in general. I think they have some connects for computer science/ physics in MN but I'm not sure"
College Sophomore,2,Smell of dope in the halls.
College Sophomore,2,It is all about the money you have or your family has.
College Sophomore,2,"Again, it is who you are and what kind of money you have that gets noticed."
College Sophomore,2,The college as a whole is very snobby and cliché.
College Senior,2,not enough community involvement in our Greek life.
College Junior,2,No Greek housing available. Hazing is common during Rush week.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much variety. Near the end of the year, the students are annoyed that the same foods are served every day of the week. More variety would be really nice."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid office is a hassle, it's always impossible to get a hold of anyone that can help you"
College Junior,2,"Gustavus doesn't support living off campus so you are lucky to even be granted permission as a senior. If you do get permission however, there is a decent selection of housing nearby that is old, but relatively cheap."
College Sophomore,2,"It's very difficult to get off campus, even as a senior"
College Sophomore,2,"St. Peter is just a college town with some old people. There is not much to do, but luckily there is lots to do on campus."
College Sophomore,2,Due to my current financial situation im stuck between to wealthy for financial aid but yet to poor being able to actually pay the full tuition without attempting dozens of scholarships like this one but with no avail.
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, it's sad when I look at my financial situation. I'm paying around $20,000 a year in loans and/or out of pocket despite being an enthusiastic and bright student who had a top notch application and is involved in the 3 Crowns Curriculum. Given Gustavus is a top private liberal arts college, but I am very disappointed when it comes to the amount of aid I received. I could have gone to another college which would've been much more affordable, but it's because I feel Gustavus is worth it I've chosen to attend. Loans when I graduate are a huge worry though."
College Freshman,2,There are very few off campus houses available and they are not in the best condition.
College Senior,2,Not much outside of the classroom. The sports facilities are pretty terrible and there is not much of a party scene
College Senior,2,"Not a lot of options out there for an average, middle class male. Searching for more graduate/international scholarships"
College Junior,2,Must stay on campus at least 3 years :(
College Freshman,2,"There is not much Greek Life, and freshman can't rush."
College Sophomore,2,"Our campus strictness is just about right. It's not too strict, not too lenient!"
College Sophomore,2,"People drink. We are in college. If you choose not to drink, you are still accepted!"
College Sophomore,2,"I attend a small, liberal arts school, and therefore, we struggle in our diversity department. We could use more diversity on campus. Overall, we  spread diversity well with the amount of diversity we already have!"
College Sophomore,2,"Its great to be in my major, but it can be tough at times. It is a struggle figuring out some of the terms, but I take it in strides. The workload is a struggle, but I simply manage my time accordingly."
College Sophomore,2,"We could offer more business classes, I would like to see more marketing and management classes!"
College Sophomore,2,"Good, but very repetitive since its a small town!"
College Sophomore,2,"It's simply a small town!

"
College Sophomore,2,Only a few hundred students are let off campus each year. Because of this it is very hard to live off campus and most people live on campus in the apartments or dorms. But if you do get the opportunity to live off campus there is a good amount of housing available near campus which is really nice.
College Junior,2,"Small Town – The nightlife is what you make of it. If you want clubs and bars then you would have to drive to mankato, in which case a sober driver is needed. However, the people there are very entertaining so its not hard to lose track of time. There is free transportation on Fri and Sat nights in town but its not always the best."
College Sophomore,2,"Really Expensive Around for Single Apartment, Houses Are Cheaper to Rent! Since Saint Peter is a smaller town and it has a lot of historical value and historical buildings they are a little out dated and a little pricy. I had to get my apartment 30mins away to be able to afford it."
College Freshman,2,"Could Be Better. Overall, not super diverse. But neither is Minnesota or the greater Midwest area."
College Sophomore,2,"It is ALWAYS windy on campus. It gets very cold in the winter, as expected, but the wind makes it worse"
College Junior,2,"I Walk and Bike. Otherwise Stranded. Everything on campus and in town is easy walking and biking distance. That's usually all I need. The College runs the Gus Bus within Saint Peter on weekend nights, which is convenient. Unless you have a car, the only long-distance transport I know of is an hour bus ride to the airport in the cities for 25 dollars. I occasionally need it for getting home when my parents can't pick me up. Convenient if you book it in advance."
College Senior,2,"Very Cold – It's very cold and VERY windy in the winter.  The winter is so long, it's sometimes hard to remember what it's like when it's not winter"
College Senior,2,Gustavus has a bus that drives around campus/town on the weekends and if called. (Costs one dollar per ride during the week). Transportation to the MSP airport is available for $22 dollars one way (round trips available). Bus service to Mankato (nearest large city) is in the process.
College Sophomore,2,"Residential Campus – Gustavus is primarily a Residential Campus, so getting permission to go off-campus is very tricky, and not always guaranteed. Also, you need to have at least 3-4 friends that share and apartment to stay in the nice student living spaces off-campus, St. Peter isn't a big enough town to support a lot of cheap apartments for only one person. The benefits of living off campus is that it is probably cheaper in the long run, but you will probably want a car sometimes because going up the hill can get tiresome. The disadvantages are that Res Life makes it hard to live off-campus, and you miss a lot of the community atmosphere GAC is known for."
College Sophomore,2,"Residential Campus – Gustavus is a residential campus, so mainly only seniors are granted off campus living. If you do get off campus, the houses are old, but a lot cheaper because of it. If a student continues to live on campus, they pay three times as much as it would cost for rent and utilities off campus."
College Senior,2,"Don't See It, Don't Care – On the average, it appears through the campus paper that there are problems with underage drinking and drugs a lot of the times. Those are just the ones getting caught as well. It is said that you cannot have alcohol but many people still do, whether of age or not. Of age is not as big of a deal. Drugs are not a constant scene but has sprouted more recently."
Sophomore,1,I have not learned anything substantial over quarantine and I bet a lot of other people haven't either.
Alum,1,"Worst value ever, attended for two years. Changed to a state school, had better professors, used the same textbooks, met much nicer people, all for 1/4 the cost. Personally I’d rather save 30k a year then have cookies once a week and crappy overpaid administrators. U of M or MSU are a way better value."
College Sophomore,1,I can't wait to get out of this school.  Avoid this college.
College Sophomore,1,The campus safety and administration overlooks certain people and groups.  Administration also makes up allegations to push certain individuals out of the school. Discrimination is huge on this campus!
College Sophomore,1,"Never choose this school again; the only care I have encountered is a care for money.  Make you life count - what a joke.  This is a college where you are just a number and they want your money.  Campus Safety is a joke too, they are definitely not there to protect you!"
College Freshman,1,This school is ridiculously expensive and I spent the first 2 weeks in the financial aid office trying to figure out a payment plan and seek further aid but they were of very little help and in the end all they could offer me were more loans. I've also heard that the aid decreases after the first year.
College Freshman,1,"Mcdonalds, Dairy Queen, Chinese, Mexican, and Dominos is pretty much the main ones we've got and other than Mcdonalds and DQ they can get pretty pricey especially for delivery"
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is something special for people who are in them, but for others, its not important. "
College Sophomore,1,"We live on a hill, therefore, the wind and the snow hits us pretty hard!"
College Junior,1,"You owe us money.  You parked in the wrong spot.  You owe us money.  You're out of caf money.  You owe us money.  You're being too loud.  You owe us money.  You can't be in this building this late.  You owe us money.  Just give us all of your money and then all of the money that everyone you know has ever had and then you can go here, but we'll still hate your guts.  And by the way, you owe us more money.  (The underage drinking is a huge problem, but they are so focused on messing with hard-working earnest students that they overlook huge amounts of drinking violations)"
College Junior,1,"Everyone there sucks.  They all wear the same clothes, they all care about the same things - they are all just vapid little bottom-feeders with little to no understanding of the world beyond campus and their parents' yacht club."
College Freshman,1,"Greek life at Gustavus is more of a social group than anything. Since there is no on-campus housing for the Greeks, they would have to find off-campus housing if they so desired. Therefore, the only things they do a volunteer projects and sponsoring social events on campus."

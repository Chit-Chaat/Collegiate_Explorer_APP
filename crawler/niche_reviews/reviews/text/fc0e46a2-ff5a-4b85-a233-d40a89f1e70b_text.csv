Alum,5,I was online for summer classes then for classes during COVID. It was a pretty smooth transition and I enjoyed it.
Sophomore,5,"Mount Vernon Nazarene University is a very welcoming campus. The community at the campus is very friendly and loving. As well, they are very helpful with financial situations and help students keep their student debt as low as they can. Since the beginning of COVID-19, they have been very communicative. The actions they have taken to protect us has been remarkable.  I love the Christian atmosphere that is Mount Vernon. They are supportive and provide many resources for the students and their education."
Sophomore,5,I like how open and accepting Mount Vernon Nazarene University is as well as how open and safe the campus is
Junior,5,"Of all the colleges and campuses I've visited and looked up, MVNU seems to be the best fit for me! I feel so welcomed there, everyone's so nice, the food's diverse and REALLY good, it's not too far away from town, they have different types of games, festivals and concerts on campus, and the best part... I get to earn the degree of my dreams WHILE growing in my faith."
Niche User,5,"Mount Vernon Nazarene has a beautiful campus and chapel. All of the professors, staff, and students there are very friendly and always willing to help those in need. When I first walked onto the campus I felt like I was at home. And I can't wait to attend there next year to pursue my degree in Nursing. There's nothing I would want to change about the campus."
Freshman,5,Not only is this school academically apparopiate for you major- offering the best field and education for furthering your career- they are also extremely welcoming!! I have never felt more at home and loved ( outside of my own home) than I have here.
Freshman,5,"As a incoming freshman. Everytime I would go visit the college, everyone was so welcoming and helpful. The administration was helpful with the application process. The professor's are very helpful, nice and welcoming. The school overall as a welcoming feel to it."
Sophomore,5,"I love the Christian culture on campus. In some classes, the professors pray before starting class. There is opportunity to go to chapel 3 times a week and worship with other students. There are other ministry opportunities, as well. The students are fantastic on campus, and the professors are amazing. They genuinely want you to succeed and will do whatever they can to help you be the best version of yourself you can be."
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved my time at Mt. Vernon Nazarene University. I made lifelong friends while I was there. I still go back to visit as often as possible, and now work with the Women's Auxiliary to help fund scholarships."
Freshman,5,"Mount Vernon Nazarene University is an amazing place. The teachers care about you and will help you with almost anything. They are always willing to talk. The people are great. It is difficult to walk down the sidewalk without somebody saying hi to you, even if they don't know you."
Graduate Student,5,this is a religious based college with a highly respected reputation and great ratings. I am furthering my education through MVNU to complete my MBA and move on up the ladder at work.
Niche User,5,I love Mount Vernon University. The campus is beautiful and the people are passionate. Can't wait to start in the Fall 2019
Sophomore,5,MVNU is a very welcoming campus that automatically feels like home. The faculty is amazing and try to get to know you personally.
Alum,5,"Coming from a rural community, I  loved the small-town atmosphere.  It was easy to get to know people and the professors all really care not only about whether you get a quality, faith-based education, but also about your growth as an individual. I made lifelong friends and learned more about my faith and serving God. I have never regretted my decision to attend MVNU!"
Sophomore,5,"I really like Mount Vernon Nazarene University, the campus has a very welcoming and loving environment. The University has a lot of activities and things that you can get involved in. I would really like to see Mount Vernon Nazarene University start to expand and grow in numbers and in housing."
Freshman,5,"I am a transfer student from Xavier University. I chose to attend MVNU due to the positive atmosphere, Christian environment, and small-town feel of the campus. I would highly recommend this university to anyone who wants a home away from home!"
Niche User,5,Mount Vernon Nazarene University is a very helpful and comfortable place. Everyone makes you feel welcomed and they are very kind. The campus is very beautiful in any season. It is also a small campus and it is very easy to meet new people. I love Mount Vernon Nazarene University and recommend everyone go and visit atleast once.
Sophomore,5,It is very personal and has a great Graphic Design program. Most professors are excellent. I feel like it takes a little longer than it should to graduate because of it being a Christian college. It has a lot of bible courses you are required to take.
Niche User,5,"The overall experience was lovely. The university makes you feel like you are at home. The people were wonderful and treat you like a human being, not just a number."
Freshman,5,"MVNU is a very friendly campus, as soon as you step on campus it instantly feels like home. The professors are very friendly and always there for any student, whether you are in their class or not."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my experience at MVNU so far. The atmosphere is inviting and welcoming. The students are friendly and kind. The staff is extremely personable and cares about you as a person, not just a student."
Freshman,5,"MVNU is a wonderful place that embraces an atmosphere of community and Christian fellowship. The student life is active and welcoming, as endless opportunities to participate keep one engaged and connected. The faculty are supportive and ready to meet in person with students to work with them through any situations or concepts."
Senior,5,"Honestly, I did not want to come or think about coming to this college. I absolutely refused at first.  Once I applied and got accepted I started to enjoy it, and actually felt like I belong.  The professors are amazing and are willing to go out of their way to help you succeed in class, but also in life and with a relationship with God. "
Sophomore,5,"MVNU is a fantastic school. I knew from the moment I toured the place with my dad that this would be my new home. The people here are  welcoming and genuinely care about connecting a person's future career with serving the Lord. I am biased, but the nursing program is amazing. The lab we work in is in great condition and we learn the skills we will be performing in the future right in the lab. The cafeteria offers a variety of foods to cater to as many tastes as possible, but there will always be days when someone complains there is nothing good to eat. The 586 (the snack shack in the Prince Student Union) is pretty good, but they do not serve full meals anymore, which is missed. The professors all care about the courses they teach. The price is the worst part, but MVNU has a boatload of endowments and scholarships students can apply for to ease the cost. It is an aesthetically pleasing campus as well. It is a great place and I recommend it. "
College Freshman,5,they don't allow drugs and alcohol and keep issues under control
College Senior,5,"Super safe since it is super strict, although the restrictions also lead to people going further out of their way which can be even worse possibly."
College Freshman,5,They are very willing to help you pursue your degree in any you wish to take it
College Freshman,5,"I love the Christian atmosphere and caring, intelligent professors and the students are so friendly and fun to do things with"
College Freshman,5,I love the way I can talk with any professor and/or advisor and receive any help that I need. Professors and staff are friendly and personable along with flexible in the sense of adjusting their schedule to my wants and needs. The courses I am taking have been considered by both myself and my advisor and align with the track set before me in order to graduate on time!
College Sophomore,5,It is a great small Christian school.
College Junior,5,This is one of the best schools I have attended.
College Junior,5,This school works hard to prepare students for the work force
College Junior,5,Always looking out for student safety
College Junior,5,Admission and learning about programs was easier than any other school that I had looked at
Recent Alumnus,5,"My four years at MVNU were the best years of my life so far. I still have close friendships with a multitude of people I met in this community â€” from professors, to staff, to, of course, fellow students."
Recent Alumnus,5,"My two closest friends and I all got well-paid jobs in our fields just months after graduation. Most of my graduating class is already using their degrees, and I don't know of any unemployed graduates."
Recent Alumnus,5,I never feared for my safety or experienced any form of assault or felt I was in the midst of unsafe circumstances in my time at MVNU.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The dorms are MUCH bigger than your usual dorm, and all come with a sink! The apartments can get slightly cramped with 6 people living in them, but are still roomier and nicer than what you typically find at other schools. Plus, it's nice that the apartments are townhouse style, so they each have a front door that opens out onto the shared courtyard."
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. I feel that there is no crime (I can leave my personal belongings almost anywhere and they will be there when I get back). There are reviews of special security measures and I feel very safe walking on campus at night.
College Freshman,5,There are lunches where they talk about internships all the time. Professors reccommend students for on campus jobs and interviews. Education majors are immediately immersed in field experience along with many other majors.
College Freshman,5,There are lunches where they talk about internships all the time. Professors reccommend students for on campus jobs and interviews. Education majors are immediately immersed in field experience along with many other majors.
College Freshman,5,I love being at MVNU. The people are great and I love the atmosphere.
College Junior,5,"My experience at Mount Vernon Nazarene University has been a complete blessing.  I have been able to get involved in several different ways.  I am actively involved in Enactus and lead a project that helps small businesses with marketing, graphic deisgn, data analysis, and other practices to help better the business.  I have also been selected to serve as the Vice President of Marketing for the MVNU Student Government Association which has allowed me to learn leadership skills as well as being able to apply what I am learning in the classroom.  The Christ centered atmosphere and the peers I get to journey alongside also have contributed to my MVNU experience."
College Sophomore,5,I love my school and its Christian atmosphere
College Sophomore,5,The school is ran like a small community and is purposeful in its spiritual foundation. I am a member of the soccer team as well and have found friends who will be friends for life. There is always someone willing to listen to you and your problems and support you emotionally as well as spiritually. Wouldn't change my decision at all.
College Student,5,I had a great time and the people were wonderful.
College Senior,5,MVNU is a small campus that makes it easy to build community among other classmates as well as with staff and professors. My time at MVNU has been truly rewarding. Getting to know the community on campus as well as the larger community of Mount Vernon has made this place feel like home for the past 3 1/2 years.
College Sophomore,5,"I love living on campus, being able to live near so many other students your age. It can get annoying if people are acting stupid and disrespectful, but if people keep themselves under control, it's the best experience of a lifetime."
College Freshman,5,It's the best to see students come together for a game
College Freshman,5,Mount Vernon Nazarene University is very inviting and has a great community. Everyone is happy to be there and are willing to help you.
College Junior,5,Class size is small and offers lower professor to student ratio.
College Junior,5,"The school offers an array of majors, a variety of study areas and options, and wonderful professors."
College Junior,5,"Campus housing is very spacious, updated, and clean."
College Freshman,5,There is hardly ever drug use on campus. There is strict policy and most kids abide by the ploicy. Its seldom for even alcohol to be present.
College Freshman,5,"I love my University. It has small classes so the professors can interact with you. The professors are generally approachable and easy to work with. The curriculum isnt too hard of an adjustment. It depends on your major,but most of the work load is just time consuming. Classes arent hard, per say, but you do need to focus and manage your time well to be successful."
College Freshman,5,I don't know of anyone using drugs or drinking but I'm guessing it happens.
College Freshman,5,It's a fairly small town so getting to a location is rarely a problem.
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone's very nice, its hard to find someone who's not. Its a very supportive community. "
College Sophomore,5,"I love this school, its very friendly and the professors are great. I'm not that crazy about tuition cost but the campus is worth it."
College Sophomore,5,"Campus safety is always there ensuring safety of students. Our housing has a great locking system so it's hard for anyone to break in. Our campus doesn't allow drinking, so drunkards aren't a problem. Our community is very warm and helpful so I never have to worry about being unsafe here on campus. "
Junior,4,"I took a single online class before everything went online for a while due to covid. It was very easy, no meeting time at all, I'm not sure if the prof was actually available or not but I never had any trouble."
Sophomore,4,"I only give online learning experience four stars because remote learning for students during COVID-19 was difficult for many professors and students to get used to at first. However, professors who are used to doing online learning are very good at what they do and provide you with many resources so you can succeed. Most professors are very good at communication and provide you with the best help they can give you."
Sophomore,4,During the COVID-19 pandemic the professors created an outstanding learning platform through the online learning
Junior,4,"Coming in as a transfer student it was hard to meet people because everyone is super cliquey. The professors; however, are great. The dorm rooms are okay. It is an old school so that is expected. So far I have had some pretty good experiences here."
Sophomore,4,I havenâ€™t yet taken an online course so i dont really have experience! But Iâ€™ve heard that teachers will make online learning the easiest possible
Sophomore,4,MVNU was amazing! I got to meet great people and professors are willing to help you outside of class so that you can learn the materials better
Sophomore,4,"MVNU isn't the greatest school in the world. It's in the middle of nowhere in a town where nothing happens. The main export of said town is religion, and when you start to drive around it becomes apparent why I say that. The student body also reflects that sentiment, and like all faiths, there are ""Christians"", and there are CHRISTIANS. That being said, the people here are some of the friendliest you will ever meet. The campus is small enough that the professors get to know you beyond your name and your major. The president and his wife are always getting involved with students and their everyday lives. One professor owns three golden retrievers that he brings to class just for students to pet and play with (you can often catch them in the quad chasing a ball of some sort). Even the tightest of cliques are welcoming to anyone in need. Overall coming here is the best decision I ever made."
Junior,4,"I would like to see more open-mindedness regarding off-campus housing. Students are required to live on campus unless they are age 23+, married, or living with their parents. However, off-campus housing may be financially better for many students compared to paying for room and board."
Niche User,4,One of the reasons that I choose to go to Mount Vernon because it is a bible based college. I love the Christian environment at this college.
Junior,4,I like the community at the school. Most people are very friendly and the professors are helpful and approachable even outside of class.
Freshman,4,Mount Vernon has a welcoming campus and staff is intent on helping all students achieve their dreams!
Sophomore,4,"It's a very small school, you pretty much know everyone. The only thing they could fix is the number of demanded chapel hours you have to have. If you don't have the number you need per grade level per semester, you have to pay money, I think like $20 or more for one missed until you meet the number they require you to have for the semester."
Junior,4,I enjoy the friendly people and atmosphere that makes up the MVNU community. I believe the professors care deeply about the students and invest in our lives. I wish that some of the residential living situations would be upgraded.
Alum,4,I graduated from MVNU and had a great experience there. I chose to attend because of the small campus and class sizes. I believe this really helped me excel in my education and I am very glad I chose MVNU.
Freshman,4,"Mount Vernon Nazarene University is a nice in-between zone for those who grew up in a sheltered Christian environment their whole life but don't want to go diving headfirst into a secular college environment and basically experience a bit of culture shock. The academics are good as well, and the professor's are typically really understanding and do their best to help you out here."
Freshman,4,"Great university for academics, the small school gives you the oppertunity to grow with support of great mentors and professors."
Freshman,4,MVNU has been a extremely welcoming place with many opportunities for social and academics. The professors are extremely helpful and friendly. As a freshman it's easy to get plugged in immediately.
Freshman,4,"Mount Vernon Nazarene University is a great college  for christians and people who are looking to just focus on their education  without any distraction. One of the things like about Mount Vernon Nazarene University is it small size campus, it is very easy to get around there. I also like how friendly people are there. My experience has been great so far at MVNU."
Junior,4,"I loved the faculty - they were genuinely caring, built relationships with their students, and were experts in their field. Most of the students were very kind, although they often lived up to the expectations of the school during the day and became completely different people once they were out of the classroom."
Freshman,4,"Considering the religious affiliation of this school, it isn't as sheltered as most. It's perfect for students who prefer smaller classes and the campus is easy to navigate because it's very small. Students and professors are kind and easy to get to know, and the school is great at making new students feel welcome through events and activities aimed towards helping students get to know people. There are restrictions and requirements, I mean, itâ€™s a private Nazarene school for crying out loud. Thereâ€™s chapel requirements, but they make it easy for you to skip a few and replace the credit by other means. As for restrictions, curfews and open dorms only apply to freshmen and the dorms, not apartments. It's a reasonable place, especially considering the religious affiliation and they are very careful in keeping the campus a safe place to be."
Sophomore,4,"When I think of this school, one word comes to mind: family. From the moment you step onto campus, you have people going out of their way to get to know you and make you feel welcomed. It is a small school, but it is big enough to where when you walk down the sidewalk  stranger greets you with a warm smile and a nice ""hello!"""
Sophomore,4,"I like that we are offered many options to be keep us in the word.  Whether it be small groups or chapel, it's the perfect fit for me."
Freshman,4,MVNU is a very loving community and they are very diligent in helping their students succeed in and out of the classroom. They are very Christian oriented and the classes are faith based.
Alum,4,"My time in Mount Vernon Nazarene University's art program was critical in developing my passion for the arts in a way that emphasized ethical and academic consideration while sharpening my technical ability. This has allowed me to pursue art in ways that keep me investigating my beliefs, while also being outwardly focused on ways of bettering the world around me. The art program at MVNU is small and intimate- your peers and professors quickly become like family. Though it exists in the context of a Nazarene school, the art department, and the school at large, is accepting and engaging of all backgrounds, cultures and beliefs. The school works hard to be intentional about cultivating community within student life, but also in the community around it. I am a better and more thoughtful person for having been part of the art department at Mount Vernon Nazarene University."
Freshman,4,"MVNU is pretty chill! The people are nice, facilities are decent, and faculty want you to succeed! However, the Caf food gets old fast. I'm in the Art department and the facilities are top notch! Equipment and rooms are top notch as well! Overall it's a good place for me to start my college career."
Sophomore,4,"Mount Vernon Nazarene University's former motto was ""Life Changing"". Although the top Christian University recently updated to ""Shine Forth,"" I can honestly say that making the decision to attend college at MVNU has changed my life. It is a small private school that provides great academics, not to mention national level attaining athletics, and amazing professors and students. The community life is what I appreciate the most, because you can't walk to class without receiving a smile from someone you don't know."
Sophomore,4,Mount Vernon is such a great campus. There main focus is community and all of the professors truly care about not only your academics but your personal self also.
Freshman,4,"Mount Vernon Nazarene University (MVNU) is one of the best colleges to transfer into as a high school student thanks to the wonderful staff and faculty and students already there who make people feel welcome and feel at home. MVNU is a very small, community based university so therefore it is easy to get to know someone fast and there is a lot of support for someone to be there. Academically, MVNU challenged me in ways my high school education could not and it has transformed me into a smarter and quicker learner, writer, speaker, and thinker. MVNU also has taught me over 1 semester how to be self-reliant and independent as an adult which is a great lesson to have in life. They do not call this school ""life-changing"" for nothing!"
Freshman,4,"Its wonderful. The staff and students are all very welcoming, theres plenty of events that happen on campus, and it seems as if everyone is there to help you."
College Freshman,4,They are very helpful in everything you do.  They pray with you which I feel is very important
College Freshman,4,MVNU is very concerned for the welfare of its students
College Freshman,4,It's very spacious and everything is convenient to get to
College Freshman,4,The facility includes a lot and is very friendly for both the athlete and non athlete alike
College Freshman,4,"The professors are experts and make their subjects interesting. The classes are all small, which means that you are known individually and cared about. I wish there was a larger variety of courses offered in all areas, though."
College Freshman,4,Most students generally feel pretty safe at school. Very few bad things ever happen there.
College Freshman,4,My school is extremely friendly and full of expert professors.
College Freshman,4,"Personally, I spend at least 5 hours a day in our library on campus in order to stay on top of all of my school work. I cannot speak for the general student body, but I am the type of student to push myself in the cirricular setting and I take school very seriously. Therefore, I would say that at times I place a good deal of stress on myself in order to achieve the desired grades I have. My work load can be more at times than others but I never have a problem finishing things on time. Through the course of this past year, my professors have been very kind and helpful."
College Freshman,4,"All students are required to fill out a sexual harassment training course at the beginning of the school year. Personally, I have never come in contact with assaults and feel extremely safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"We connect with multiple high schools throughout the year. In addition to connections, we also connect with our alumni and have huge financial support from them! However, I have not stepped up to the need of receiving an internship yet,so I am not a good canidate to rate how well the school will connect me with opportunities. Overall, I would say that my advisor does an excellent job on informing me of the essential hours I need in shadowing!"
College Freshman,4,"Housing seems to be fair and flexible. We do not seem to have much problem with accommodating towards certain needs. I would say that the dorms and apartments are pretty much average. Housing can be expensive however, we do have men and women who clean the facilities daily (except for on the weekend). Our housing does its best at making the living places social, however, we do not have much control over those who leave on the weekends or refuse to be involved. In addition, our dormitories are now only a two-person living space as opposed to three people. Therefore, the dorms are more spacious than a variety of other campus dorms."
College Freshman,4,"I love my school because it has given me wonderful opportunities to grow in my relationship with God, become a leader and learn to voice my opinion when appropriate. I have made wonderful connections and friendships and I know MVNU is the best school for me to achieve my undergraduate education most efficiently and with the best support."
Recent Alumnus,4,The on campus career services were a great help for me and my husband. We both work at a company that we were pointed towards from someone in career services.
Recent Alumnus,4,MVNU's community allowed me to be myself and figure out what that meant.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Students and the local community are greatly involved in attending varsity games, and most students participate in the wide range of intramural sports available."
College Freshman,4,I love my dorms! They're always clean and they are very spacious compared to most. The down side is the open dorms policy.
College Freshman,4,I love Mount Vernon Nazarene University! The students and professors are very kind and the staff is always helpful! The only downsides are the cafeteria food is not always edible and some weekends there is not much to do.
College Freshman,4,I feel that it is very expensive and the lack or air conditioning is very troublesome in the first couple of weeks on campus.
College Freshman,4,they are very encouraging on degrees
College Freshman,4,It is so welcoming and the teachers care about you.
College Sophomore,4,It has been an amazing year that this college.  If you need help you don't need to go far there is someone to help you anywhere. I love the test center and how they have help for people with  disabilities. The faculty as well as the students are kind and have big hearts. I wish there was more to do on this campus but when there is things to do its so much fun they try to get everyone involved.
College Freshman,4,"It's great, too bad you're not allowed to live there unless you're married or living with family."
College Freshman,4,Taco Bell is within 10 minutes. So is KFC and domino's delivers to your room. What more could you ask for as a poor college student?
College Freshman,4,"It all went smoothly.. until they forgot to add my meal plan on and I had an extra 2,000$ I owed. My advice? Don't stress out about it, just pay the bill and look for scholarships outside of the school."
College Senior,4,The new Arial Arena is great!
College Senior,4,You sign the MVNU policy agreement when you attend MVNU if you don't like it then don't come here.
College Sophomore,4,"Many students may think that our school is too strict, but I think that everyone who comes here expects a certain strictness. They know they are coming to a Christian school yet they expect to get to do whatever they want. There are boundaries and limitations for a reason."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't had any real troubles with the financial aid people. When my payment didn't go through in the fall they were very patient about working it out with me.
College Sophomore,4,"The 586 is great, the only bad thing is that since I can't eat gluten, the fryers are contaminated so I can't eat any french fries. I know this is something that I can get used to, I just miss french fries."
College Freshman,4,"I needed a lot of financial aid to be able to attend MVNU, and the financial aid office came through for me and gave me the scholarships and aid that I needed."
College Sophomore,4,"A few late-night options and unique places--however, not cheap."
Alum,2,"MVNU is all about its politics. Certain students and faculty are favored because they have relatives that are in high positions of the Nazarene community. The school does not care about the majority of its students, rather it is just looking to have high numbers of freshmen. If the school continues to listen to a small portion of people that make up the school it will most likely not survive. It is also important to note that the school is majorly in debt but continues to spend its money on things such as Esports..."
Alum,2,"I attended and later taught at this school.  The education I received was fairly poor, but it was good enough that by working part time in my field while a student I was able to teach myself enough to get into a good graduate school (At Ohio State), and eventually get my Ph.D.  I returned to teach here, and worked very hard to improve the quality of my major.  But in the mean time the  quality of the rest of the university kept dropping.  What happened was MVNU became increasingly interested only in their revenues, with almost no concern for hiring and supporting good faculty.  It finally became an ethical issue for me - how could I recruit students to my program when I knew the rest of their education would be extremely poor.
Also - a reoccurring theme (check other reviews) is MVNU's treatment of people.  Employees are treated terribly, and students are not respected."
Freshman,2,"Overall MVNU is not a bad school. I like almost all of the professors, they want you to succeed. They handle roommate issues awful. If you want to move rooms you have to talk to the RA AND the RD and they dont want to move you. They would rather sit down and have a big group therapy session and pray about it instead! Some people just are not compatible! Chapel is required and you get charged a hefty fine if you decide not to go. The food is awful. I understand that no college food is going to be great, but I opened up the bag of bagels and there was mold everywhere on them. There is nothing to do on campus on the weekends because everyone goes home. Freshman have a curfew of midnight. Opposite genders in the dorms is only two times a week from 8-12 and the door must be open to 90 degrees, lights on, no blankets, no laying down, need to be a good distance apart. You have a dress code (no leggings or short shorts)."
College Senior,2,I haven't really heard much about employment or internships. The only thing I can say I have seen is a flyer for office workers.
College Freshman,2,If you put one foot out of line at any point in time and you're liable to end your academic career! On top of that they send you to counseling like you're some kind of nutcase who is throwing their life out the window.
College Freshman,2,MVNU is not a party school. For parties you have to go to Kenyon College. Sometimes a class will host a formal or some sort of event which are usually pretty good.
College Sophomore,2,"Many rules, especially regarding dorm life."
College Senior,2,It is absolutely boring in the town.
College Senior,2,There isn't much of a variety.
College Freshman,2,Our Greek life is based on GPA in your major. Its not the traditional Greek life and the professors nominate you to be involved.
College Freshman,2,The university is strict about things college kids like to do. The dorms are the strictest part of campus. The rules are insane and sometimes uncalled for.
College Sophomore,2,"It is cold for most of the academic year, and very cold in the winter. There are seasons, but winter is a bit longer than the rest. Prepare for snow."
College Sophomore,2,We are a dry campus.
College Freshman,2,The weather varies quite a bit so you need to have more warm and cold clothes.
College Sophomore,2,There doesn't seem to be a lot of housing options to choose from due to the little town. I haven't fully explord the options though because i have to live on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is already pretty small, so you are not going to have too many people walking around.  Also, this year 2012-13 there's going to be construction, so it will be different at night.  People will work during the day, then leave everything at night.  There is one major building-Student Union, but there's not really anything to do.  There used to be a ""game room"" but there's some broken equipment.  You have to create your own game nights, movie nights, or just get off campus and go to Walmart."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Could Be Worse â€“ the campus is decent, but could use some work. the school is building a new athletic center soon so that should liven things up a bit, but overall things are pretty good."
College Senior,2,"Okay but Makes Me Sick on Occasion. The food has made me sick numerous occasions. I know it is the food here because I will go home and be fine then come back, eat and I will be sick again. Also it gets kind of repetitive. All the best foods are served on the same day. It would be nice to have everyone's favorites spread out through the week instead of having them all on one day."
College Senior,2,"Non Existant Off Campus â€“ No clubs, or anything really off campus. On campus events put on by sga are ok, could be used for improvement. Same old things, change would be nice."
College Senior,2,Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free Card â€“ Varsity sports are really popular on campus. Most students go to the games and support the teams at every game. The sports teams tend to get the benefit of the doubt and being able to play is more important than discipline for breaking the rules. The facilities aren't the best.
College Junior,1,There is no Greek life
College Freshman,1,"Mount Vernon Nazarene University has absolutely great academics and awesome professors! However, this place makes me want to tear my hair out. The dorm life is extremely strange and depressing, you can only hangout with the opposite gender 2 nights a week as a freshman with very strict rules on keeping the door open at 90 degrees and having to sit vertical without touching one another. If you are planning on having a boyfriend or girlfriend as a freshman at MVNU, you might as well forget about it because your relationship will get ruined. It is hard to find genuine people here is you are a mainstream type of person. If you were used to being popular in high school, you will be out casted by the band kids, homeschoolers, and odd ones for attending MVNU is how they get revenge. Social life here is slim, and im not just talking about parties, but there is literally nothing to do!! The school promises all these events clubs and activities going on, but they are very far an few between. If youre looking for a fun college experience THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR YOU even if youre not looking to party every weekend, there is still nothing to do. Campus is dead on the weekends, there's no where to just hangout, the food is only good on visit days, and freshmen have a curfew of 12:00. this place is terrible."
College Sophomore,1,"Bad decision.  Campus is beautiful and small yet, terribly boring.  There is nothing to do on campus and it is very strict.  Chapel is three times a week and if you don't go to 36 of them there is a fine for each chapel missed.  The majority of the teachers toss extremely difficult information at you with little instruction.  The majority of the kids on campus are weird and fake.  If you are on a sports team that would be the only reason to stay enrolled.  If you enjoy windy long walks and mandatory class attendance all year come to MVNU.  Personally transferring for SURE next year."
College Freshman,1,"If you want to party, go elsewhere. Too much risk, not enough fun."
College Sophomore,1,I am super glad that we are not a party school. I never wanted to be in that environment where college kids do stupid stuff like getting drunk when they are super busy with building relationships and homework.
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene
College Senior,1,I feel like a prisoner because its so strict.
College Senior,1,There isn't much diversity or acceptance.
College Senior,1,Students are racist and very ignorant.
College Senior,1,There isn't enough space. I'd like to have my own room.
College Senior,1,We aren't allowed to have real parties.
College Freshman,1,"what nightlife? If you are looking for something to do its either homework, tv or play cards. If you want something more exciting then go to the nearby college campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,MVNU has pretty strict rules that are enforced by campus police and administration. Curfews are in effect and cohabitation is strictly prohibited. Alcohol/drug use is also prohibited on campus. Shorts are not allowed in the chapel or in class.
College Sophomore,1,"Very Strict â€“ I am a commuter, but I constantly hear complaints from classmates that live on campus that they are too strict when dealing with the curfew policy/open dorms.  The students are required to follow the guidelines concerning their curfews which are 1:00 a.m. for freshman, and maybe 2:00 for the remaining grades.  Also, there should be absolutely no drugs/alcohol on campus!  Several students were dis enrolled from the university without a first time warning or offense simply because the university is Christian."
College Freshman,1,Not Really Much to Do â€“ well people hang out at the PSU and play pool and chill
College Senior,1,Wireless Is Only Provided in Certain Areas â€“ Wireless internet is provided but it is only provided in certain areas. The wireless rarely ever works and can be very frustrating when internet is needed in class or doing homework online. The chapel is the worst place. Computer labs aren't full very often but it can get very crowded and full during midterms and finals week.
College Senior,1,"Not Good. The food is consistently cold, overcooked, and not seasoned well.  The selection is terrible since I want to eat delicious food that is very healthy.   As an education student I have to eat breakfast and pack a lunch early and there is never any breakfast options besides sugary cereal or white bread bagels.  The sack lunch options are also minimal and unhealthy."
College Senior,1,"I'm tired of school, I'm tired of paying people so I can work for them. I want to get payed to work"
College Junior,1,"Overall the college is very strict. There is limited visitation hours for opposite gender peers in the apt and dorms. No drinking, no drugs, no smoking. If you do advertise something going on against the rules you will most likely get busted."
College Junior,1,"Too Strict? Okay, if you're looking for a party school, from the moment you walk onto campus you'll know MVNU isn't for you. There is no drinking, no drugs, no partying. Yes there is some, as you will find anywhere but it's a select few and if you really want to, you can find friends that will, but most will not. Punishments are severe for things of the like but you're told from the time you enroll what they are if you choose to do these things, so that isn't too strict because you're forewarned. The worst is the internet blocks and the blocking of a few tv channels like MTV, FX, and Comedy Central. That's where I feel they take it too far. We're all adults here, they should trust us to be able to handle the things we see."

Junior,5,The Mount did a good job adapting to online instruction during the pandemic. Professors lectured and worked with their students over Zoom and other forms of communication media to teach their classes.
Junior,5,"My first few years have been great here. I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews for the apparent lack of a party scene. I get that its college, but if you want to act like a child, then stay in high school. The professors really care about their students and work hard to make sure they succeed. It isn’t a perfect school, but students who want change have the opportunity to make that happen. Don’t let lazy and complacent students ruin the idea of this school for you if you want to come here."
Junior,5,Online is a transition for a lot of students but the Mount has made it as smooth as it could possibly be. Through using zoom & another means of communicating with professors/classmates we as a university were able to make the best experience for online learning that one could have given the world’s challenges.
Junior,5,As a Mount student the campus provides minimal distractions given its location and a smaller atmosphere which is perfect for your study habits to increase while establishing a great circle of friends.
Niche User,5,Mount St. Mary is a very interesting campus that provides job placement advancement to the major that you are studying. The campus life lets you explore yourself to see what you will be in the world. Their sports are very competitive seeing their previous games throughout the school year.
Freshman,5,"Great professors, great dorms(But freshmen dorms), great students. This is definitely not a party school(obviously because this is a catholic university) but if you know how where the parties at(mostly in the sports houses) then you will have a great time. People will hold the door for you and when you choose to find good people, many good people are going to be there for you and support you. If you like a small campus, then you will love the mount. I love the great education, especially the business program which they offer. The mount is very beautiful and it would be handy if you had a car or know a friend who has a car to explore the area with the beautiful scenery! It’s definitely a great university if you’re looking for a great education, sports and activities, small school, teacher to student connection, great people, and great staff."
Niche User,5,Great School considering how small it is. Dorms are great and the students attending are all very friendly and all share a common trait which is their religion.
Junior,5,The Mount is a very proud school. They are there to help YOU succeed. TheMount offers a variety of assets to help you throughout your years there and even after graduation. There is a career center that will put your resume out so that employers can view you and have the chance to hire you. They also have smaller classes which means more focus on you rather than being in a lecture with 80+ people.
Alum,5,I love the mount for its small class size. It was the perfect atmosphere to learn and gain my B.S. in chemistry. The professors were very knowledgeable.
Alum,5,"A most beautiful campus and a great diversity of students, known by employers and the general public as a special place to get a quality education and a foundation in ethics and good judgement. Highly respected by all for the quality of the finished product."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman in college, I felt welcome by my peers and the staff. When I was moving in, the orientation leaders were very kind and helpful. I love how the Mount provides events for the students on weekends so we can enjoy our time here at the Mount. I also love the small campus. I am able to connect with my professors and learn more as a result. There are a variety of activities and clubs for the students to join. Because I am Catholic, I am freely allowed to practice my own religion and not be judged. I love that I there there is a church on campus and I am able to walk up to The Grotto as well."
Freshman,5,Mount St. Mary's University's orientation process was very thorough and well-organized.  I felt like I was home right away.  My first year so far has been inspiring and exciting.  The Freshman Symposium class has helped my transition to college tremendously.
Junior,5,"My experience at The Mount has been one that I wouldn't change at all. I've met some of the most genuine people, taken really good classes, and grown stronger in my faith. The professors on campus are really driven and always try to help students succeed in any way they can. The extracurriculars are extremely diverse as are the majors. Personally, I'm majoring in Health Sciences, but there are so many other majors; business, accounting, education, fine arts, history, foreign languages, sociology, psychology, criminal justice, just to name a few. I've had more opportunities at the Mount than I have anywhere else, and for that, I wouldn't change a thing. This university has helped to mold me into who I am today."
Freshman,5,"The Mount is a college that provides a family atmosphere, and where the professors care about the students and their academic success. In addition, I would like to see The Mount incorporate a shuttle service for student transportation."
Alum,5,"As a recent Mount Alum, I loved everything the school had to offer. I made many life long friendships there. I am not Catholic and I fit in, with no problems. The mount is not in the busiest area, but that does not stop the students from having a good time. My first thought, when leaving the campus after graduating, was that I could not wait to go back for alumni weekend/reunions."
Freshman,5,"The Mount is a truly unique university. Bolstered by a strong foundation in the Catholic intellectual tradition, the Mount provides a fantastic education. If you are interested in a school that is interested in you, personally, seriously consider the Mount. To solidify your decision, take a campus tour; it is truly a beautiful campus."
Sophomore,5,Mount Saint Mary is a good school. It is a very safe place for students. The dorms and the education is great. Also the professors are amazing at what they do.
Sophomore,5,I love it all the proffesors students staff and faculty are amazing and care about you and will make you succed. You arent just a number your a person with a name.
Sophomore,5,"I went for my student acceptance day and fell in love with the campus and the people who live there. its literally on the side of the mountain and on the top of the mountain there is the grotto. a very beautiful, calm, and charming place."
Sophomore,5,"I love the smallness of the campus and the classes themselves. You know everyone, and it helps to get more one-on-one time with professors and advisors."
Sophomore,5,"What I liked about Mount Saint Mary's was the diversity of thought. Even though it is a catholic school, it would let students be themselves no matter what religious or political preference. I also liked the academics there. I thought the assignments were very thought-out and fair in how they were assigned. Some professors would give us daily readings, and some would extend the dates of important works if needed. The only complaint I had about the university was the cafeteria food. I think the food was average at best, and should add new arrangements or new recipes."
Sophomore,5,Mount St. Mary's is a great university with really nice teachers but it is very small which means there are not a lot of options academically.
Freshman,5,"Although the mount ended up not being the right school for me, it does not make it a bad school because everyone has different preferences. The campus is very beautiful. In the fall the leaves on the trees take on many different colors making the campus look so picturesque. In the winter the snow that covers the campus makes it look so peaceful and beautiful. In the spring and summer time the campus is blooming with so many flowers and plants and is so colorful. The classes are small and intimate and every professor that I had was great. Never rude or condescending. There is also a strong community vibe on campus and many people are kind. I really liked the strong Catholic tradition and how the church was right near the dorms if you ever wanted to go to Sunday morning mass or just meditate. The parties are ok but were not usually fun for me."
Sophomore,5,"The cost is super high, it is super small, in the middle of no where, beautiful, and one of the friendliest campuses. 
If you are looking to party your four years, do not come here. It is extremely small and you soon recognize 90% of the campus population. There isn't much to do unless you want to drive 20 minutes, but the school throws events constantly such as zip lining, movies, intramural sports, and so much more. They try to make this the best time for you.
The teachers are here to help and support you in any means possible. You get to know them on a personal level due to the small sizes of the classes, rarely exceeding 20 students."
Freshman,5,"They people there are so nice! Everything from the academics to the diversity is amazing. The campus is so nice, it wasn’t hard to make a decision of where I am going to go to school."
Freshman,5,"So far everythings been really good, the school and staff wants you to do well. theres so many things set up for you to succeed, and do well here. the only problem is the location, theres not much to do here off campus."
Sophomore,5,"I've made great friends and my professors really care about their fields and not just teaching, but discussing. Even though most of my professors are devout Catholics, they encourage discussion of religion and different beliefs and mindsets. I love it there."
Sophomore,5,"Mount St. Mary's is a great University. The students are friendly, and the professors are very helpful and are always available to help you. The clubs are very intriguing! There is always something to do on campus, you will never be bored. The Mount is wonderful and will help any student excel."
Freshman,5,"What I liked about  the mount was how they were able to intertwine faith, education and college life so seamlessly.  The other students  are pretty chill and everybody is doing their own thing and there isn't too much drama.  I really have no complaints it's a great school."
Freshman,5,"Everyone is very friendly and the environment is great! The campus is beautiful, and peaceful. There is a Starbucks on campus, and the food is pretty good"
Freshman,5,Great community and diversity of students. Many clubs and organizations to join. There is a club for anyone and anyone can find what they're interested in.
College Freshman,5,they have a variety of assistance.
College Freshman,5,It's a drug free school.
College Freshman,5,"Security, visible on campus. i do feel safe here."
College Freshman,5,I do not have campus housing due to living near by the campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Professors are great with students, because of the personal attention that they provide us with."
College Sophomore,5,"Career services is great, it helps with mostly everything regarding job searching, etc."
College Sophomore,5,"Something that makes MSMU unique is the fact that Professors are great with the one on one attention, due to the small class sizes. Another important facet is the matter that everybody knows each other and there is great networking connections all around."
College Freshman,5,Everyone is super nice and helpful at all times
College Sophomore,5,the admissions process is good.
College Sophomore,5,can you please give the students that are tall a bed not attached to the wall. thanks
College Sophomore,5,"When I first went to the Mount, I did not know what to expect. I was afraid and not sure how things would be for my first year in college. the professors are dedicated and willing to help the students. I love the Mount and would encourage all students to come and get this great experience that no one tell you about, you have to see for yourself."
College Sophomore,5,The courses have been great. I enjoy the classes and the professors are very helpful when need be. They communicate with their students on a weekly basis and grade quickly.
College Sophomore,5,Athletics are very important here. School spirit and support is great!
College Freshman,5,"The staff and security look out for the students regarding safety. There are groups that offer therapy and counseling for women that have been sexually assaulted. Overall, they do the best they can to make sure we are in a safe environment at all times."
College Freshman,5,I have had a good experience in my first year.  A little expensive but a very good school.
College Freshman,5,"Every since I have been enrolled in college, I have not heard of any significant crimes committed on campus."
College Freshman,5,"Some of the courses offered at this institution are quite difficult, however, every professor works hard to ensure that every student understands the course  material in its entirety."
College Freshman,5,Emails are sent out daily regarding internship opportunities.
College Freshman,5,"Campus housing is very expensive, however, the conditions of the dorms are bearable."
College Freshman,5,The athletics at Mount St. Mary's University are great. There is a tremendous amount of student invlovement in reference to fan support and school spirit. Students are excited to see all of the athletes perform.
College Freshman,5,"My overall experience at Mount St. Mary's University thus far has been great. Peers, as well as faculty, and advisors are very helpful at helping me find the right major that will benefit me in the long run. This school is perfect!"
Recent Alumnus,5,Everyone is always very friendly and helpful.
Recent Alumnus,5,I have always been able to add the courses i need! Waitlisting is never an issue at MSMU.
College Junior,5,Some of the professors and classes are difficult but those are usually the classes where I learn the most. The professors encourage students to work together on projects and classwork. I like that.
College Junior,5,I feel safe on this campus at all times of the night.
College Junior,5,all of my friends who graduated the year before me have all landed jobs in what they wanted to do and many of my classmates who haven't graduated are already interviewing and some accepted jobs for after graduation. I go to our career center often to help with internships and my resume.
College Junior,5,My professors have been great. Many have acted as mentors and there when I need advice for classes or career direction.
College Junior,5,"Talking with my friends who attend other universities, I hear them talk about massive lecture halls and never meeting their professors and I think that is crazy. My professors have all personally played a huge part in helping me figure out my career path and being cool advisors. I've never had a class in a lecture hall either."
College Sophomore,5,"The athletic facilities are fantastic! Although we're a D1 school, our teams aren't the best."
Graduate Student,4,"Online classes are ok, lectures are long and sometimes it gets boring ,but, as every other online class."
Junior,4,"Living on campus is great, the only complaint was the lack of air conditioning my freshman year in the freshman dorms. Those who work at the college are always helpful and the professors are great."
Sophomore,4,"I didn’t have the best freshman year at the Mount but I still think it is a great school. The town itself isn’t the best but Gettysburg and other nearby cities are cool. Classes are interesting and the people are nice. I love visiting the grotto above the school, too!"
Freshman,4,I love how it's located in the country and not the cities. This school is very different and love the catholic community strengthen it's students. The teachers here really care for us and strive us to do better.
Niche User,4,I like the small environment. I like that it is able to have what I want to study. I think they should have more resources and places around them. They're a great school!
Freshman,4,"Overall Enjoyed the experience. The people have been super friendly and very inclusive, so i never felt isolated even when I had just started out. Being that I'm from Philly, it's also nice to not be all that far from home, so I can still see my family and friends."
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and the classes are challenging but passable. There are no close places to explore outside campus that is near.
Sophomore,4,I love the community the mount creates. There are so many oppurtunities for students to take advantage of and get involved on campus. The teachers actually care about the students and are always willing to help. Everyone is very friendly.
Senior,4,"Great School. A little out in the middle of nowhere, but the professors are very helpful.  Good learning atmosphere."
Freshman,4,I'm a freshman but so far it's been a great experience. I'm on the men's rugby team and it's my first year playing rugby and so far it has been fun. All of my teammates are helpful and because it is a small school i have many friends and the classes are much smaller than bigger schools.
Sophomore,4,"Mount Saint Mary's is a small but lively school. There is a lot of student activities,groups, and clubs even though it is often overwhelming when one is trying to focus on academics. As far as staff and faculty go, they are very nice and understanding, quite friendly and willing to help out a struggling student. There are a number of organizations that work to provide many services to the students such as the excellent food services in Patriot Hall, or the diligent custodial and maintenance crews. The dorms are alright s far as dorms go, but don't have too much room so its unwise to pack too much. The campus is both lively and quite depending on the crowd that you associate with. almost everything is within a short walking distance and concentrated together giving ample time to get to class. Overall MSMU is a very nice school with great staff and faculty, academics, clubs, resources, and more."
Niche User,4,Mount St. Mary's is a great school they make sure you feel welcomed and at peace with everything on campus. Mount St. Mary's allow for connections of students and staff. They also keep you well informed through the application process and then deciding a school for you.
Junior,4,I love the Mount. They have a really awesome community and were really welcoming when I transferred in. All of their staff are amazing and really encouraging!
Junior,4,"Mount St. Mary's is the perfect school for you if you like a smaller community school.  With the smaller community, there are smaller sized classes, the professors share interest in the students learning.  You won't find yourself sitting in a class of 50 or so people, the classes are the perfect size to feel like your not sitting at the dinner table with your family, but feel like you still can get a word in during a discussion in class."
Freshman,4,This university is great. It is small while offering the classes I want and the activities I want. I'm only in my first year and I'm already learning many new things. The teachers are superb too; they are very smart and considerate. You can tell that they care about their students. I definitely feel like I can make a name for myself from this university.
Freshman,4,"Mount St. Mary's is a very safe and welcoming environment. There are many activities they do to involve the students and get them to try new things. The teachers are welcoming and make time to meet students if they need help with anything, they are very good on one on ones.  They could have better food and healthier options, places to eat are far from the school, so it is difficult to get from the school to other places."
Niche User,4,"Mount St. Mary's is right by the highway, and is easy to access. The students, staff, and faculty are extremely nice and welcoming."
Freshman,4,So far my experience of living and studying on campus of mount st. marys university has been overwhelming i have learned and changed a lot since i first started in the fall of 2017. It has been a great and rigorous experience personal responsibility becomes more present but also your peers and professors take great interest in you succeeding in all your classes you take no matter who you are and that is very important to me and others who attend this university.
Senior,4,"The small class sizes allowed me to feel comfortable to ask questions and learn in the environment in which I learn best. That it is a small school also means that I could join many clubs and activities without being cut. In terms of academic support and faculty support, this school does a great job. The sports programs here are also decent, and attract many athletes and fans. Mount St. Mary's is isolated from any big city or relationship with surrounding towns."
Senior,4,"The Mount is very focused on the individual. The professors are very personable and they all remember their students; I have had professors from my freshman year remember me and say hello to me three years later. There are also a large amount of resources available to students to help them with a multitude of issues ranging from choosing classes to searching for jobs. I have never had a truly bad experience at the Mount, and will be very sad to graduate and leave my beautiful mountain home in the spring."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy everything about the Mount! It is a beautiful school on a gorgeous mountain in rural Emmitsburg, MD. The small student to professor ratio gives each student the opportunity to personally get to know each professor and to build a professional, but personal relationship with each faculty and staff member. The other students and members of the Mount community including coaches, priests, seminarians, and alumni are very involved in the school and try to make the students feel a part of a larger community. I have enjoyed each moment at the Mount because it has become my home away from home! Seriously, I call it home even when I am away from it! If I had to go through the college selection process again, I would still choose the Mount. Even though it is an older school in a country area, the people have made my three years at the Mount feel like I am in the city on a new campus. The community definitely sets the Mount apart from the many schools I toured. I am Mount Proud!"
Freshman,4,"The best part about the Mount is that you are put in a small classroom size. Due to this you are able to interact with your professors, and even build a bond with them. You would be able to go to their office hours, and receive extra help or clarification. Unlike larger universities, where you would be in a lecture with 300 people, it would seem impossible to get the necessary help. Also the curriculum helps you explore other studies that would seem tedious at first, but may profound a new interest in you."
Alum,4,"I loved the small classes. I was able to know my professors and talk to them one on one. The student life provided very many opportunities and activities for the area and location. The campus is always clean and very beautiful. For such a small campus the food was excellent. The dorms and apartment living could be better, but what is a college experience without that."
Sophomore,4,The amount is a very intriguing school. Academics are a main factor which is a good thing because that's what college is for. The teachers make themselves available to students beyond regular office hours which makes relationships more personal. The class sizes are small that allows students to get more one on one attention. The campus has some diversity but not a lot. There isn't many parties unless you go off campus.
College Freshman,4,So far experience has been great!
College Freshman,4,"Overall, experience has been very positive."
College Freshman,4,So far the experience is great.
College Freshman,4,So far this university has been very welcoming and cant wait to start my journey and graduate.
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty safe because security's are always roaming around campus making sure everything is running smoothly.
College Sophomore,4,"I personally live in the dorms here, and so far it has been a wonderful experience. I recommend it to everyone is they have the chance."
College Sophomore,4,Great variety of workout items.
College Junior,4,"Over the last 2 years at the Mount, I believe that the faculty and staff are very competent. They are very knowledgeable about the subject matter and are capable of teaching the material effectively."
College Junior,4,"It's convenient for most students to live on campus. Since there isn't much to do in the immediate surrounding area of the Mount, the SGA and AMP try to find activities to get students involved in. Socially, it may not be the absolute best but many people have their group of friends to fall back on."
College Junior,4,"Although the Mount was not my first choice in college, I chose to attend the Mount because it was a decent distance away from home, they gave a good amount of academic scholarship compared to other schools I applied to and I had an opportunity to begin working in my field of study upon arrival as a freshman. The opportunities at the Mount are great and the friendships and connections I have made are valuable and lifelong."
College Sophomore,4,very health oriented for athletes and non-athletes
College Sophomore,4,we have a beautiful campus
College Junior,4,"For the most part, everyone I know feels completely safe on campus. We walk around by ourselves at any time during the day or night without worry."
College Sophomore,4,The gym is the greatest.
College Freshman,4,The career center sends out emails to the entire student body about internship (paid and non paid) opportunities.
College Freshman,4,MSMU is great on teaching students about sexual assault. They are very supportive of victims of sexual assault. I think everyone feels pretty safe on campus.
College Student,4,My experience at Mount St. Mary's has been incredible. Even just the way my acceptance letter was delivered told me they took their time and really want students to go to their school. The food is impeccable and the students are all so nice and kind.
College Freshman,4,If ever needed all you have to do is call public safety and they will be there for you!
College Freshman,4,From what I've heard people usually have good career prospects
College Freshman,4,"If you pay attention in class and actually put the effort in to learn and understand what's being taught then you should be fine. Procrastinating is your worst enemy,trust me, been there done that."
College Freshman,4,You get the real college experience living on campus and the dorms aren't that bad it's just something to get used to.
College Freshman,4,"Besides a little drama that happened my freshman year, it's a really good school academic wise and have a wonderful community!"
College Freshman,4,I love the courses and professors! Every professor is passionate about what they teach which makes it interesting to learn. They have this type of charisma which makes the classes fun! The class sizes are also great. I love how there are about 20 students or less in each class which makes it easier for students to approach the professor. I also like how each class is different as each professor has their own method of teaching.
College Freshman,4,"I feel that I was lucky to have been accepted because the school offers many resources if I ever have questions on certain topics. The staff and counselors are very helpful. Students are also very welcoming, it is great college to be at and the curriculum is rigorous so I feel that I am definitely getting my moneys worth. However, it may be very expensive, it will be worth it in the long run."
College Sophomore,4,We have a large and very involved security office and they take rules and security seriously.
College Sophomore,4,Some of the professors work in the field that I am studying and have assured me I will be able to find internships and a job following graduation.
College Sophomore,4,"So far I've only had one teacher that was not top notch.  All others are great:  supportive, helpful and very knowledgeable."
College Sophomore,4,"Love my school.  It has been a great experience getting involved in all the many activities and taking part in entertainment.  Also, teachers are very helpful and knowledgeable for the most part.  I've only had one bad experience with a teacher."
College Freshman,4,School safety and health are pretty good.  We girls always try to be together when walking at night.
College Freshman,4,So far so good.  I have meet good people that will be my friend hopefully for a long time.
College Freshman,4,"MSMU has a very low rate in crime and instances in which students have felt threatened. It probably helps that we are literally located on a mountain in a wealthy neighborhood, but I have never once felt that I should be afraid of students or visitors coming to the Mount. Campus crime is very low because most students here are so friendly and already acquainted with one another; there's truly no reason for someone to harm another in our environment. Security is always available and always seen walking around to regulate events and programs at the school. Because we are an all girls university, I suspect that security is a bit tighter than it would be at a larger co-ed institution."
College Freshman,4,"Mount is very very active in promoting internships, job opportunities, volunteer opportunities, tickets to talk events/programs and etc. through its email from various directors around campus. It regularly holds conferences for different majors to introduce its students to directors of interested and affiliated organizations that are looking for fresh faces and new graduates looking for work. There is no shortage in these sort of opportunities given by the career center at the Mount and if one asks, there is always something available if someone is looking for a specific focus."
College Freshman,4,My experiences with my professors and courses have been nothing short of great so far at the Mount. I haven't met any professor that doesn't clearly have a passion for what they're doing and are often vocal about what else they do in their field other than teach. A lot of my professors share their experiences that are applicable to our future careers and are more than willing to foster relationships with their students. Courses have always been interesting and have almost always contained information that I have a real interest in understanding; it helps that it's very obvious our professors love teaching just as much as we want to learn!
College Freshman,4,"MSMU is a great school for me personally, because as a small school, everything is in reach and readily available for when I need it. Advisors and professors are almost always available and more than willing to help and foster a personal relationship with their students. Mount is definitely unique in that we have a strong ""culture of kindness"" that really resonates with prospective students and visitors to the Mount. Mount has a philosophy of helping its neighbors and the world in the most positive way it can, and has a strong vision of sending out 'healers' from its school. Although I never visited Mount before applying for colleges, visiting the school after deciding to attend was one of the luckiest experiences I have ever had; I absolutely felt like this was the school for me because of the extreme reliability of all the faculty and really diverse class that really felt similar to my environment at home."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of things to prevent sexual assault in place on the campus, but sometimes it still happens."
College Freshman,4,"If I had to choose again, I'd probably choose Mount St. Mary's, but I do consider going to an art grad school later on."
Freshman,2,"This school is literally high school 2.0. There’s absolutely nothing to do on or off campus. You’re either in class, sitting in a dorm room, or eating. No where close to go out unless you drive half an hour away. Dorms are terrible, freshman dorms are horrendous with no air conditioning and look like a literal hospital room. No night life or weekend life, people are rude and stingy Catholics. Public safety is rude. Overall too small of a campus with absolutely nothing to do."
Freshman,2,Its a beautiful campus with really nice faculty but thats all it has to offer.                            .
Alum,2,"I really enjoyed the location of the school as well as the people I met along the way. I liked that it was small & the classes were small. However, the psych department was garbage & so unorganized. There were so many horrible teachers I had that just didn't care about their job. They were so wrapped up in their other jobs or outside life & could care less about their students needs. Getting in contact with professors was often times a joke & when you did get time, half the time they could help you because they were to busy with their other teaching job or graduate school. I was really disappointed in the academics of this school as well as the lack of organization throughout administration & the registrar. They have given me the wrong grades that have needed to be corrected as well as lost papers that I've turned in. It's very unprofessional."
College Freshman,2,It lacks. The student diversity is great but it is literally like high school 2.0. There is no social life on this campus unless you really really try. Public safety is crazy and there is so much restriction. Rarely are there fun activities to engage in. The school is way too small and everyone knows your business whether you like it or not. The only good thing about this school is the basketball team.
College Sophomore,2,"It's college: most guys just want an easy girl. Very religious guys stick with other very religious girls, popular guys stick with popular girls, nerdy guys stick with nerdy girls. It's very hard to be an ""inbetweener"" girl who isn't super attractive or up for anything and have a guy notice you. This isn't to say all the guys are scumbags, it's just most of the ones who aren't are already taken or are still 19-21 year old guys who have pretty vapid expectations for a girl even if they're nice guys."
College Sophomore,2,We're in a small town. Not much to do unless you drive twenty to thirty minutes away
College Freshman,2,"I party, however I am lucky that one of my friends doesn't drink.  Because in order to get to a party you need to drive.  However there has been weekend where no one throws down making the party scene no existent at the Mount.  Be prepared for some boring weekends if you plan to attend."
College Junior,2,"The only late night option we have is sheets

we do not have a 24 hr mcdonalds the one in emmitsburg closes at 10, and the one in thurmont closes at 12

most of our dining fast food options are in thurmont 

the closest chipotle is in frederick 

the only places that deliver on campus is simply asia which is outrageously expensive and pizza hut."
College Freshman,2,There is little to no off campus housing at the Mount.
College Freshman,2,The Mount is so strict it is annoying at times. Like if you are a girl and you have boy in your room after midnight on a week night you get documented and the curfew is 2 am on Friday and Saturday nights. Which I think is uncalled for we are adults and in college I do not see the need for a curfew. One nice thing though is that the are not to strict about alcohol like at all.
College Junior,2,I've only had fun twice at any parties at my university in all 3 years
College Junior,2,Each year it give me constant trouble
College Junior,2,We do not have a Greek on campus for the students.
College Senior,2,In order to find something to do off campus you have to travel 15 minutes north or south to the closest towns.
College Senior,2,The only people who really move off campus are the athletes and that is to avoid getting in trouble.
College Sophomore,2,The school is very strict for alcohol and drugs but if you get a parking ticket you can usually get out of it.
College Sophomore,2,"Mount St. Mary's is a small school and there is no Greek Life.  The possible party houses are baseball, lacrosse, and rugby, which usually all get busted before midnight.  Those are the only three houses to party at and none of the teams have parties during the season.  Sometimes people have casual pre games that you can turn into a party by telling a random person and then all of the freshmen show up.  All parties are too far off campus to walk and finding a ride is difficult."
College Sophomore,2,"Because there is not much around, it is hard to find something within a 5 mile radius that will not make you sick after you eat it."
College Sophomore,2,The weather is very bi-polar. It can be raining one minute and the next the sun is out and it is 75 degrees. It is the same with snow. It will be in the 60s for a week and then the next week it will be in the 20s.
College Sophomore,2,"They serve the same food almost every day/week. There is not much variety. Also, if you miss a meal you don't get to make it up later in the week and it is really expensive."
College Freshman,2,They are hard to get to.
College Sophomore,2,"the school tuition goes up, but the financial aid is not raised it stays the same , so I end up paying more."
College Sophomore,2,"I am currently still in an on-going battle with the financial aid office at my school.  They refuse to give me any sort of financial aid because my parents ""make too much money.""  I won't lie, my parents make a decent amount of money from working in the hospital, but they have a lot to pay for.  The school fails to understand that we live in New York, where living is ridiculously expensive, my parents have two other children to feed, my brother is involved in at least five programs that require payment, my sister is going to college this year, and my mother is currently taking college courses as well; there is no way we can afford to pay the absurd tuition that my university demands of me.  They still won't budge, however, and I am stuck working two jobs on campus while trying to balance between work and my studies."
College Sophomore,2,"Off-campus dining is rather pitiful.  The town that my university is located in has a population count of about 50 so there is nearly nothing to chose from.  However, in the town there is Otts, a bar that we all love and go to religiously, there is also a nicer restaurant and a pizza place.  There is also a McDonald's and a Pizza Hut within town.  These are pretty much your five options.  However, if you are willing to make the drive, Gettysburg is only 15 minutes away and there are endless food options there, or there is the town of Thurmont 15 minutes in the other direction which has just about every fast food chain your heart could desire.  There is also a little restaurant called The Shamrock, only about 5 minutes up the road.  Most students don't like to go there though because the KKK holds meetings every Friday night there (I still think their food is fantastic and their prices are decent).  Overall, off-campus dining isn't too great, but if you're willing to make the drive, you can find everything you're looking for."
College Sophomore,2,"The only transportation our university provides us with is a shuttle to the airport and a shuttle to nearby cities (Baltimore and Washington DC).  The airport shuttle is EXTREMELY expensive and is only available on the Friday before a break.  This can be very inconvenient because some students have class at the time that the shuttle leaves and have to cut class or find a different ride to the airport.  It is also drops you off hours before your flight departure time so you are often stuck waiting in the airport for at least four hours.  The shuttles to nearby cities are adequate.  The cost to utilize them is often very cheap, normally only $5 or $10.  You are usually given a decent amount of time to spend in the city before the shuttle leaves back to campus.  The only problem is that space is limited.  They only allow a certain amount of students to go on the trip and there is only ONE shuttle that departs.  The other problem is that these trips only occur once a semester, so you don't really get to go that often."
Recent Alumnus,2,I do not use this.
College Sophomore,2,There are not that many places to go.
College Sophomore,2,"Many students abuse drugs and alcohol on campus, but few get in trouble for doing so."
College Sophomore,2,There are not that many options.
College Sophomore,2,Not many people go to support
College Sophomore,2,"They tried more last year. Every week, it's the same bland food."
College Sophomore,2,There are minorities here but the do not all accept each other.
College Senior,2,Parking is far away for all classes. As a junior and senior it does improve but still difficult. The parking tickets are ridiculous.
College Sophomore,2,The people looks pretty average. People would dress in sweatpants and t-shirts most of the time. People would rarely dress up. There are a group of very interesting people who are different from the rest but they are weird.
College Senior,2,"Housing process is a nightmare but the housing itself is not too bad. The underclassmen probably have a worse experience because they are overcrowded, but the school has done its best to adjust"
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus housing is  by far and significantly cheaper than living on campus.  The only issue that would make off campus housing expensive is the food services. Those not living on campus do not purchase a meal plan, making food more expensive to buy ( also depending on how much the students collectively eat)."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather at this institution can be very unpredictable, usually ranging from cold in the morning, to warm or slightly sunny in the afternoon. Students usually dress in layers in the morning and remove articles of clothing later on in the day."
College Sophomore,2,I don't go off campus to eat because nothing is in walking distance. You must own a car or have a friend that has one because the nearest places are about 10-15 minutes away. And I don't think there are that many options.
College Sophomore,2,"There's not very many close places. If you want to eat off campus you need a car. Prices are okay, but for a decent place you have to drive at least 15-20 minutes. I love the school regardless."
College Freshman,2,"Nightlife is only available to people 21 or older.  Unless its the weekend in which case there is sometimes a party off campus.  There is a bar nearby, and there are school sponsored events in town like free bowling and whatnot, but honestly most weekends people leave campus and party elsewhere and those that don't leave tend to party in their dorms until public safety shows up."
Graduate Student,1,"Terrible place, terrible school in middle of nowhere, if you dont have a car you are literally locked on  campus, even if you do there is nothing to do around, farms and corn fields only. Cafeteria is the worst place ever, portions small, bad quality. Professors are kinda ok. Area is full of racists,they are driving around with CONFEDERATE FLAGS, dont recommend this place at all, for 50,000$ you can go to way better school."
Junior,1,"If you aren't an athlete you will be treated like trash. Resident life is a joke and has no clue what they are doing. The way the university operates is just terrible. There are numerous counts of vandalism that qualify as hate crimes that the Mount addresses poorly and in secret. I would transfer out but based on the core classes they require you to take, other universities would only count them as electives."
Niche User,1,"I was an athlete at MSMU for one year in 2014-2015. I did not have a very good experience my freshman year. One positive was the facilities, other than that, everything could use improvement. The students are stranded, with no food places open in walking distance other than the cafe (until 2am). Majority of the professors seem entitled. Part of the issue is it seems that the school only hires alumni. Which is good but they all seem to be the same types of people."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life
College Freshman,1,There isn't much of a night life.
College Sophomore,1,"I wouldn't recommend going here if you want a real college atmosphere, it felt like high school all over again. It seems that if you aren't on one of the Collegiate sport teams you aren't normal. Everyone is in cliques just like high school and it was not a good experience at all."
College Sophomore,1,"There is basically nowhere good to go to eat off campus. People go to Ott's but mostly to drink; the food is just mediocre. There's a McDonalds and a Pizza Hut but that's basically it. I know a lot of people like it but I hate Simply Asia. I only had it once and it was awful. I wish there were more options closer or even vendors on campus, even just a Starbucks. I'm honestly kind of surprised their isn't more; I understand the summer would be a liability but if someone put, say, a Chipotle right in Emmitsburg they would make a killing. If you want something you need to go to Gettysburg (15+ minutes), Frederick or Westminster (25+ minutes)."
College Freshman,1,Pizza hut and sheetz are the only places to get food after a 8 PM and maybe Otts if your 21.
College Freshman,1,We are treated like children.  The disregard the fact that we are all 18 and older therefore legally adults however guys and girls are not allowed to be on the same floor past 12 AM weekdays and 2 AM weekends.  It is a stupid rule.
College Junior,1,There is no party scene.
College Junior,1,Bored kids with lots of booze
College Sophomore,1,Greek life does not exist at the mount. Disregard my answers above...
College Sophomore,1,happens for like 2-3 hrs then cops break it up
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greeks on campus.
College Sophomore,1,There's a Greek life at the Mount?!
College Sophomore,1,There is NO public transportation and NOTHING around to do.
College Sophomore,1,Biology seems to be the hardest major here.
College Sophomore,1,They try to ticket you more than once in less than 12 hours
College Sophomore,1,They try to give students the maximum penalty for first offenses.
College Sophomore,1,You must have a car to go off campus
College Sophomore,1,"Mount St. Marys is a very isolated university. The extent of our ""Nightlife"" is drinking and hanging out in an apartment or a sport house. Even those get bust pretty early because the campus is small making it easy for public safety to stop party before they get to wild."
College Senior,1,Emmitsburg has nothing to offer. It is old town that the only thing that keeps it alive is the mount.
College Sophomore,1,There's not really anywhere off campus to live unless you're a commuter.
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely nothing to do here. I heard a few years ago this was actually a fun place but it has gone seriously downhill. You walk outside on a weekend night and the whole campus is completely silent. Not even the apartments have anything going on that much anymore. They have a club but its probably the worst club ever. There is nothing to do here. At all.
College Freshman,1,The computers are archaic and take about 2 hours just to turn on. The network is infamously slow and is the joke on campus. It takes an average of 15 minutes to watch a 3 minute YouTube video here.
College Freshman,1,"The security is, quite plainly, a bunch of assholes. They violate student rights and conduct unprecedented room searches. Rapists and junkies are allowed to roam freely on campus but if you happen to be anywhere where there's music or underage drinking Public Safety busts you and reads you the riot act. I heard this school used to be fun until campus security cracked down and forced everyone to lock themselves in their rooms and drink by themselves until they die."
College Freshman,1,"Nightlife isn't that great at Msm. Unless you like going out with the same people every single weekend it isnt fun. Also, public safety is really strict and they always catch a bunch of underage people every weekend. I like to meet new people all the time so I mainly spend my weekends at other colleges."
College Freshman,1,"Unless you live in the apartments (Juniors/Seniors) or are part of a sports teams that has houses off campus, the nightlight at Mount St. Mary's is non-existent. This is in NO WAY shape or form a party school, and frankly, a generally dull place on the weekends."
College Freshman,1,"None. If you want food you'll need a car to drive into Emmitsburg. This is especially annoying as the only place to get food on campus is the dining hall and the ""Mount Cafe"" which is essentially dining hall food available when the dining hall is closed."
College Freshman,1,"Make sure you come to this school for the right reasons. Mount St. Mary's University is a SMALL, RURAL, PRIVATE, CATHOLIC University. It may seem obvious but its important to think about the environment in which you'll be living and learning in. This is not a school for everyone. I personally find it very boring. There are many days in which I feel trapped, due to its extremely rural setting with essentially nothing but the dining hall, library, classrooms, and dorms within walking distance. The town of Emmitsburg - a car drive away - is also very small with little to do. It is far from a college town."
College Junior,1,The school is on the Cacoctin Mountain Range.  The surrounding area is mostly farmland.
College Junior,1,"There is not much at all to do.  This coming form someone who loves this university.  If nightlife is important to you then this is NOT your school.  There is a ""club"" on campus (1808) but many times I hear that the DJs are poor and that scene was below average."
College Freshman,1,Zero Greek life at Mount St. Mary's
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing Really Around – Public transportation around the Emmitsburg campus in incredibly poor. It is in a very rural area and is literally located on Route 15.  No public buses near, and very few shuttles offered by the school throughout the year."
Recent Alumnus,1,"On Campus Is the Way to Go. There is not a variety of off-campus housing. Mostly students prefer to live on campus. There are apartments on campus owned by the university. This gives students who are rising juniors or seniors the opportunity to experience living in an apartment. I am a rising junior and will be living in a apartment on campus as opposed to living in a dorm room. Since our campus is in a secluded area, I believe it's best to live on campus. The apartments and dorms on campus are worth the pay."
College Junior,1,"Most colleges do have restrictions for parking. The Mount takes it to the extreme though. The campus is small, so it is a ""walking campus"", but many students do have their cars. Everyone is assigned a lot, but there may be instances where you need to have your car near your dorm. The campus is in a rural area and there are tons of vacant parking spaces/ even lots all the time. PS is a little rediculous about fining you if you are parked in one, even if its for 5 minutes. They just have nothing better to do. Again, I would understand if parking was limited. But its not!"
College Freshman,1,"Does not exsist. There isn't any greek life on campus. But with the behavior of the Men's lacrosse team, you might think they are a fraternity. "
College Freshman,1,"My overall experience at the Mount was on average, pretty horrible. The campus is very beautiful and the academics are great, but as far as the ""college experience"", this is more like an extended high school. I wouldn't recommend that anyone who wants a college experience go here."
College Freshman,1,"What Night Life? There is absolutely NO night life on this campus, unless you count the University run ""night club"" that is open for about 2 hours. Most ""parties"" happen in the apartments, which are crowded and smell HORRIBLE. Most of them are broken up within 30 minutes."
College Sophomore,1,"Laid Back at Best – The social scene at the Mount is generally sports team related. The parties are either at off campus houses or in on campus apartments. They usually aren't that fun unless you are on the team throwing the party. Other than the sports teams and their followers, noone really parties. They might play monopoly or halo in the dorm room on a Friday night ."

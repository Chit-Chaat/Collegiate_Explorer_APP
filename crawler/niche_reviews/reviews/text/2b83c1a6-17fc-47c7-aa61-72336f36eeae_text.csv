Graduate Student,5,"I'm in my first semester of an accelerated online program with Southeastern Oklahoma State University to complete a Master of Education, Educational Leadership degree. The staff members that I've come into contact with have been extremely helpful with prompt responses, accessibility, & have shown professionalism. I am grateful to choose this institution of higher learning."
Graduate Student,5,Affordable University and they have the accelerated Masters Program available online that I was looking for. The Faculty and Staff are amazing are ready to help when its needed.
Senior,5,"I love the atmosphere of SOSU. It is a great place to go if you don't want to go to a huge school, but it is big enough to feel like you have room to grow. I would recommend it to everyone."
Freshman,5,Since I have dealt with a million or what seems like a million of collegers that have talked to me int he last few days Southeatern Oklahoma State University had been very sincere and extrely professional.
Graduate Student,5,I am a new graduate student at SOSU and I am very impressed by the amount of communication I have received from the advisors and success coaches. I do not like that the orientation is drawn out and there is little in the way of guidance with it (outside of orientation itself).
Graduate Student,5,I have had a great experience throughout my educational attainment from Southeastern. The faculty has been very supportive and often contacts me just to check in on me to make sure my studies are on target.
Graduate Student,5,I've currently been online with SOSU and so far everything has been great. With being a graduate student online communication is through email. Responses from professors are in a sufficient time frame.  I'm glad I choose this University to continue my education.
Niche User,5,South Eastern is a great school with a great flight school as well as safety program. The town Durant is great as well as the neighboring city Sherman and denison
Graduate Student,5,"I received my bachelor's degree in the 1990s and have now returned to complete my graduate degree. I love the people at SOSU-the staff, faculty, other students are wonderful and make the difference in your experience. It's a beautiful campus and some buildings are not as updated as others but I love the history of those building."
Sophomore,5,"I like the classes, and the dorms. They are better to be around, and help keep me focused on why I am here. The only thing I would change would be the cafeteria food. Normally it is not the best, it is edible but a lot of the time it make me sick and messes with my stomach personally."
Freshman,5,"It feels like home! The professors get to know you, and truly care about your well-being. Everyone knows everyone, and it’s hard to not make friends. Overall a LOVELY experience!"
Niche User,5,"Great small campus, I enjoy the community and would love to go back! Has a very good aviation program and education system. The town is small and sweet but still has everything you need. Also is not far from a big town."
Sophomore,5,Excellent atmosphere. The professors work with you and respond quickly. The campus is pretty and they keep students updated on weather and any cancellations.
Niche User,5,I am a High school senior who takes concurrent classes at this University and I love it there. The professors are very down to earth and care about you. The size of the University make me feel very comfortable while navigating to my next class.
Freshman,5,"Though I have not begun school, I have visited more than once and the scenery at Southeastern is very beautiful and the people and staff are super friendly. Southeastern is a very good school in my opinion and I do not regret choosing Southeastern Oklahoma State University as my new home."
Senior,5,"I enjoyed attending Southeastern Oklahoma State University at the Campus in Idabel, Oklahoma. I have had some good times and have enjoyed all of my classes and especially all the new friends that I have made. I have enjoyed all of the teaching staff, they have taught me a lot. I returned to College after being out of school for 35 years. It is a Great Experience."
Sophomore,5,I like southeastern because it allows me to live at home and work but also be a full time student without going every single day! The only thing I would change is the food. It’s not bad but after a while it gets old and it is just the same food all the time.
Senior,5,I like SE because everyone is very nice. The people who work there are very helpful when you don't know something. The professors are well educated so they are able to teach young people what they need to know. The college allows options for all students. The classes are well organized and prepared too. This college is the best!
Sophomore,5,Great college! The instructors are nice and will work with you. The advisors are great with helping you find the classes you'll need for your major. If you apply late they will still try to get you in the school and in classes. Any office is happy to help anyone that is lost and well help tell where you need to go. It is a nice campus and its not too big. The buildings are mostly close together. Its not difficulty to find your classes.
Freshman,5,"This University is very friendly, they welcome you with open arms and care about your true well being. Its a fun campus to live on, they always have activities going on and always try to involve the students in them. The education is spot on and I promise you, you will learn something new everyday."
Graduate Student,5,I have had a great experience.  My advisors are straight forward and keep me in line and on course.  The instructors are caring and make sure all students are squared away.  The classes are flexible and easy to pick up later if I miss one and have to come back to it.
Freshman,5,There are many things I like about Southeastern Oklahoma State University. The people are all so friendly and very helpful if you don't know where you are going. The staff there is very patient and is always willing to help you get what you need in the quickest way possible.  The professors are really good with their students and want the best learning experience possible.
Freshman,5,"I love this school. This is a very accepting environment and it is very loving. The staff is very sweet and lovely to work with, the professors are very nice and forgiving. The campus stays very clean and very safe. I feel safe walking alone or to be alone, and the campus PD do a very good job at keeping it that way. The food is good and nourishing."
Niche User,5,"If you live anywhere near Durant Oklahoma and haven't decided where to go to college this is the right pick for everybody. Southeastern, also known as ""Southeasy"" is the perfect pick for anybody not wanting to be to far from home or friends, because odds are most of the people you graduated with are there too whether you like it or not. Southeastern a high school experience with a college degree. it doesn't get much better than that."
College Senior,5,"I am an older (45) returning student who finds college much harder now than when I was younger.  Due to life restraints I found myself unable to complete my degree when I was younger.  I took an 8 week Ogle Beauty School course and became a nail specialist.  At the time, I thought that would be my part-time career while I completed college.  It is now 24 years later and my nail specialist career has served me very well.  It allowed me to raise my son as a single mother and see him graduate from high school in 2013, work full time at an insurance company, and now be enrolled full time in college.  I am extremely proud of that accomplishment, as he is a fine young man and a productive member of society.  Since he is now on his own, I can concentrate on completing my Bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences.  I would very much like to teach special needs children in the lower grades."
College Junior,5,There is a lot of opportunities on campus for internships an jobs.
College Junior,5,The classes are well organized an very informative.
College Junior,5,"The safety on campus is excellent! The campus police are there for you whenever you need them. There's also buttons all over campus that calls the campus police to your location if you need help, ride, ect."
College Junior,5,They're very nice and clean and at a great price
College Junior,5,The sports are great and fun to be in
College Junior,5,It's very informative an fun. Everyone is so nice an helpful.
College Freshman,5,Our  School provides workshop in online activities to complete every semester for sexual violence or even emotional violence .
College Freshman,5,"My class sizes are prefect, there are not to many people in them however there is  enough to be diverse. My teachers are all hard workers and do their jobs to the beat of the ability."
College Freshman,5,"Our school  strives to perfection in all it's courses and is big on Diversty weather that is from alumni or students,  our programs are helpful and resource full in whatever our needs are ."
College Student,5,Campus PD makes me feel safe and they are there whenever I have a concern.
College Student,5,They are very helpful and caring.
College Student,5,Class sizes are awesome and there is lots of time for one on one help
College Student,5,The wellness center has great opportunities. Their staff is so nice and helpful
College Student,5,This school is the best  decision of my life.  The teachers are helpful And caring.  I have financial struglgles so I love that's it's affordable for the most part. I still struggle but not near as much as I would at any other college.
College Freshman,5,My time here has been great. The teachers genuinely care about me and whether or not I am doing the right things in order to graduate. There are plenty of activities on campus to do as well as around the area.
College Sophomore,5,"The classes I have taken so far have been challenging, forcing me to think outside the box to make the grade. It's not just more memorize and repeat on a test. It's conceptualize and apply to real world applications."
College Sophomore,5,The college goes above and beyond to maintain a safe campus environment.
College Freshman,5,The professors are really helpful and care a lot about each student.
College Freshman,5,Everyone I have meet so far is extremely nice and they are willing to help me with anything.
College Freshman,5,"The dorms and Southeastern are very good some the residents that live in the dorms are nice, some not so nice but that did not stop me from having a fun time as a freshman! There is a building called BCM and its a Christian building where we have church and women and me ministry where you can met very nice and caring people. I've met a lot of my friends though BCM. The cost is pretty good, some things I personally think they should not charge because we do pay a lot to attend school and live there. But I guess they have to make money too. The housing is good too like all universities you can get the expensive or cheap dorms, the cheap dorms are not bad , I lived in the cheap dorms because I do not like spending a lot of money.  So far I've like some of my teachers, I'm going into Nursing so my classes have been hard. But what I've heard from other students their classes have been fairly easy. If you ever need help the advisers are the nicest people you can met, they know the hard classes and teachers and they try to help you out by that because they know how stressful college can be. I would encourage anyone to attend this University."
College Freshman,5,The security on campus is great. They're always out and making sure everything is safe. There has been security measures set up around campus to ensure the safety for our residents.
College Freshman,5,Being involved in my program can be time consuming but it worth it. I will do anything for an education and to make my parents proud.
College Freshman,5,"The dorms are very cozy and very nice.  the social atmosphere is great, there is a lot of friendly people around campus.  the prices are also reasonable compared to other colleges."
College Freshman,5,"My fraternity (S?G) is the best in the world.. But now that that's out of my system, I honestly love greek life, everyone gets along with everyone whether they're greek or not. I love being greek, even though I'm a freshman, I can tell everything is going to go great."
College Sophomore,5,wide range of study options
College Sophomore,5,"Very safe, there is lights every where and you should never be scare of go by your self."
College Sophomore,5,"Our athletics are very good. Everyone takes taker of our athlets and we care about them.

They make our school look really good, and which way is better than having a healthy life by doing sports."
College Sophomore,5,We do not have a lot of extreme weather problems here in the Texoma region.
College Sophomore,5,There are no drugs used on campus tobacco isnt even allowed
College Sophomore,5,Most of the places are very clean and well taken care of
College Freshman,5,I love most of my teachers. They are down to earth and awesome.
College Freshman,5,I am in an honors program and housed with a lot of other honor students. 
College Freshman,5,The faculty actually get to know the students by name. The campus is a smaller campus which I love being a part of and not just another body lost in the crowd. I love the friends I have made and study groups we have.
College Freshman,5,The guys are really friendly and fun to hang out with.
College Freshman,5,It's a small campus and everyone is friendly and says hi when passing. The dorm life is the best.
Junior,4,It's a great school and the professors are really nice and helpful. I love how involved the students are here on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Southeastern is a great school if you're looking for a smaller, more at home feel. Because of the small class sizes, the professors generally are able to learn your name and get to know you personally. It's dorms aren't the best, but the people you meet and the scenery around campus more than makes up for it. The food is pretty good most of the time, and if the cafeteria doesn't have something you like, you can go over to the cafe in the same building and order what you want."
Sophomore,4,The instructors truly care and want their students to succeed. They're even willing to work with students outside of class. The classes have useful knowledge and practical applications to the content of the lessons. There're plenty of organizations and clubs to join and find just the right fit. The safety is great with caring campus police and safety buttons in certain areas.
Senior,4,"I love the atmosphere it has,however, I would like to see the dorms look a little bettter. Other wise it's a good town with plenty to do!"
Junior,4,"I like that the education department has a Project Teach that helps this major, but I think there should be more programs to help other students in their fields."
Niche User,4,"So far, I've got to go on two tours of the campus and speak with a few of the students there and overall it's a very friendly and interesting place."
Graduate Student,4,Outstanding online value. Have taken graduate classes with multiple schools and this is far and away the best one.
Freshman,4,"Has very good academics and very friendly and helpful staff. Although it is not as expensive as other colleges, the academics have exceeded my expectations."
Graduate Student,4,"In October I began the online Masters of Education Administration program.  This is my first experience with online classes and I have been pleased with the class.  I appreciate the flexibility of the online program.  The content is relevant and rigorous, yet manageable for someone teaching full time.  The professor was available for questions.  For the most part the university employees are helpful and responsive although at times there is a lag in communication between various offices.  I would recommend this program."
Junior,4,Southeastern is a great school. Most of the instructors are friendly and they are always willing to help. Its easy to make friends and living on campus is pleasant.
Senior,4,"Although it isn't the most exciting area, you learn a lot and gain insights on your major. As a Psych major I am very happy with my experience and will be a little sad to leave so many great professors."
Junior,4,Very helpful professors! Students are a like minded and all usually get a long! Everybody is very friendly!
Junior,4,Very good programs and overall great staff who are ready and willing to help. Systems are fairly easy to use and campus is nice and open to even online only students for a quiet place to study.
Niche User,4,The campus is a very beautiful campus. The professors are great people  The party scene could use some work. I think it will be a perfect fit for so many people .
Niche User,4,I have taken concurrent classes through this school and have completed them successfully. The professors are helpful and very knowledgeable in their feilds.
Junior,4,"Overall, SE has been a good place to be. It is overall affordable and with this you get personal time with professors and have a small community to work with. They have lots of different degree options and provide many opportunities for students to get involved."
Niche User,4,"It's not the best, but I recommend going there. It has a great sports program. Everyone is nice and outgoing there."
Junior,4,"Great professors! They're very attentive and helpful. Student life is okay, they could do better. Not very diverse. Not a party school whatsoever. Overall, pretty good school."
Freshman,4,"I like the fact that the campus is small enough to  travel by foot from one end to the other.  The teacher to student ratio is small enough to have an intimate learning experience.  Some of the dormitory buildings are rather old, but are spacious and adequate.  The new dormitory buildings are an excellent home away from home.  I am loving my ""college freshman"" experience."
Freshman,4,"Southeastern Oklahoma State University is a school that is all about small communities. I would like to change the student life at Southeastern, make it a fun place and have a lot of student involvement. I want it to be a place where people desire to go and have different opportunities to be involved.  "
Recent Alumnus,4,Safety and security on campus is great!
Recent Alumnus,4,Admissions and advisors was great!
Recent Alumnus,4,Great advisors and teaching staff. All of the classes that I have taken easily apply to my current job position.
College Senior,4,HAVEN is an online video with quiz that is required for all students to review before enrollment is finalized.
College Senior,4,"This school has an excellent history of producing highly recommended teachers. In many cases, a student's pre-teaching semester often lands them a job in the school they chose to conduct student teaching."
College Senior,4,"I chose Southeastern Oklahoma State University for its Education Department. The main campus is located an hour from my home, but their remote locations made earning my degree possible. I can attend a local outreach campus or study online. Whether learning in a classroom, through ITV, or online I know I can always approach my instructors with questions. I also enjoy my group of peers. We have various ages and backgrounds, but there is a unity in our love for learning."
College Sophomore,4,So far I've had a great uplifting experience. The teachers overall have been helpful in my success. They have worked great with my schedule as a part time student. I would choose my school again if given the chance.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy this college.  My mom and sister went to it as well.
College Freshman,4,A lot of students go to SOSU because of the sports.  The softball team won the state championship I think.
College Freshman,4,The English classes are great.  I really enjoyed my time with Dr. Shires.  She made me change my major back to English because she showed me how much I actually enjoy it.
College Student,4,It is a good opportunity for people to find people with the same interest and they make everyone feel welcome.
College Freshman,4,I feel completely safe here. I know that this is a good place to be and if I need help it is always there for me.
College Freshman,4,I believe that I will have a good chance at excelling with the degree I earn from this school.
College Freshman,4,"Again, the professors are very hands on and care about what you are making and if you are being successful. They tell you like it is and are preparing you for the future."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are all very close to classes and have pretty much the same amenities throughout each building. There are some places that are better then others, but overall the atmosphere is the same."
College Freshman,4,Football games are a big part of campus life. People are greatly encouraged to come out and have a good time. There are great facilities in the union that allow other to participate even if they aren't on the team.
College Sophomore,4,"The degrees offered are largely in demand, but the local area employment options are often limited. If a student is not limited by other considerations, there are many options for internships farther afield."
College Sophomore,4,This college works very well for non-traditional students.
College Sophomore,4,students that have taken athletics courses say they are excellent. I have not taken athletics courses so have no knowledge on experience on the subject.
College Freshman,4,If you're on campus you can expect to be safe. Off campus is where you should be careful.
College Freshman,4,Its extremely easy to get around the classes are so close together its no hassle at all.
College Freshman,4,Southeastern Oklahoma State University is a great school. The campus is beautiful and easy to get around. The classes are great. The professors really seem to care about their students. I would recommend this school to anyone who wanted to attend college.
College Junior,4,I love all my classes and I am learning a lot. Being a part of the softball team has helped me meet new friends and not be so shy.
College Student,4,I saw a good number of places that students can go to. I don't think they offer student discounts but I do know that the food is good and at a reasonable price.
College Student,4,It took a bit to figure it out but once I did it was very simple. All I had to do was add the school and they took care of the rest. Simple as that.
College Freshman,4,"Football is the biggest sport that everybody goes to, it's very fun it's hard not to miss a game! Basketball is the 2nd biggest sport although you do not see as many people as you do at the football games. The Basketball team is really great and fun at half time they have games where you can win money, and pizza."
College Freshman,4,"You have a lot of options for food. There's a lot of fast food places some do student discounts, all the restaurants do student discounts theirs a chili's, IHOP, Khans Fire, and Mexican restaurants."
College Freshman,4,The campus police are strict they are always patrolling the campus and they do rounds every hour in the dorm buildings to make sure everything's okay.
College Student,4,We our proud of SOSU sports.
College Student,4,The rules are for the safety of students.
College Student,4,Very pleased with my room choice.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is great no only do you get the experience but you also interact with your peers.
College Freshman,4,Its a small town and very quite and peaceful especially at crack of dawn.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics at are school is everything, they're a big part of campus life. Student life can attest to that."
College Freshman,4,"There are numerous amount of apartments on campus, there very reasonable as far as pricing."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy my teachers they challenge me and also explains and teach in a way I understand
College Sophomore,4,most degrees attainable through this university are respected and highly valued
College Sophomore,4,"Without good grades our life on college wouldnt have sense. 

Everyone has good grades, and who ever doesnt, at least they try.

Specially athlets, they are they ones that have to put more effort into it, after season, they have to keep fighting to finish strong."
College Sophomore,4,No complaints. It's pretty well lit.
College Sophomore,4,We seriously have so many students of all different ethnicity. It's great to get to know people from all over and from different backgrounds.
Senior,2,"My overall experience at Southeastern is been somewhat average if it wasn't for the business office people that are rude, impudent, and unhelpful. All they care is about money, they don't care if they slam you with useless fees. Worst; where all the funding goes? The school architect is old and needs an update, student service is no good, food sucks. overall, the only good are some proff. care about their student well being, and other could careless."
College Sophomore,2,proffessors are not very lenient or understanding
College Sophomore,2,not many healthy options. closes too early
College Sophomore,2,there are not very many attractive women on campus at all. most are your basic stuck up girls who'm go for only fraternity idiots.
College Sophomore,2,Our Greek-life is pretty much non existent in my opinion. I almost feel as if we don't even have any.
College Sophomore,2,Any ice causes us to not have classes because we have plenty of offsite folks.
College Sophomore,2,It's a small town with not much near by and little to no activities to do outside of class.
College Sophomore,2,There is not much to do around town. Only bars are at the casino and are overpriced. No movie theater or activity places near by
College Junior,2,"There's pretty much no nightlife in my school's town.  There is one club/bar that is about 10 minutes away, but I don't think that it is fun at all.  There's not even a movie theater or bowling alley here. "
College Sophomore,2,there is barly any long distance transportation
College Junior,2,First of all if you are going to be a music major at all you will need to expect to be in school for at least five to six years and have problems with exceeding credit hours. To try and meet all music requirements and education requirements at the same time is near impossible.
College Junior,2,There is nothing to do here in Durant except get in trouble or drive far to go to work.
College Junior,2,"As a music major I've had to walk many times at night to go practice by myself. My first semester, there were a total of four sexual assaults and one was in my dorm building in the elevator, and another was right outside the math building where it is an unlit area. The campus installed some lights and red emergency buttons, but if you are attacked and a female there is no way to make it to a button that takes at least 5 minutes for someone to respond to."
College Junior,2,The football players have actually been aloud on the field while partially drunk. The only reason a few members have been kicked for drugs is because they got caught by actual police. (not campus police)
College Junior,2,"The dorms used to be barracks back when the campus was a military base. They have added a newer dorm building, but they are overly priced for the quality. The only good thing is that they are very close to your classes so waking up 5 minutes till you can still make it to your classes on time."
College Junior,2,"Usual fast food places like Taco Bell, McDonalds, Jack-in-the-Box, and they hardly have any student discounts. Almost always will get your order wrong! "
College Junior,2,Marching band practices on 180 deg turf. NO MERCY!
College Sophomore,2,"Limited since I attend a satellite campus, but they try their best to be accommodating. "
College Sophomore,2,"The application process is completely online, but once accepted my adviser was very helpful and went over my needed criteria as a transfer student.  My motto is not to be afraid to ask questions!"
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not familiar with any other financial aid processes, but I've had stressful experience trying to figure it out.  I have had to call and go online, back and forth several times.  They were always wanting yet another document sent, form filled out, fax resent, and just when I thought I was done I had to write an appeal letter.  The financial aid director was denying my aid because a seven year prior withdraw from a former school.  I had to explain why I had to withdraw, and how I planned to succeed today.  It then took almost three weeks to hear if my letter was approved or not so that I could enroll.  I can honestly say that without prayer, my financial aid experience may have been enough to discourage me from continuing, but I'm pressing forward and am determined to graduate!"
Sophomore,1,"The people here are very judgmental. Some of the professors enjoy teaching while there are some that act like they do not want to be there. The staff here has no clue what they are talking about. The nurse misdiagnoses people all the time. I was misdiagnosed twice. The food here makes you sick, I lost 20 pounds my freshman year here."
Freshman,1,"I live in Shearer Hall and the RA does nothing.  There is loud music, they know there is drinking in the dorm and nothing is done, they tell the students a couple days in advance before an inspection so they can get all of the liquor of our there rooms.  If you are going to this school to learn you will need to live off campus.  For $2500 a semester it is not worth the trouble, lack of sleep and substandard living quarters.  Don't do a sport there either, the coaching staff are very poor."
College Sophomore,1,Drugs aren't too apparent on campus.
College Junior,1,"The professors don't think that you have a life when you are a music major. I feel like a slave and they make things mandatory so you will need to find a flexible job and a nice boss to compensate and work with your headache of a major.
"
College Junior,1,"This school is all about the run around. I would not choose to go to this school again if I could go back and know what I did now. I suggest getting a degree at an accredited on-line school. Less headache and more on your own terms. You literally get to pick the exact classes you want, no extra."
College Junior,1,"There are no clubs or places to go at night for fun unless one wanted to drive all the way to Dallas, and people actually do. The campus does have an after-hours type of party, but the same people are the only ones that go to that (the RA's who are required to be there)."
College Junior,1,I think the only group of people that do well at this school are the aviation team and select individuals that go try out for collegiate ensembles in the music department.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Getting everything together for financial aid was hard, this school doesn't seem like it wanted to help"
College Junior,1,"There's only one place to go to one night a week for ""College Night"" it's mediocre. The drinks are reasonable (if you're over 21) but it could easily get boring. I have more fun with a girls night & wine."
College Junior,1,"No local shuttle service at all, there is a regional bus company that will take students (for a fee) to a town 25 miles away for shopping, movies, etc."
College Senior,1,"There used to be one small nightclub, but it closed down."
College Junior,1,Not Good – The cafeteria on campus is awful! It definitely taste like cafeteria food. I suggest not getting a food plan if you can get around not having one.
College Junior,1,"I was a transfer student at SOSU, and I only spent half my first semester there in the dorms before I moved out. The rooms were set up in a suit style (4 people, 2 rooms, and a shared bathroom.) I never met the people in the second room, and never met anyone else on my floor. And not only did I not feel comfortable, and at home here, I did not feel welcome by any of the residents that I did come into contact with.

After all that I experienced in the resident life at SOSU, I would not recommend anyone live on campus."
College Freshman,1,"i dont participate in drugs and alcohol, but of course i know people who do, and as far as campus police go with it, i have not heard of many students being caught with any of that here. however i do know finding of them on campus can have pretty severe punishments such as termination of your financial aid, as well as dismisal from school, or suspended from school and having finds and court cases, and possibly community service depending on the severity of the issue. off campus police will not tolerate at all the drinking and driving in this area, and most of the cops know whre alll of the drinking spots drug spots and drag races go so the cities is not very tolerant after so long. as far as it affecting social lives, it can definately cause the students to drop academically, ultimately making themselves lose scholarship, financial aid, and termination from the course program, without them ever getting caught by an official. many students dont make it after the first semester of their freshmen year to due the overwhelming availability, and overuse of the alcolhol and drugs."

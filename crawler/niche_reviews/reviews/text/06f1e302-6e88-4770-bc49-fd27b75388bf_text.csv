Sophomore,5,Nice lively school. Excellent class/degree options. Many campus life opportunities. Great location. Great advising people.
Alum,5,I only had a couple classes online but my professors were engaged and very responsive.  They responded quickly abs cared for me as a student.
Alum,5,"UWG is the best kept secret in GA!  If you’re looking for a midsized institution where you matter, then you need to Go West.  From day 1 stepping on campus the faculty and staff cared for me.  I was able to get involved in in organizations that mattered, and found mentors and plenty of friends who cared for me.  I am so happy I chose UWG and it was a decision that changed my life for the better. And academics, with top rated education, nursing, and business programs and stellar arts, political science, and sciences, you can’t go wrong.  Go West! You’ll be so happy you did."
Alum,5,"The University of West Georgia provided an exceptional 4-year on campus undergraduate experience, allowing me to thrive in both coursework and in the greater West Georgia community.  The faculty and staff want students to be successful."
Alum,5,"I took some hybrid online-in person classes during my time on campus.  It was challenging, as I prefer in-person, but I learned a lot about the subject matter and still use those lessons in my professional life."
Alum,5,"UWG is an amazing school with amazing experiences. The institution itself is very forward thinking, while the faculty and staff truly care about you. UWG is a very hands on university. I'm SO glad I chose UWG!!"
Alum,5,"I got my undergraduate degree mainly on campus, however, I took several online courses. UWG Online is very supportive and have extremely caring staff!"
Freshman,5,This is my first week of school.  I am glad I chose to attend University of West Georgia to pursue nursing. The campus provides a friendly environment.
Sophomore,5,Yes I took many classes online during the corona virus pandemic. The professors adjusted very well to online learning and were always quick to answer emails since we did not have “office hours” to ask questions.
Sophomore,5,I love everything about West Georgia. This was my top college choice and it has lived up to every expectation I had for it.
Freshman,5,Classes were simple and very engaging. Professors were very understanding. The diversity is very abroad. I met a lot of different people.
Freshman,5,I would like to tell others that west georgia is a great school to attend. The cultural diversity is real huge at this school. It is a good environment to be in.
Freshman,5,"The online orientation is very engaging, considering it is the only thing I've done online so far. I cannot wait to participate in UWG's online experiences."
Freshman,5,"Although I haven't started my Freshman year at UWG, my mother, auntie, and both of my uncles went to UWG. I have also heard many great things about the school."
Senior,5,"Online classes through West Georgia are phenomenal. All of the professors are great about having a schedule and sticking to it. Most online classes have due dates posted the first day, which makes it easier to plan when I will get my assignments completed. Professors are always available through email and have never had a problem explaining something more than once. I hated online classes at my community college, but West Georgia changed that for me."
Freshman,5,"i haven't started classes yet, but i think  i would love it .because u heard the teachers are very good in what they do and make sure the students understand what they are learning ."
Freshman,5,"i am just a freshman to this university , and so far i think this college is the best everyone is very friendly and helpful , they reply to your questions quickly and make sure you understand and aren't confused at all, they are  the best."
Alum,5,Online learning is made simple and the professors which teach online classes care about every students education.
Freshman,5,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have taken some of my courses online as we have been advised to social distance from each other. I have been able to be in contact with teachers and students in need of help over an assignment or other school-related activities. Even though I did prefer the face-to-face interactions with the professors, faculty, and students during the school year, I was still able to be worry-free when it comes to teaching out to others for help or even submitting assignments and projects. I believe West Georgia has a great online experience that comes in handy at times such as this."
Alum,5,Throughout college I took face to face classes as well as online. I enjoyed both! Professors provided you with everything you needed to ensure a successful online experience.
Alum,5,I had a great experience at the University of West Georgia! It provided me with many opportunities to be a part of things on and off of campus.
Alum,5,The teachers who teach online classes are so dedicated to making sure you don't miss out on anything by being online instead of in person.
Alum,5,Almost every teacher I had worked as hard as they could to make sure we got what we needed out of the class and the experience. I took mostly online classes but my teachers would respond late and on weekends for the most part to make sure we felt supported. I felt like I learned more than I had in previous schools and I had a wonderful experience.
Junior,5,"I like the campus, it's small enough to walk around the whole thing but large enough to need shuttle service. There is always someone around that can help you."
Niche User,5,"My experience with University of West Georgia is through dual enrollment. The online professors are very kind and understandable. The campus is also very nice. Overall, UWG is a great college."
Niche User,5,"I am a current dual enrollment student at UWG and will be attending in the fall. They have helped me start off my college journey early and be able to complete core classes, so that when I start in the fall I am ahead of the game. The professors are great and all of the staff is friendly."
Sophomore,5,Its a pretty good school. The overall environment and experience is nice and well organized. They provide opportunities for students to get involved and make it convenient and comfortable for everyone.
Niche User,5,It was Clean and the staff is very friendly.The students are very active in there sports.The academics are also very excellent they know there profession very well.
Niche User,5,"I am currently enrolled at University of West Georgia at the Newnan campus as a dual enrolled student and I cannot say one bad thing about the building, professors, or staff members. Everyone there is always happy to help and makes you feel less exposed to a new university and more like a place you would have known your whole life. The classes here have a decent amount of people, but the big classrooms help with that. Everything from the floors, to the bathrooms, to the snack area in this building is as clean as ever. This school is great if you want to transition into a big university at you own time, because you can transfer your classes from the Newnan campus to the Carrollton campus"
Niche User,5,They are a very clean and organized school. They are very nice and do not take long to respond to applications among other things. I would highly recommend this school to people who are interested in the majors they have to offer.
Senior,5,I overall enjoyed my experience here at West Ga. The school is very diverse and inclusive to all people. They are also very equipped with professionals and systems in place to help students succeed.
Freshman,5,This is my first year at University of West Georgia. There are always games and events to go to especially at the beginning of the year. The middle of the year there aren't as many events to go to on the weekends but having friends on campus can make the weekends better.  There are many options for food here. Between the two dining halls Z-6 is the best one.
Junior,5,West Georgia is a family environment that makes you feel like you are at home. I wouldn't change a thing.
Junior,5,I am currently attending the University of West Georgia. My experience at this university has been extremely positive. All of the professors and instructors care for their students. Professors are easy to reach and to meet with. The facilities are outstanding. The gym membership that is given once accepted to the university is helpful for students' health.
Freshman,5,"Being an international student, I was looking for a school that would help with the transition. West Georgia has been my home away from home. They have embraced and loved me and allowed me to strive and achieve what I need for my degree."
Freshman,5,"It is a very good school, in a safe community, the professors are always great to work with and love to help."
Freshman,5,My experience so far at UWG is one very pleasing. I have had the opportunity to work closely with people and learn about how others operate differently than me.
Sophomore,5,I really like how there is a campus close by so that I do not have drive a long distance to take my classes. I also enjoy the overall atmosphere the campus has; everyone there is more than ready to help you out in any way possible. The classes directly relate to the major I studying and are fairly easy. The professors respond to emails very quickly as well and will help you out if you have any problems. Overall the University of West Georgia is a really enjoyable college that I greatly recommend.
Sophomore,5,"Overall The University of west Georgia is a great college to attend. They offer more than enough opportunities to help improve your grades you just have to be willing to work for it. The party scene is okay but it is VERY safe because their campus police is always on the scene and also the county police. They have a lot of activities on campus as well , a lot of campus organizations will set up tables on campus to inform you about their organization and they will have different games for you to play to get you interested. I recommend coming here if you are very dedicated to achieving your degree and not just to party."
Niche User,5,When I visited this college the experience was excellent! The students and officials greeted me with smiles and made me feel very welcome. They made me feel as if I were already a student there. The campus was nice and tidy and the rooms were decent sizes. I love it!
Freshman,5,"As a first year college student I was nervous at first but as classes started I soon found out that my professors really care about the growth of their students, and that brought joy to me and makes me feel like I belong here. I have made many friends so far this semester and I have found that they are also really supportive people and that motivate me to want to do great."
Freshman,5,I love the gorgeous campus and all the professors truly do care about your success as a student and there are so man student services offered to make sure you do well.
Sophomore,5,I am heavily involved in Greek Life which has given me a sense of direction and another home. The classes are pretty easy as long as you show up and do your work on time. Most of the professors genuinely want to see you succeed.
Freshman,5,my experience at the university of west Georgia has been an emotional roller coaster considering the fact that i didn't have the funds to attend my dream school. i cried tears and tried everything to attend the school of my dreams. university of west Georgia gave me another chance to attend their school. I'm still struggling with my funds but they allowed me to set up a payment plan so that i can actually stay at this school. allowed me to get an on campus job and set up a payment plan to continue my studies.
Freshman,5,love the campus/ has a family feel with smaller classes. The professors really care about each student.
Freshman,5,"The school offers a large variety of services for students, as long as a well kept campus and an amazing staff! It is relatively affordable for what you get and has amazing programs in nursing, psychology, teaching, etc."
Freshman,5,I like the way they were prepared to help the new timid freshman students on move in day. Very organized plan for the new students and the return students. Extremely informative staff and upbeat student aids. So far my experience has been good and my parents are not as worried.
Freshman,5,"My first week here I learn that they really care about their students. It also fun, you have sometime of activities almost everyday."
Junior,5,I loved how quiet and nice everyone was at school. All I can say is that there is a group for ever single person at UWG because it's such a diverse school!
Sophomore,5,I am a transfer student entering my 2nd year at the school. The transfer process was hard but the school was pretty fast at fixing errors made. The school is easy to learn most class bildings are close together making not being late to class easier. Parking is bad so if you commute I suggest getting to school early to get a spot.
Sophomore,5,At UWG students are so friendly and the environment is a very safe one. The professors are very helpful and understanding.
Sophomore,5,"My experience in college has given me a chance to sharpen my skills in my field of choice. There have been, and there will continue to be, many opportunities to learn more ways of improving my craft. I am truly thankful for my college and all it has to offer. Even the little things matter like the writing center at my school has taught me many writing tips and rules that I was unaware even existed. As well as living in the dorms and growing into the person I want to be. As I continue to attend school i have gained more confidence in my area of studies as well as myself. And as a result, I know one day this valuable experience will help me."
Freshman,5,the university of west GA is a welcoming home town college in the middle of carroll county. The dorm life is great along with great sport teams and other satisfying perks. they are very evetnful and welcoming to first year students
Freshman,5,The University of West Georgia has always been my top pick. It has been my number one pick since I have been in the 8th grade. Before I decided to go there I have already visited the school three times before and loved it. I love their academics and the campus is really pretty. Th campus is also big as well. When apply to West Georgia they did a very good job at keeping in touch with me and making sure if I every needed any help that they were always there. When I went to orientation they did the same thing. They made sure no one was confused on anything and they were very helpful and polite. I would talk to they students that went there and they had nothing but good things to say about the school. Overall they made my experience one that I will never forget.
Freshman,5,I visited the amazing campus its beautiful and slept over night multiple times in high school. For football camps and freshman orientation. Tune after the time was filled with long walks to our destinations but the food made up for it.
Sophomore,5,The things I like about The University of West Georgia are that it is a very welcoming school and they want you to get involved a lot with campus activities and the resources that they have. I've only been to orientation and I already feel like a part of the pack.
Sophomore,5,My time here so far has been great! Love the campus and the professors I have had so far are challenging but good. Diversity is pretty high and that's one of the things I love about this school. Great education and a great place to learn at.
Sophomore,5,I like that West Georgia is very diverse and they different clubs & events to make the minorities feel apart of the community. I also like the professors at West Georgia they will make it their mission to make sure you get all the help you need. West Georgia also has alot of resources to help you with any class you might be having trouble with.
Freshman,5,UWG is a great school to attend if you're all about your school work. There are always great opportunities there for you. Lots free giveaways. Professors actual care about you and your grades they won't let you fail. You always have to be on top of your school work or they won't help you. Other than that it's a safe environment and I love the school. GO WEST GO WOLVES!
Junior,4,What I liked about the university was the show of no lack of amenities and places to eat. The university gym is user-friendly and there are many classes a student can take at the university gym.
Freshman,4,"This is my first week of school and I am enjoying online classes at the University of West Georgia.   I am housed on West Georgia's campus.  I enjoy learning from the comfort of my dorm room wearing my pajamas.  However, I perfer to be physically in the traditional classroom.   I realize I must accept the things I cannot change and do my very best in order to be successful at West Georgia.  This is the new normal due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I enjoy using technology.   My success in online classes requires self-discipline.  My online class allows me to do all the work at my own pace.  As long as I meet the deadlines and participate.  I will be able to email my professor to ask questions directly."
Senior,4,"West Georgia is an amazing school. The dining halls always have different food to serve and never disappoint. The school is division 2, so the campus is easy to get around. Classes don’t reach a crazy amount of students, which is great for people like me who prefer smaller classes with more one on one time with the professor. Overall, West Georgia is a great college to go to and I will never regret spending 2 years at this University."
Senior,4,"All of the online courses I have taken were flexible, and the teachers always took the time to help when you needed it."
Alum,4,Education is very important at the University of West Georgia. Their only downfall is the lack of social events outside of Greek Life
Freshman,4,"I have very much enjoyed being apart of the West Georgia university family! Ever since starting my first semester here to finishing up my first year, the faculty, teachers, and even the students have been very kind and helpful during the very tenuous and stressful transition from high school to college. Even the individuals from different halls such as the Bursar’s Office have been very helpful in being there when I was stressed in figuring out how to succeed in college."
Freshman,4,"UWG hosts a lot of school events, which makes it easy to socialize and build relationships. I think there could be better communication between students and the school but other than that I really enjoy it."
Freshman,4,"During my first year of attending the University, I had a great experience. The students are welcoming and most of the teachers assist with any questions and work with the students. The campus has a lot of resources such as Center of Academic Success, the library, peer tutoring, and office hours provided by teachers for one on one assistance. I would definitely recommend the University of West Georgia to anyone looking for a cheaper college with a great experience."
Freshman,4,"I enrolled in an E-Core course at the University and my experience was pretty good. My professor would take usually more than a day to email me back when I had questions, but the course was very detailed and the information was pretty easy. I would definitely recommend taking an online course for classes such as English or electives."
Senior,4,"The University of West Georgia is a warm and welcoming university with an excellent staff, professors that care and advisors who want you to succeed. I am very happy with the education I have received from the University thus far and hope to continue my education and enter a master's program after finishing my undergraduate degree. I am thankful for the community at the college and the number of opportunities for student involvement and leadership. The facilities are well maintained and the campus is very nice with lots of trees and other landscaping giving it a very picturesque appeal."
Freshman,4,"The University of West Georgia is a wonderful college. UWG has a very beautiful, comfortable campus, as well as a convenient location in Carrollton. It is surrounded by many restaurants and shopping centers for downtime between classes and work. UWG also has a number of excellent professors and staff members. It is also very inclusive to everyone. The only thing I would like to see change about UWG is the atmosphere of a party life. UWG came off to me as a party campus in its design and attitude. If this were to change, UWG would have hit almost every mark in my book."
Freshman,4,I love how accommodating and understanding most professors I had are. They actually care about your grades and wellbeing. From my experience they try to ensure that their classes aren’t unnecessarily hard and if you are confused they will help you out.
Senior,4,"The staff cares deeply about the success of their students. They go out of their way to ensure your success and mentor you towards a bright future. The buildings are not in great condition, but I paid for the education not the scenery."
Freshman,4,it was good. i felt like this college is a good fit for me because it is very interactive and everybody is nice and kind
Alum,4,West Georgia is truly what you make of it. I earned my undergrad degree in 3 1/2  years and was able to still enjoy college life! It is not too far from the city but far enough from home that you have the choice to go back!
Freshman,4,Go West! Is a self-reliant university. It has the best environment. The first day I stepped on the school campus it felt like home.
Sophomore,4,The content for computer science is rigorous and fulfilling. I feel like It does a good job of giving me the information I need to learn for the real world of software engineering and design.
Sophomore,4,UWG was not my first my choice but I have grown to love it so much! Most professors and staff do wanna see you succeed.
Sophomore,4,My experience at West GA has been very good. The community is very helpful and the faculty and staff are really determined to help the students. There are plenty of resources to help students succeed on their college journey and if you need help its highly encouraged to seek it. The only persistent complaint about West Ga is that the food is not really the best but the school is constantly figuring out ways to make the food more enjoyable.
Junior,4,"I love UWG's campus. It really is the perfect size for me; I am able to walk to all my classes, dining halls, and the rec center. The campus is also very beautiful, with lots of greenery and modern architecture. My class sizes are small and feel personal, my professors know my name and care about my education. The students here are very diverse, which creates an open and comfortable community."
Junior,4,"I feel like the faculty here really cares about students and making sure they succeed in their pathways. There is always an event going on, which makes it easy for students to become involved in the school. What I would like to see change is getting more of the local community updated and involved."
Freshman,4,"My experience at the University of West Georgia has been overall great. My professors aren’t too strict, but not too lenient. There are always organizations and on campus activities to participate in to keep yourself active. My friends also play a huge part in my experience because your friends make your college experience better. No matter what college you attend. You have to get involved and stay active at all times to reframe from getting bored or not having “something to do.” Overall my experience is still going great and I look forward to a new semester!"
Senior,4,"My experience has been better with each semester, though I did have a rough start my first semester. I transferred in from another Georgia college and because I do not live on campus, it has been difficult trying to find a new niche of people who share the same interests and passions as me. I am slowly getting there, though. Another thing that is slightly disappointing about this university is the film program and how it compares to my previous university."
Niche User,4,I like how there are two campuses. I attend the Newnan Campus and it was a welcoming and college-like atmosphere.
Alum,4,"I liked the way that the system is layed out because it is designed to help people as much as possible, especially those that might come from a financially challenged position. They want you to succeed and will do what they can to help you achieve your goals."
Sophomore,4,The University of West Georgia is a great school with a wide variety of opportunities to succeed. The campus hosts events regularly to attempt in getting students involved with each other and the surrounding area.
Sophomore,4,"Education wise the school is amazing, the teachers are really involved on and off campus. As far as student events that’s where the dissatisfaction comes in and makes most students leave the school."
Senior,4,"It's a great school academically. All of the professors have been very insightful as well as helpful. I am a business major and the courses that I have taken have all challenged me and have applied to the career path that I would like to go into. Therefore, if you are a business major I would highly recommend applying to the University of West Georgia."
Alum,4,I love how the professors treated us as more than just a source of income but actually devote their time to ensure that we succeed. If I could change something I would try to improve campus life. This college is know as a suitcase school.
Sophomore,4,"I love the nature and the ""homey"" feel about the school. I like that the school is not crowded and overwhelming. The people are great and as well as the professors. One thing I would like to see change at my school is how they don't really announce events as ""loud"" as I would want it to be. With all the people at my school you would think clubs and programs would be at full capacity by now."
Junior,4,The University of West Georgia is an university where students are made sure they are safety. They protect all their students and make sure students accepted for who they are by having a diverse range of student groups. The professors at the University of West Georgia care for the future of their students and actually do care to see their students move on to successful careers.
Sophomore,4,The University of West Georgia is a wonderful place to attend college but it does not live up to what tour guides and others say about the school.
Sophomore,4,My experience as a freshman was very new and exciting. The campus offers several events throughout the week to enjoy. The campus is beautiful.
Freshman,4,I like that there are free tutoring opportunities. I also like that there is a gaming area for people who want to relax. I would change the requirements for housing to give a student a better chance to try and afford to go to college.
Freshman,4,"This is only my first year at UWG and I didn't get a chance to participate in every thing I wanted, but overall the school is amazing. The faculty and staff are very polite and work well with you to make sure your experience in college is great! The teachers vary on teaching styles and difficulty but as long as you talk to them they will help you as much as possible. UWG has a lot of amazing events going around on campus so if you live too far to travel home for the weekend you'll always have something to do. It does not, however, have a lot of places to go off campus because of the location. From campus you're about 30 minutes from the nearest mall and an hour from the city. Also the cafe's food is manageable but you get tired of it really quick. Overall my first year experience at West Georgia was amazing."
Junior,4,"I'm entering my third year at UWG and I can honestly say that the atmosphere of the campus made my transition from high school to university so much easier. There's always some kind of social event going on, and there are plenty of opportunities to get involved and meet new people."
Niche User,4,"I have not actually got to attend yet, but during the admissions process everyone I have interacted with whether it be via phone or e-mail has been incredibly helpful."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed the personal experience i encountered while attending the Newnan campus. The professor truly takes out the time to learn your weak points. Then at least once a week a campus gathering happens such as a BBQ, Picnic, or even just a career event. They provide all the resources needed to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"West Georgia is a small school, which if you're interested in a small school, I think its okay. Do not go here if you want something to do in the town because there is nothing. Carrollton and even UWG need more activities added."
Sophomore,4,"The University of West Georgia has a landscape of opportunities available for students to grow and succeed. UWG offers tutoring, counseling, and academic coaching that all aid in the academic success of students. Dining Halls, dorms, and classrooms each cultivate a safe and creative learning environment. There is a plethora of ways to get involved at West Georgia including Greek life, campus ministries, and intramural sports. The majority of professors and advisers wish to see students succeed and are a helping hand in the process of completing courses. I would highly recommend the University of West Georgia to anyone desiring a vibrant and fruitful college experience."
Freshman,4,"The school is pretty nice in general. I haven't had any major issues with anything, but of course, like everything, it is not perfect. The staff of most departments are kind and helpful, and if you need any questions answered, they are always available and respond quickly. The food is okay, it's a lot of the same. There could be more variety, but it is overall not bad. The campus is beautiful and well kept. In the middle of the semester, the campus doesn't really have a lot of events going on unless there's a special event coming up. More of the action occurs in the beginning and at the end of the school year. Overall, the University of West Georgia is a nice school and I would give it a B+ in total quality. I will be attending next semester."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at the University of West Georgia has been a great learning experience, coming from another institution to being at this university has showed me the in's and out's of being a professional student and becoming a fine tuned man at the end of the day. From the student life and the professor's helping me with my progression on my journey to achieving my goals of gaining my bachelors degree in Sports Management, I'm almost complete with this and I have to give the credit to the people that helped me get here and giving me life lessons that I'll never forget, and those people are the professors that spent the extra time on helping me get the information they're trying to pass on. Also the friendships and connections I have made during my time period here so for because of the contributions that they gave me to becoming a better being that can help me in the long term because the experience I have gained from these experiences have changed me forever."
Sophomore,4,"Coming to Carrollton from Brooklyn was a big change for me. Not only location wise, but also social wise. Being here for my first year taught me a lot about myself. Along with learn about myself, I did receive the full “first year college experience”, as cliche as that sounds. Education wise, I learned things I have to work on for my semesters to follow, such as my procrastination and speaking to my professors."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the environment because it is pretty laid back however,  I have not had the best experiences with advisors and some of the teachers."
Sophomore,4,"Though I don't really have any people to make the experience enjoyable, I think UWG is a nice school with very kind and caring professors as well as an increasingly diverse student body."
Junior,4,It's a pretty good school. Tuition isn't too bad and there are a lot of scholarships for both general expenses and for things like studying abroad.
Freshman,4,My experience overall has been amazing for my first year and im excited for the next 3 years! The people are inviting the campus feels like home and the teachers are great and everyone is always extremely helpful.
Freshman,4,The University of West Georgia is a very diverse and welcoming school. It has clubs for all kinds of students to get involved in and they’re always trying to get students involved by throwing activities on campus for students to attend and have fun.
Freshman,4,I like how UWG has many clubs and organizations that cater to a variety of interests. I also like how there’s always something going on on the campus so you don’t have to be stuck in your room all day.
Junior,4,Very great school! I live off campus without a car and rely on the shopper shuttle to go to the grocery store. It would be nice if they had morning routes because it conflicts with my class schedule when it’s in the afternoon.
Freshman,4,"West Georgia is a very diverse community with a lot of people from different parts of the world. West Georgia is a friendly community too with a lot of welcoming faculty and students too. When I came for my orientation, everyone was so nice and we had a lot of interesting activities that we did and I thought they did all that to get us to come to the school. When I came to the school and started my first semester, they kept having the same type of welcoming community with a lot of different activities to get involved and a lot of different free prizes. Up to now West Georgia is a friendly environment and it helps a lot with the transferring from different environments."
Junior,4,"I've had a really good experience at this university, one it being in the state of my dreams and two how involved the university makes its students."
Freshman,4,It is a great university with professors who really care about you. The class sizes are small so it is great for individual attention and provides a good learning environment for the student. The opportunities are also there for students to get involved which made it easy to make friends and make the most of my experience at UWG.
Alum,4,I wish I was still in college at UWG. I had a great time while I was in school. I used to be so ready to graduate but now I wish i was still in school. I have so many memories in Carrollton.
Freshman,4,Involvement is great and staff from any department is always available for you. Also many resources to get grades up and stay on track.
Sophomore,4,My overall experience with the University of West Georgia has changed my life drastically. I have been challenged in so many ways mentally and physically for the greater good of myself. Going to West Georgia has taught me how to love myself and adapt to others. While learning more about myself I also learned more about others. If I ever feel lost I know that West Georgia is there for me. I know that I have found some of my forever friends here and have made connections with the staff at this school that I know will help me in the future. West Georgia has never left me feeling out of place or secluded from anything. West Georgia really means it when they say united we howl.
Sophomore,4,I choose the university of West Georgia because the campus was close to home and relatively cheap in regards to other campuses in the area.
Junior,4,"If you want to be pushed out of your comfort zone, get a degree, and leave with life long memories, there is no other university to attend. UWG has given me the best undergraduate experience I could hope for."
Sophomore,4,"Great, I am currently about to be in my second year and am studying for my social science degree. I plan on attending school while working after I graduate and earning a masters degree."
Sophomore,4,My experience at West Georgia has been very positive for the most part. The food is good most of the time though it can be lacking at times. The parties and campus are usually pretty good as well.
Alum,2,"While the College of Science and Mathematics is very good, bolstered by an excellent Geology department, the essentially open enrollment policy of the university recruits too many low quality students. This strategy delegitimizes a degree from the university because of decreased rigor in the classroom.
On the other hand, a talented and motivated student can achieve here inexpensively."
Graduate Student,2,"Completely incompetent admissions department. Impossible to get a straight answer from any department. Not transparent about program tuition- I received  a quote of $7,000 from one financial aid agent, ""we can't tell you"" from another, and $15,000 from my adviser. I was connected to someone higher up in the financial aid office and left a message but never received a call back. 

I do really enjoy one of my classes- Dr. Morris is outstanding. However, the other one has no idea what she is doing and is making the experience unbearable."
Sophomore,2,"my first year experience to say the least was intersecting.  overall education wise was great, however everything else needs improvement. the way they make freshmen choose roommates based on questions need to change. i moved three times due to roommates issues. wifi sucks. the food was decent i guess but expensive.   our sport teams were good.   university of west georgia had a huge diversity of students. party scene is great. i was involved in sac student activity council that put on huge events for the school"
Sophomore,2,"It is not a fun school and it is even worse if you are a female I had two horrible roommate situations, the school barely helped me and still think I’m the cause when I told them sereval times and gave them evidence that these girls were just petty. I can not wait to leave this university, most of my friends have already left because of the unhappiness with this university. This is my last semester."
College Sophomore,2,There are certain fraternities and sororities that do not have houses. It seems as if it is mostly the black sororities and fraternities that do not.
College Sophomore,2,"No on really talks about clubs and sports. It's apart of campus life, but I don't really hear anyone having conversations about it."
College Freshman,2,The school do not really shed light on the career you would want to pursue in by having the right programs and organizations you can join.
College Freshman,2,My experience was not good because the RA was too into drama
College Freshman,2,"There have been many shootings, fights, and even some cases of sexual assault since I started college at the University of West Georgia in Fall 2015."
College Freshman,2,"I did not live on campus for my first semester (Fall 2015), but my friends have told me about the inefficiency of campus police and individuals in charge of ensuring contentedness and safety of students living on campus."
College Junior,2,"I always have to make sure that I'm walking in the group because of how open our campus is, it's extremely dangerous."
College Freshman,2,I love the school but just failed a class and I'm not sure what to do anymore.
College Freshman,2,Great school but I feel as though it is not as diverse as I would like and student involvement is low.
College Junior,2,"The police do nothing but send out emails, and still don't find the person who committed the crime. You might as well carry a gun and knife and mace spray and protect yourself."
College Freshman,2,It has a negative impact on students at this school and most of them do not realize it. I hear about a lot of students and even know a few who are too focused on the drinking and partying to make decent grades.
College Freshman,2,I have gotten sick from the food a few times and have heard of other students with the same problem.
College Freshman,2,I struggled the past summer and am struggling currently with finding any financial aid.
College Freshman,2,"The people in the front desk do not know what they are talking about most of the time, you leave the office more confused than when you originally came. Counselors rarely ever see people unless someone puts up a fit about seeing them or sets an appointment to see them."
College Junior,2,I do not receive the financial aid I need.
College Junior,2,"Housing and Residence life has awful administration. It is nearly impossible to get in touch with them. If you have a bad roommate, they refuse to switch you to another room. If you have financial difficulties, they refuse to work with you. Housing and Residence life does not care about the students at all or what their living conditions are like. Some of the dorm buildings are falling apart and need either repairs or upgrades. They have not fixed them. They force you to live on campus whether you want to or not."
College Senior,2,Parties on college campuses are a way to connect and get to know your peers on a differnt level. Parties are looked at as an oulet for most college students and gives them time away from all the stressful bookwork that can beome overwhelming. Here on my campus it is very little parting because everything always gets shut down early and the police always label all parties as bad when sometimes the students just want to celebrate aceing an exam. the Party scene needs improvement
College Sophomore,2,I live 15 minutes away and have to leave 40 minutes early to be on time
College Junior,2,"The parking here is absolutely terrible. They keep building more buildings, which takes away parking. They have a small lot for Arbor View. Might hold 100 cars. Maybe. But there's 3 buildings... And many Tyus students park there too. I know that's not the only lot with issues, but that's where I mainly am."
College Sophomore,2,"I feel that the police do a very good job of watching out for students, but they can't be everywhere on campus unfortunately. For years, students have always heard of sexual assaults that occur on campus, but the administration covers it up because of who the involved parties are. I don't feel comfortable if I ever have to be on campus when it's deserted or when it starts to get dark."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is taken very seriously by the students in the Greek system. Most of the other students don't really like the Greek students because they tend to be very snobby to those outside of sororities and  fraternities.
College Junior,2,"Just having to walk alone is enough to make most females stay at home. Between the new unlit trails being built by the community and the very recent and numerous robberies and assaults happening on and off campus, most people will not go out alone to take a chance. In the apartments there are police every weekend due to drugs and shootings, even in the gated communities, which is concerning. With the campus police staying in their vehicles at all times and no other authority around.. anything could happen and that is terrifying when all I want to do is go to class."
College Junior,2,"The number of fast food choices alone reaches 12 that I can think of right now. It is an endless supply of unhealthy habits being created just because going to eat anywhere else is 30 or more minutes away. With the cheap food around every corner in a very small community around the University of West Georgia, it isn't difficult to understand how these companies stay in business. They advertise to college students with low prices and convenience but lack nutrition facts. Go figure."
College Junior,2,I do not attend the parties but my friends that live on campus complain about the noise from the parties in the dorms.
College Junior,2,I don't see the point in joining Greek Life. They don't do a lot around campus and really only party. The housing is not very good and is away from campus.
College Freshman,2,Our crime is at an all time high
College Junior,2,"I feel nervous being on campus, because of all the recent attacks."
College Senior,2,Campus housing is rude and not understanding
College Senior,2,The guys are pretty bad. I will not be finding my husband in Carrollton.
College Freshman,2,I grew up here so it was the cheapest option for me
College Freshman,2,"The dining halls on campus are pretty bad. The food does not always taste good and is not always fresh. The utensils and plates are rarely clean without stains. The positive food choices on campus are at the UCC, containing Chick-fil-a and Subway."
College Freshman,2,I feel very unsafe walking alone on campus at night. There are multiple theft/criminal activities that occur on campus. There are many areas on campus that are unlit and have no access to emergency services.
College Senior,2,"Overall, this schools teachers are terrible. There are very few who actually should be teaching. Most of them are just doing their job for the paycheck, and doing it poorly I might add."
College Senior,2,"To say the least, pot/weed was way too common. Residential assistants often came knocking on doors to investigate who was smoking pots or was creating ""pot brownies""."
College Senior,2,"Diversity is very thin. Many African-American students. Very few international students, and overall acceptance of others views, beliefs, and political standing is very insignificant."
College Senior,2,"Carrollton is really not a safe city, so safety will always be an issue. Parking is not the best, either."
College Freshman,2,"Not enough lots, They ticket a lot."
College Junior,2,Still stuck in the 80's. The biology department needs a serious makeover and has hardly the equipment needed to get through labs. If compared to other schools it would not be in the top 10.
College Freshman,2,There is absolutely nothing to do off-campus. There is a lot of places to eat but that's about it. The closest mall is about 30 minutes away.
College Sophomore,2,Not much to do around campus
College Freshman,2,I haven't gone through the actual application process yet but there are a lot of pre-requisites.
College Freshman,2,There hasn't really been anything done to lower the amount of students that do drugs and alcohol. Almost everyone does it.
College Student,2,"I feel that for the campus to be as small as it is, the time you wait for the bus is way to long."
College Junior,2,It is very rare that they are available. The wireless network almost never works properly.
College Student,2,"I have been told that out of the 95 students in the program I am trying to enter.. only 4 were offered an interview. Know what you want to do before you get to college. Also make sure that you have someone who is there to help you figure out class situations, financial aid and everything else you may need assistance with It is NOT easy doing it alone."
College Student,2,It takes there to be such thick sheets of ice for school to cancel but by then students are already stuck near campus. Sometimes with no where to go.
College Student,2,I can't have a normal conversation without someone asking me if I smoke.. No I don't I wish people would stop thinking that is an acceptable question to ask someone you have just met.
College Student,2,There is crime reported on or near campus all the time.
College Student,2,When I stayed on campus I got the worst and one of the oldest building on campus. It was an all girl dorm and it smelled awful. They have since closed down this dorm and new ones are being built.
College Sophomore,2,Wifi on campus sucks it is always down and most of the time you can't get in in your dorm. Routers work wonders here even though you are not supposed to have them. Having a laptop is not that necessary since the library is conveniently located and there is always a computer available there.
College Sophomore,2,The academics here at UWG aren't so good and that's why most people are here. It is east to get admitted.
College Sophomore,2,"Although accessing everything on campus is close, the parking is not great. People typically walk everywhere because once you leave a spot, it disappears within 10 sec."
College Sophomore,2,"The area of West Georgia is in Carollton. The city has a few nice dining places that are college budget friendly but other than that, it is in the middle of no-wheres-ville. "
College Junior,2,Hard to get to. Its only aimed at the incoming freshmen living on campus.
College Junior,2,"My roommate had a male friend over one night working on a project. She left the door open when she walked to the bathroom and an RA walked by and wrote me up for having an ""after-hours guest"""
College Junior,2,"They always seem to be around for parking tickets, yet are no where to be found when someone is being robbed on campus."
Senior,1,"Do not go here and if you have to commute because this school has a terrible campus life. There is no diversity! Also, people are so mean here! I have come across just really unfriendly people in class and on campus. They claim they have no funds so they have cut a lot of things like bus services, food, and what events we can do. The events they have on-campus are cheaply done. The dining halls food is not bad but there is no variety because they cook the same stuff all the time which is high in fat. The Wifi goes down all the time. I will walk around campus with no service which is a huge safety concern!!! The dorms are old so there is that! Also if something happens on campus as far as safety issues we never hear about it. I hear things from my friends and not the university itself. Then there are some fast drivers here who do not stop for pedestrians and west Georgia prides itself with being a walking campus"
Junior,1,"If you are looking to go to this school then please go somewhere else. West Georgia was not my first choice at all and I only came here becasue they accept everybody. Which may be good yes but they only do it so they can get more money. Campus is small and they do not plan a lot of activities and if they do it's done very poorly. There are only two dining halls on campus and one of them closes on the weekend. I had to walk all the way across campus to eat on the weekends plus I've gotten food poisioning from EC twice. They only pay attention to biology, education, nursing, business, and criminolgy majors. Professors are good if in a small class. They only clean the freshmen dorms while there are upperclassmen are living in mold infested dorms like me. I told housing about it two months ago and nothing.  There is not much diversity as it's mostly black and white. Carrollten is not a good town. Honestly if you are not an athlete or in greek life you will be very bored."
Freshman,1,West Georgia is horrible. Ready to transfer. The professors really need to understand that every college student cannot afford all these textbooks that we are not going to use in the classroom. The student life here sucks nobody shows school pride and the cops come to shut down every party within ten minutes. The girls here are very rude and the boys here are so disgusting it makes zero sense. Overall this school sucks but I'm  just one opinion out of many.
College Freshman,1,tranferring to a better school.
College Freshman,1,No one talks to each other you will be bored out your mind.
College Freshman,1,Boring Boring Boring. join a frat if you want friends.
College Sophomore,1,"Financial aid is terrible, office people are a headache and a nightmare to work with, drop/add dates suck, teachers are generally good."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't go to the main campus, and their is nothing at the one I go to."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial department sucks. I wanted to drop a class after it started and found out it wasn't for me, but the drop date was a few days before class started. Completly unorganized and unhelpful. Most of the teachers are great, but thats about it. 10/10 would not recommend."
College Junior,1,They are racist and dont want nobody they dont know to talk to them.
College Freshman,1,"I honestly never go anywhere by myself on campus because of how unsafe I feel, which makes me feel trapped inside of my room."
College Freshman,1,"No one really cares like they should. I feel that if school spirit were higher then maybe the school itself would be better, friendlier, and have more involved students."
College Freshman,1,"Is not racially diverse, teachers don't seem to care whether the students pass or fail, we have tons of issues regarding safety: shootings, stabbing, domesticated violence, etc. 

I am a white female who seems to stand out among the other races and feels almost looked down upon because of so. I would not choose this school if I could go back. I'm thousands of dollars worth of debt and I'm only 18."
College Junior,1,"Food is disgusting, always gave me stomach aches"
College Freshman,1,As a non-greek I cannot really dwell on how greek housing is
College Sophomore,1,Parties disturb study time and sleep in the dorms. Experiencing this first hand was awful.
College Sophomore,1,Greeks seem very snobby and do not associate with non-Greeks. Our sororities have been recently banned from on-and-off campus parties because of alcohol. Greek life is not something I see as very positive on our campus.
College Sophomore,1,"It's very hard to get financial aid. I transferred from a different university after my freshman year, and trying to get my transcripts in order to receive financial aid was a nightmare on UWG's part."
College Junior,1,"Broken bed frames, busted lights, maintenance that does not respond, and uneven floors were my Freshmen year dorm experience. The ease of getting to classes and on-campus events made the living situation seem worth it though. My friends and I were hardly ever in our rooms unless it was to sleep or watch weekly our tv shows."
College Junior,1,Girls on campus are not friendly what so ever
College Freshman,1,Parking for commuter students is horrible. There are never any parking spots unless you are extremely early or unless you want to walk 10 minutes to get to the campus. They also continue to take community parking spots away to give to the on campus parkers.
College Senior,1,"I would definitely choose a different school if possible. In fact, transferring is in my near future. This school has been the absolute worst decision of my life. Everyday I regret the choice I made to attend that school."
College Senior,1,If the problem is not the space it is the roommate. Social atmosphere is a joke. Cost is ridiculous for the quality of the dorm rooms.
College Senior,1,"It is absolutely horrible. I usually had to have my husband drop me off because I could never find a parking spot close enough to walk from. And the designated parking is terrible. I received two tickets that were absolutely bogus. If they are not going to designate a parking area, then they should not punish students when they park where they can see an empty spot. Ridiculous."
College Senior,1,"People there are rude. They are very self centered. The students are obnoxious, idiotic, and very inconsiderate."
College Junior,1,"Not many scholarships available, and the push grants/ loans on students instead."
College Freshman,1,The wifi at UWG is absolutely horrible. An Ethernet cord is a necessity!
College Freshman,1,There aren't a lot of things to do if you don't have a car.
College Student,1,I have only lived in two off campus housing situations and both have been terrible. In order to study at my current apartment I have to travel to my families house in another city. It is very inconvenient. Always having parties and really loud and noisy. The offices have been no help at all. I like the space I am in and my roommate situation turned out better this time but the people who live around me are awful because the walls are so thin and the place I live at is too cheap to get thicker walls. It has just been an awful experience with living away from home.
College Freshman,1,"Residential freshmen are required to park a mile off campus and wait for 30 minutes to an hour for a bus to come and pick us up to ride to campus. However, students who are not freshmen do have great parking. "
College Senior,1,"Federal aid is best bet, hard to get school loans"
College Freshman,1,"I have been late to work because of the shuttle on more than one occasion, and I have to wait at least 30 minutes on it every time because there is only one that goes to the Freshman parking lot."
College Freshman,1,"I have been unable to get any jobs or internships through the school, and my marketing advisor actually discouraged my internship that I have with Disney. "
College Freshman,1,I have to park over a mile away from my dorm and classes because all Freshman are required to park at the football stadium even though there is plenty of parking on campus. 
College Freshman,1,I have not been able to talk to anyone about off campus housing at all.
College Freshman,1,"I am the most anti-Greek Life person ever. I think that almost all Greek life people are annoying and stuck up, so I am not the person to ask about it."
College Sophomore,1,"People are always racing for spots. The parking lots with the most open spaces are usually the ones farthest away from all of the buildings. Things have gotten a little better though. They're making freshmen park over at the stadium, leaving more room for commuters and upperclassmen. Since the freshmen are required to live on campus, for the most part, I think this is a somewhat fair rule. The only lacking aspect of it is that I think it includes those who don't have 30 credit hours and aren't second year students. I have a friend who is a second year, that I always see waiting for the parking shuttle."
College Senior,1,The financial aid department is a joke. They refused to pick up the phone over the summer. This led to an EXTREME delay in providing me with the funds I needed. I had to ask repeatedly what was wrong with my account for them to finally give me an answer that wasn't defaulted for every student with a problem. The department is full of false promises and has ultimately led to my being forced to sit out of school a semester. Their practices are very unacceptable.
College Senior,1,You never really notice the campus security being around even after robbery at gun point and a sexual assault committed on campus.
College Sophomore,1,The bus schedule was pretty bad this was one thing that I really disliked about west georgia. The buses only run until 11 on weekdays. Also on fridays they stop running around 6 and weekends they dont run at all. Other than the hours transportation was pretty good.
College Junior,1,"I absolutely hated living on campus. The buildings weren't clean, the fellow students aren't tidy at all, and the resident assistants are too strict sometimes. The worst part of it all is the bathroom. The housekeeping doesn't clean as thoroughly as they should."
College Junior,1,"Parking availability is pretty horrendous. I feel this way despite the fact that I don't own a car. In the last couple of years the school has put out this massive marketing campaign to bring in students, but failed to increase the amount of parking space. Its really bad."
College Sophomore,1,"I am currently a Pre- Mass Commuincations major and I am really unhappy with the way I am treated. I am almost a junior, but I am still treated as a Freshman by being sent to the Excel Center to be advised. My typical advisement takes about all of five minutes, and my advisor does not pay attention to my course history and suggets that I take 3000 level courses when I have not taken the 2000 level prerequisite."
College Freshman,1,There are never enough parking spots for students. Especially for those who stay on campus. We'll end up having to park far from our dorms and walk.
College Freshman,1,The parking is not very good at all. It is so hard to find a good parking spot where you won't have to walk so far. They are really strict about parking too. If you park in a spot that is not allowed with your parking permit you mosly likely will have a parking ticket when you get back.
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are a lot of commuters that park in a small and very limited amount of space. The university is in dire need of parking decks and more space for everyone to park. If you do have to drive to school, make sure you get to the area at least 30 minutes early and if you're lucky, you might find a parking spot."
College Freshman,1,This school is isolated so having a car or knowing someone you can ride with is very practical.
College Sophomore,1,The force is horrible about everything fun people try to do.
College Freshman,1,It gets really hot then really cold. Carrollton has really crazy weather.
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have morning classes, it is almost impossible to get a good spot if you can find one at all."
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, the food sucks at the Z6 and I am not a picky eater either. You get the same food every day and it never really changes. Meal tickets are a waste of money. Food court though, as great food but at high prices so your screwed either way. "
College Sophomore,1,"There known for being stingy with money, but they'll gladly take yours."
College Freshman,1,"There is not enough parking accessibility. There are two different housing building sharing a parking lot because of construction, but there are typically not enough places for commuters to park."
College Freshman,1,"It cost more to live on campus than it actually does for tuition, and the prices are only rising. There are more options for on campus living for freshman than for any other class. The freshman dorms are located closer to the academic buildings than housing for upperclassmen. Basically the University of West Georgia caters to their freshman."
College Freshman,1,NO WHERE TO GO! Around my school there is only a McDonald's to walk to and the goodplaces are in driving distance.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus Quad in Carrollton, GA – When I talked to my roommates about it and asked them their opinion they  told me that they go there to party. If you want to waste you and your parent's money then go right ahead, but if you are looking to get a good education avoid the University of West Georgia and avoid Campus Quad.

Their cost is $390 per month with an electricity cap of $25 per person.

Their availability is not the best, but I guess it is full of party people so they should be out of there in a couple of years.

Convenience is that they are close to campus to walk if you need to, but the school does have a bus shuttle that runs to them also.

Maintenance, parking, and safety are very bad here. The maintenance has been known to steal your stuff if you are not there to watch it when they come to ""fix"" a problem you have. Parking is very bad. People will ride your bumper and zoom in after you do if they do not live there to have a parking place. This has been said to be a ""Ghetto"", and it is not an exaggeration."
College Junior,1,"While statistics may show otherwise I feel as though our campus is racially seperated. Carrollton Campus seems to be mostly black people, while Newnan campus is mostly white. In addition, I have noticed many persons lately avioding the Carrollton campus solely based on the fact that there are several people ""hanging out"" on campus that do not actually go to school there."
College Freshman,1,"Food is not available past 8 p.m. The ""Wolves Den"" is never open on the weekend and the Z closes earlier on the weekends. There is not a variety of foods offered and not enough good fruit and healthier options. Options only include pizza, burgers, fries, and past pretty much. I  am not satisfied."
College Junior,1,"The fan base for UWG is dry. Not a lot of students support UWG teams. There is no tradition at the games for UWG. The most people that we have at the games are players parents. We have no school spirit what so ever at UWG. That is why students transfer to UGA because of the lacking of team performance, fan support, and school spirit."
College Freshman,1,"Parking at West Georgia is ALWAYS a hassle. I have to fight for a space in close proximity to my dorm even, and if you are a commuter, forget about even being able to park near anything. Sometimes it's hard to find a spot at all, and extremely easy to get a parking ticket."

Alum,5,I never took an online class when I attended HU but this system wants me to write 100 words about it.
Sophomore,5,Amazing school. Very active and helpful staff and friendly student body. Conviently located and lovely campus. Professors are dedicated to their students and passionate about they craft.
Sophomore,5,Professor work hard to ensure that every student is learning just as much online as they would in the classroom.
Freshman,5,I have experienced so much at Huntington. The community is great and the staff is so good. The athletics is good.
Sophomore,5,"I loved the campus and having everything right there. The walks are short from the dorms to classes, every one gets along great and always has a smile on their face. The teacher love talking with their students and love it when students ask for help. There are lots of things that happen on campus to keep us students busy just by having fun and hangout by campfires."
Freshman,5,Great experience during my visit to campus.  Students all seem to know each other very well.  I definitely felt at home here.
Junior,5,The reason that I think so highly of this school is that they look me in with open arms. I transferred to them from a college that made me feel not wanted. When I arrived I started to love the career choice that I had made for myself at the other school. I realized that it was not me and it was just that I was not at the right school. They treat the students like family in the department that I am in. the nursing professors have their doors open 24/7. They are not just working for a paycheck they are working because they love what they do and care greatly about us.
Freshman,5,"It has a great Christian atmosphere and you get to know everyone really well. It also has really great tutoring programs, and you can work one on one with most of your professors to get any help you may need about your coursework."
Junior,5,"Very pretty campus, great faculty, good dorm life, a lot of teams compete at a high level in the NAIA, and best of all there are no parties."
Freshman,5,"Best school I could ever ask for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Junior,5,"I go to the Arizona campus (Huntington University Center for Digital Media Arts) in Peoria, AZ. It is a great commuter campus with the best education in film, broadcast, graphic design, and animation in the state."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely loved my first year at Huntington University. I felt like my professors actually cared about my personal education.
Freshman,5,"Even though i am a student for their satellite location in Arizona, Huntington University is a great place for someone to learn and pursue their dream careers. I am in their Film Production major and I have been having a lot of fun working on the assigned projects. There's little lectures about the subjects and after those, the teachers will assign you a team and job and you'll be on your way. In the end, Huntington University is an amazing school for those who are willing to chase after their dreams."
Freshman,5,Huntington University has an amazing Christian environment in which someone can feel safe and comfortable while preparing for his or her career. It's a blessing to find such kind of University.
Graduate Student,5,"I have yet to attend Huntington University, however my experience with the faculty has been very positive. The academic advisers are quick in their email replies. The faculty is very welcoming."
Sophomore,5,"I chose Huntington because of the Film and Broadcasting program. Instead of having to wait till my junior or senior year to touch any of the equipment, I was able to learn and use the equipment within the first weeks of school. The day I walked into FDN News (Forester Digital Network) I was asked to do a live shot for our very own news program. It is my second year working with FDN and I am currently the anchor for the station. Through film, I have made countless connections in order to pursue my dream of being a music video director and editor. I have directed and edited my own short film that I was able to enter into a 4-H National Film Festival and placed first in the narrative category. Only two years into school, I have exceeded my own expectations and am continuing to grow every day. I highly suggest Huntington to anyone."
Freshman,5,"It is a wonderful campus filled with a lot of caring people. My experience with the professors is they are all really helpful, nice, and supportive. Most of the students are also really welcoming and nice."
Freshman,5,"I love the community of the school. It feels like home to me. Everyone there is really nice and the upperclassmen don't act superior or ""high and mighty"" towards the underclassmen. Even all of the professors are great, and willing to help you in any way they can."
Sophomore,5,Amazing experience so far and I have grown so much  in one semester.  I want to continue to learn and grow.
Freshman,5,"Huntington University is a top-notch school! The focus on faith is undeniable. The teachers are fantastic and genuinely care about their students. I have learned so much in my short time here already! There are many opportunities for spiritual, social, and academic growth."
Niche User,5,Huntington University campus is beautiful! The staff is very nice. I am involved with my high school campus life and the Huntington University volunteers that run the program represent HU perfectly!
Freshman,5,"Huntington University has definitely changed how I view many different subjects. Including My Major which is Film Production. The professor and student relationship is unlike anything I have seen. You can actually feel as though that they know you, also all of them actually enjoy teaching the subject they are teaching! All of the students quickly become part of your family. If any one person has an issue everyone around is concerned for that individual and will help any way they can. I have personally experienced this during a crisis in my life. This college definitely impacted my life in the best possible way. 10 out of 10 would rate again."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Huntington University! The professors are wonderful and really care  about how well you do in their classes. The staff and faculty are wonderful and make everyone feel welcomed. The campus is beautiful and all the students are so nice. I am so happy God has blessed me with an amazing school like Huntington University.
Junior,5,I transferred into Huntington University and I have not been disappointed. The professors are extremely helpful and they want you to succeed. I also really enjoy the sporting events and atmosphere of the college.
College Freshman,5,Our parties consists of root beer nothing illegal or alcoholic(:
College Freshman,5,"I think it's hard at times but this is college. It's not meant to be easy. It's a perfect amount for people to handle, even if you don't do great time management"
College Freshman,5,We are one of the safest campuses around. I think that's enough said
College Freshman,5,I haven't worked with this much but I have been told it good
College Freshman,5,Very small class rooms so teachers learn names very quickly and personalities. It's wonderful to get to know you prof.
College Freshman,5,Everything is pretty great. Other than my stinky roommate.
College Freshman,5,Everyone has school spirit. Many people go to games. Most of the people there pay some kind of sport. Everyone is supportive
College Freshman,5,"Very small, but not crammed. Everyone is friendly. Everyone knows everyone"
College Sophomore,5,No major crimes have happened on campus that i am aware of. We had a problem with a person breaking in the cars once. My cooking pot was stolen but one person. Their is always some one to report to. Campus police and are easy to get a hold of if you feel unsafe.
College Sophomore,5,the rules being enforced really depends on the RAs that are in charge. But over my time in the dorms has been wonderful.
College Freshman,5,The academics at Huntington are extremely good and worthwhile.
College Freshman,5,The diversity on campus is very good and extremely accepted.
College Freshman,5,There's is little to no drug use/selling on or off campus.
College Freshman,5,I feel extremely safe and secure everywhere on campus.
College Freshman,5,"The value of a degree from Huntington University is very good and I could see getting a very worth while career with it, in the future."
College Freshman,5,The professors are extremely smart and helpful. The courses are challenging but you learn a lot.
College Freshman,5,The community is extremely inviting and the second you arrive you already feel like you're part of the family.
College Freshman,5,"No alcohol, drugs allowed on campus. Period."
College Freshman,5,I feel completely safe on campus. Campus police are always around and HU has been awarded the safest campus in the mid-west so I have no worries when I am out at night.
College Junior,5,"The floor I live on is awesome. I really appreciate and love the community. The other dorms I visit to go and be with other friends, I have noticed there is community and fun in every hall. I love it so much and it is like having a small family. We celebrate holidays together, go camping/hiking, we watch movies and all around just enjoy in being in each others company."
College Junior,5,I transfer to my school. My first three years of college were okay. But ever since I transfer over to Huntington I have never enjoyed college more. There is such a sense of community and there is always something fun to do. The teachers really care about us as students and that is something I never had at my old college. Since I am from out of state the campus became a home away from home and I wouldn't change it. This school is placing me in leadership positions I never knew I would do. Plus I am traveling and getting on hands experience and this really helps me with my field of study. I wouldn't change my schooling at all and I honestly wish I would have done my first three years here.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Excellent Professors! I had great opportunities to know my professors personally, creating space for honest conversations between students and faculty."
College Junior,5,"It is awesome to live on campus. From what I have seen, people on the floors develop great communities. We also have a disc golf course (9 holes) which is a lot of fun. Our PLEX or recreation building is really nice. It's not perfect but there is still a lot there. All of the deans or Resident Directors make sure that it is easy for you to get a room where you want which is awesome."
College Freshman,5,I've seen the off campus housing but I haven't stayed in them. They seem awesome though.
College Freshman,5,I love my residence hall!!
College Freshman,5,I love eating on or off campus. Both foods are good
College Freshman,5,I love it. College all together is tough but I'm determined to hang on. I am double majoring in Missions and Business with a minor in TESOL. I enjoy my classes and everyone I have met. My professors really get to know there students and they want us to succeed and not fail. They will work with us no matter what. My ministry classes are my favorite.
College Freshman,5,Helping others gain greater satisfaction with their lives tops all other human professions! I aim to be a specialist within the field of Occupational Therapy and make a difference in our world. I do not have concerns of employment after graduating.
College Sophomore,5,"I have zero problems with parking.  In fact, the way they set it up is great because there are spots in parking lots across from or next to the buildings where I take my classes that I am allowed to park in."
College Sophomore,5,"I've only really explored a few buildings but all the staff is very helpful.  Once, I found someone's debit card on the ground and left it with an attendant.  I knew it would be safe and they would find the owner."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel like if any student is obviously disrespectful or disruptive, the matter is addressed appropriately and immediately."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is so friendly and welcoming
College Sophomore,5,I love it here- I wouldn't go anywhere else
College Sophomore,5,They were beyond helpful in getting me set up.
College Sophomore,5,Students can smoke in designated area. Very few students do. No alcohol.
College Sophomore,5,Great faculty. Great opportunities to get involved and have hands on experiences.
Freshman,4,The online experience was hard to get use but wants you got use to it then it was easy. I think the online experience was fun.
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Huntington University so far. I love my professors and the relationships I have built with them. I am able to work hard in academics and be involved in many campus activities and groups. This university provides a safe environment where you can explore who you are in academics and what you believe in religion. I have grown as a student, athlete, and Christian during my time at HU."
Junior,4,I love the community here at Huntington. Everybody (staff and students) are so friendly and helpful. I would love to see construction on the HUB to be started and new dining options though.
Sophomore,4,"The people here are amazing! Everyone is super friendly and accepting. The professors care about your life, and they want to see you succeed academically. The school is set on a beautiful campus full of trees with a small lake at the epicenter. During the fall when the leaves change color the campus is just so nice to walk through. I highly recommend this place!"
Junior,4,"HU has created a space where students can learn and grow in their faith, their chosen profession and as a person. The professiors are their with the students every step of the way."
Alum,4,"The education at Huntington University is truly spectacular. Although more expensive due to it being a private university, the cost was more that worth the level of education I received here. It is hard to find a department here that does not have at least one if not many beloved and invested professors that help change students lives for the better. My greatest issue with the institution is that it does not seem like the students are heard by the administration when they express their  wants and needs. This means that the community heavily suffers and many students leave because of rules and regulations that are only supported by a small group of officials whom these rules to not affect. College is more than academics and in the case of Huntington, religious vision. Huntington lacks the freedom to be a little crazy and learn from it. The expectations and rules of the community can make students feel like small children with how they are treated."
Freshman,4,"A great college with a absolutely wonderful Digital Media Arts program. Not a lot to do in the town surrounding the school and generally quiet weekends, but a great education and great opportunities within the major classes."
Sophomore,4,"I love the small class size and how connected I feel with my classmates and professors. One on one conversations with peers and professionals are vital to honing one’s craft, and that’s one of Huntington’s greatest strengths.  While the food isn’t the greatest, there still is good community and resources for connection that make the campus homey, safe, and pleasant to live on. Also, as the the campus is small, the rooms are rather large and housing is very nice!"
Junior,4,"I loved the community all over. My first year experience was nothing like I expected, but was more than I could have asked for. The professors were so willing to get to know the students (and continue to be so willing), the upper classmen were wonderful to be around and really took the first year students under their wing. The food was pretty good at our Student Center, however not so much at the main dining area (the cookies were always fabulous though!). I truly enjoyed all of the opportunities there were to get involved and get to know your peers. I wasn't too overwhelmed with what to join because they made it clear what was going to happen. I was also able to obtain a job on campus while keeping my grades up. Overall, the experience has been wonderful and I'm excited to attend there again in the fall!"
Freshman,4,Huntington University is a wonderful university! Everyone on campus is super friendly and the overwhelming spirt of Jesus flows through this campus. I would recommend this campus to anyone that wants a small but wonderful campus.
Senior,4,"This is a great Christian Campus and University with a close knit, family, type culture. The only thing that i would say can be improved on this campus is the outdated administration and the overused, under-maintained facilities."
Junior,4,I'm glad I was able to come to Huntington University! I met so many people that are so important to me. I've learned a lot for my craft and how I can apply my craft to everyday experiences. I would recommend this experience for those seeking a purpose driven life.
Junior,4,I would like to see more students from around the world..it is not all about black or white. Let there me more spices in the soup! I would also love food from other countries outside the Americas. Maybe Caribbean food. Nigerian food. Ghanaian and Ethiopian food. Indian food. Middle Eastern food. East Asian foods. Finally I would like subjects that talk honestly about other cultures. Education is key but most people don't know about other non western countries.
College Sophomore,4,Easy to work with the professor
College Sophomore,4,They work hard to help find a job with my skill set
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe here
College Sophomore,4,We have a very competitive league.
College Junior,4,Hall life is fun and civil
Recent Alumnus,4,IT INSTILLS INTO STUDENT ALOT  OF KNOWLEDGE IN THEIR AREAS OF DECIPLINES OR THEIR CHOSEN COUSES TO MAKE THEM NOT ONLY EFFECTIVE STUDENTS  BUT PROBLEM SOLVING STUDENTS.
College Junior,4,"I'd like to see campus security and building security increased. There's no locked doors, camera or anything like that"
College Junior,4,We don't have Greek life on campus
College Sophomore,4,"The housing situations are pretty great. Of course, everyone gets those people that they don't really connect with on any level and it can be hard to talk to them, but there's also the people that you bond with and form close friendships with as well. This will happen no matter where you go to school or what hall you end up in."
Recent Alumnus,4,Everything has gone smoothly for me academically. My only minor complaint is that professor's office hours always seem to fall on times when I have classes.
Recent Alumnus,4,"If we have a ""drug scene"" at all, I am completely unaware of it. I have never heard anyone talk unironically about taking drugs."
College Freshman,4,No parties or anything like that. But we play games and socialize sometimes even study
College Freshman,4,"We have foriengers every year. Many different people

Living among us"
College Freshman,4,No one really drinks or does drugs. There are a slim few who will find it if they want it but it's never done on campus. It never really happens
College Freshman,4,"College is like a community and is somewhat easygoing. There is still tons of stress to deal with, though."
Recent Alumnus,4,I personally have not heard of any crime on campus and have seen no reason to feel unsafe.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Class sizes differ vastly depending on whether or not a lot of students need the course, but the bigger classes tend to have the easier workloads. The instructors are all good at answering questions and making the course materials clear."
Recent Alumnus,4,The animation program in which I am enrolled is excellent and provides a lot of practical experience. The school also gives ample opportunities for extra curricular activities. Students and staff are generally friendly and caring.
College Sophomore,4,All the professors I have had want you to succeed. They want to help you in any way they can and try and make time to speak with you. They all know what they are talking about. They all have a different style so some professors will not be for everyone. It is a good idea to talk to them or others that hae had them before taking their class. For most Classes the size is about the same size as a typical high school class. Some core classes are larger at 60ish max and others can be as small as 10 people.
College Sophomore,4,While I have some disagreements with the minor rules on campus i am still very happy here.
College Junior,4,I love my school because it is a place to easily grow in my faith. It also provides me with great opportunities to serve others and to find what I am interested in in further careers and schooling options.
College Freshman,4,The housing is nice and the community is even nicer.
College Freshman,4,The facilities are very nice for not only the athletes but also the average student.
College Freshman,4,"Internships are great, the employment rate for students in my degree are great as well."
College Freshman,4,"Professors are amazingly friendly and talented! All I have interacted with have been very involved and successful in their field. 

Courses are easy to understand, some professors would specifically adapt learning to your personal learning style."
College Freshman,4,"I love sports and the on campus varsity sports events are well supported. Also the teams support each other; the men's basketball team will make sure to be there for the female basketball games and vice versa. Same for soccer, the volleyball team is also well supported once it's on campus or close to campus. 

Off-campus games are poorly attended."
College Freshman,4,There's been times when I'm stressed and I'll go out walking around campus at 12:30 or 1:00 in the morning. On my walks I always see either campus police or city police patrolling keeping an eye out. I feel very safe on campus. Nothing bad has happened on campus to my knowledge and I don't believe it will. HU is in a small town with a low crime rate I think. It can be boring sometimes but you just gotta create your own fun.
College Freshman,4,I was struggling in my sociology class and I went to the professor. We sat down and went over my previous exams and I was advised to ask for a tutor which I did. That helped me a lot in the class. Class sizes are small which is nice because it allows the professor to really get to know his/her class. The professors and pretty much any faculty on campus are there to see the students succeed and they will help in anyway they can. HU is a big family. It's a home away from home.
College Freshman,4,We have a career center that helps with getting jobs on campus and they help find internships. I personally haven't looked for internships into my career choice but I'm sure with their help I can find something. Alumni are there a lot. It's like they never want to leave it's pretty cool. They will bring alumni in for concerts and all kinds of stuff. Graduates are always welcome on campus. It's a place everyone loves.
College Freshman,4,I love where I live. I've had some problems and my Resident Director and RA were very helpful and guided me on what to do. I love living in the dorms it's an older building but it has charm and the feeling of home to it.
College Freshman,4,I personally don't go to many sporting events. But from what I hear they are pretty fun. I believe they are doing a some type of basketball thing where if you shoot the ball in the basket from so many feet you get money towards tuition. It's pretty cool.
College Freshman,4,The community is amazing. I have great leaders and the professors are welling to help in any way they can. I've even had dinner at a professors home. It is like another family/home for me. I love it.
College Junior,4,The professors I have had thus far have been great! They really and genuinely care about us as students. They want to see us grow and they are willing to help in anyway possible. They also become great friends and mentors! I have a professor who is a mentor and is guiding me in life and helping me mature in the bible and living the christian life. He has been a great help. I never had such great professors at my old school. I love it here so much.
College Junior,4,I am in the ministry program. I am and will be taking classes that will help me grow spiritually and morally and I am ready for that. It is something I have always wanted to do. So far I have taken a number of courses but one class in particular was philosophy and it was such a good class. It made me think about how I live and approach life and how to be a better person. My foundation of christian ministry class has helped me grow spiritually and i learned a lot about church culture and denominations. I grew a lot in the Word in that class as well.
College Junior,4,So far I have been given internships to check out and they are so easy to get. The school is all about getting experience and I wouldn't change that. I love how they want to prepare us and watch us grow.
College Junior,4,Health and safety is all great on campus. So far everything is going great. I do like how the school is ready for any problem and ready to tackle it head on and are not afraid to address it.
College Junior,4,My experience has been a good one.  The staff and faculty are usually available and do a great job getting back to you when they are not.  I would recommend this school if you are looking for a good school with a Christian overtone.
College Freshman,4,This school has been a great first college experience and I hope to be able to continue going here.
College Sophomore,4,"I love Huntington because of the small campus and friendly faculty that are always there to help you. I'm not a huge fan of the actual meal plans (required; food is not bad) or the chapel requirement per semester or the Community Life Agreement (no drinking anytime off campus during time here, no R-rated movies on campus). However, I feel as if I've grown as a person and I think Huntington is a great school to be at."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the fact that it is Christ centered. Everyone is so kind and caring and you don't get that from most schools. The professors are here to help us with anything, not just grading papers and passing us. They care for us as they would their own kids. I feel safe walking on campus anytime day or night."
College Junior,4,"While providing a great community on campus in the dorms and outside of it Huntington is not without fault.Various issues surrounding their mandatory ""chapel attendance"" have created issues for the students.It is quite troubling that in my schedule I have to fit in 30 attendances within 3 and a half months every year. Other than that the academics are great for the most part unless you are a part of a ""weaker department"" like business. The school's pride and joy is its Digital Media Arts program which is one of the best in the region. As a counter-point the school looks to squeeze every dollar out of you by being coerced into a meal contract with the Sodexo Corporation which forces all on campus students to have a meal plan. I have access to a fully stocked kitchen and refrigerator and know fully well how to cook yet have to play 2100 dollars every semester for 3 and a half months of bland and low quality food. The diversity on campus is also pretty lacking. My freshman year there were 5 african-american students on campus maybe 6 with 2 Indian students. Ever since then the college has been going all out to recruit large student populations from south american and Jamaica in an effort ""to increase diversity"" It has done very little to achieve that so far as most of these people barely speak English. The people are what really make it for me here as there are all sorts. However if you are ever unlucky enough to get stuck in the wrong residential hall get ready for social exclusion."
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of chain restaurants and fast food places such as McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Wendy's, Applebee's, etc... But there are also a lot of local places that are really nice and there are enough of them to keep a good variety."
College Junior,4,"It's a Christian college so there are quite a bit of rules that you have to follow. You are required to sign a community life agreement where it says you can't drink on or off campus, no rated R movies, etc... I don't agree with everything but I don't think it takes away from the fun of the campus."
College Junior,4,The are more than willing to help anyone out and will go out of their way to find ways to get you here or help you stay here.
College Freshman,4,"A lot of students here are involved in sports, and our school spirit is about average. Our facilities could most definitely be better, but we can deal with what we have right now too."
College Freshman,4,It is pretty great. The atmosphere is very lively and open. It is a little costly and the laundry room is in an awkward place but other than that I find that it is quite enjoyable living on campus.
College Freshman,4,I feel like campus is the safest place for me to be. We have campus police that are always around. We are in a good and friendly community.
Niche User,2,Certain profs were amazing. Others were horrible. Athletics are poor and more demanding than a D1 NCAA school and it’s not even comparable. The chapel requirements are crazy. Student life is awful and the rumor mill is worse than the small town a came from. Not accepting at all and the people are extremely rude.
College Sophomore,2,We don't have Heeek life.
College Freshman,2,Not very diverse at all.
College Freshman,2,"Parking is very strict, whether it is a vacation week or not, you still get a ticket and they are not lenient. Visitation in dorms is only like 3 different times a week and they are very short. It is pointless to have somebody come visit when you are only allowed like three hours to actually visit."
College Freshman,2,"The Dining Commons has an awful variety of food. I would much rather eat Pizza Hut everyday than eat in the Dining Commons, but I don't have many options."
College Freshman,2,"It is a very strict campus when it comes to many things, like alcohol, drugs of any kind, and members of the opposite gender visiting dorms."
College Junior,2,"I would think that by most standards, Huntington is not a diverse campus.  For one, it is very conservative.  Huntington does not allow there to be a LGBT community on campus.  Even though there are a handful of students with varying sexual orientations, there keep quite because their are not accepted by the University.  Also, because of Huntington's location, we do not have much ethnic diversity.  However, we are all united in our beliefs Christians."
College Freshman,2,"Indiana is very bipolar; it can be sunny, then it could get get Cloudy and start pouring rain. In my past semester here already, we had a tornado warning, flash flood warnings, Windy days, humid days and over 30in. of snow in one month. It is four seasons"
College Freshman,2,"It is so mass catered, and it shows ( or tastes ) we have a dining commons, basically a subway, and a sudo pizza place on campus, the sub place is the best, because meat on bread is pretty hard to mess up."
College Freshman,2,"there is no bus. Huntington has a van for transportation, but its a community thing and unless your disabled or elderly its expensive. walking is possible, but the mall is about a mile off campus, same with down town, and the businesses are all across the highway."
College Freshman,2,"Freshman who have a car don't have it easy, we have specific lots that we can park in based on our year (and faculty staff status) and freshman have one lot, almost off campus, and we are pretty big campus wise, sophomores don't have it much better, but they at least might be closer to they dorm if they arnt in the far one by freshman lot. and when you do finally get that junior/senior status, all the spots are gone when you need them."
College Junior,2,You only have transportation if you have a car or know someone who has one.
College Junior,2,There are parties around but I've never been to one.
College Junior,2,Some lots have a horrible set up. The walking distance isn't too bad though.
College Senior,2,There really isn't much greek life. There are frats and sororities but they really do not do much together.
College Freshman,2,"I received financial aid, scholarships, and grants to come to Huntington but it still wasn't enough to keep me there for my sophomore year. The financial aid office is supportive and wants to help you, but sometimes it's not enough. Unless your pretty well-to-do, you absolutely have to spend time filling out online scholarship and grant applications. Huntington is a private Christian college, so it's pricey. But if you work hard at getting scholarships, grants, and loans, then you'll have a much better chance of lasting."
College Senior,2,There are no buses avaible on campus or in the community. Huntington University is in a small country town in Indiana.
College Sophomore,2,"Small Town – Huntington is a great place, but students often suffer from boredom. It's a small town, so there isn't always a lot to do. Many students go home on the weekends."
College Sophomore,2,"well i will say the weather here is really changing. so far i have had some really good warm days at this time of the year. the winters can get pretty bad here, but the worst weather here is the hard cold rainy days. sometimes depending on the weather i will feel like being lazy all day, i have no motivation doing anything. when it's nice outside i would go and sit outside to do homework"
College Freshman,2,"Not Good – There is not near enough ""O"" spots in the parking lots.  The spaces in the P/O lot outside of Livingston are way bigger than necessary.  If the spots were cut down to normal size, 5-7 more cars would fit in the lot.  There are never enough ""O"" spots available."
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life
College Freshman,1,Huntington University does not have greek life.
College Senior,1,Can be very cold during the winter here. School doesn't do the best to keep sidewalks cleared of ice and snow. Can be difficult to get around town as well since the city manages to plow snow onto sidewalks.
College Senior,1,Very strict policy on drinking. Absolutely no drinking on or off campus even if you are over 21. Expected to attend chapel 30 times each semester.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have Greek Life at all since we are a Christian University. However, there are many other opportunities to get involved on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Currently our internet is pretty sketchy and slow and the printers suck but we have free printing. Next year though, we all have to pay a $250 technology fee to cover new printers and upgraded wireless network in addition to paying for printing if we print more than 1000 pages per semester."
College Freshman,1,"I'm not a fan of most of the ""scenes"" at Huntington. It's mostly a crowd of people who all act and believe the same way. However, if you're into that, the Olympiad and other SAB events are good."
College Freshman,1,"There is almost no ""nightlife"" at Huntington. Being a Christian college, it is a dry campus. They take this VERY seriously. The activities are normally religion centered, honestly, pompous and annoying."
College Freshman,1,"There is no partying at Huntington. After midnight most things settle down. The town itself offers little entertainment. Fort Wayne has some clubs, and a hookah bar, but that is frowned upon by the University so it is risky to travel there. Most students play pool, ping pong, or watch movies on their down time. Can get very boring and repetitive. However, it is what you make of it."
College Freshman,1,"The town of Huntington is mostly a decaying small town. The ""downtown"" is ghostly. Most of the students enjoy the major shopping centers located very  close to the University. Most students stay on campus, or travel to Fort Wayne."
College Freshman,1,"There are many different races and cultures represented on campus. However, the religious diversity and sexual diversity is non-existent. It is very rare to meet someone who is openly gay, or of a religion besides Christianity. Also, the majority of people are extremely conservative. The campus is very aware of it's majority in conservative Christians, and caters exclusively to that kind. If you are looking for a school that is accepting of LBGTQ (this school does not allow homosexuality at all, it actually forbids it in the Student Handbook) or if you are not a Christian nor a conservative, then you should really not select this school as you will not feel comfortable. The school does enroll non-Christians, but coming from an atheist who attended HU, you will feel out of place and sometimes judged for your lack of belief."
College Sophomore,1,"Conservative, Christian University – While Huntington University has many students from different cultures our student body is mostly comprised of white, conservative Christians.  Having said that, there is very little tension at our university due to any cultural/racial diversity because we advertise as being strongly committed to the Christian faith and that is where we are united."
College Junior,1,"Workout Facility – The current weight room at Huntington University is extremely small, to the point that if there are more that four other people in the room that it is crowded. They have plans to make the room the larger but I will not see that happen in my time there. Other than the weight room it is a decent athletic center."

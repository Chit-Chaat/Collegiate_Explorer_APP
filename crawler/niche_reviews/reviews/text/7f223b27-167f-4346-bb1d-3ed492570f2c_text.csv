Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and the basketball coaches are so great. I'm on a basketball scholarship and I feel part of a family.
Sophomore,5,Heard that it’s about the same as Uphoenix.  Save your money take accounting classes online at 30% the cost
Sophomore,5,I decided to attend Bentley because it offered me the best. A great sports environment and a scholarship that will help me a lot.
Alum,5,Great place to get educated!  Now approaching the end of my career and Bentley absolutely set me up for success!
Niche User,5,Bentley University has the best internship programs and the opportunities students receive there is phenomenal. The only thing I wish for them to change is to offer better food.
Sophomore,5,"College is a value proposition. You go there and work hard, pay for it and then see what it brings you. Bentley is an amazing place if you are smart enough to take advantage of what it has to offer. If you are going to college for good food, the arts, parties, big sports and fun....it's probably not a fit for you. There are plenty of other schools that will give you that. However, if you want to start life with a salary that can comfortably pay off your student loans, and/or give yourself a nice start in life....Bentley is hard to beat!"
Sophomore,5,The small classroom setting allows the student to create a better bond with the professor.  The buildings and campus are very clean.
Freshman,5,My experience so far at Bentley University has been excellent. All of my professors so far have been very good and usually will go out of their way for students to succeed. The worst part is the cost of attending.
Niche User,5,The admissions office is awesome to work with on financing your education. The facilities are incredible and offer students many great opportunities to develop their skills. The staff is highly qualified and helpful. The professors really help students prepare for their careers.
Graduate Student,5,I like the way everything is organised. From Open House to starting classes. The staff is very helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I love how Bentley University has a closed off campus feel but is also so close and connected to the city of Boston. The faculty are always there for you whenever you may be having difficulty in a class and the schools Career Development Program do an amazing job of preparing students for Internships and how to enter the workforce. Additionally, when it comes time for graduation and finding a job, the Professors are all very well connected, and if you have a strong relationship with them, can help you get an interview at a company you love."
Junior,5,"Really good business school. Food in the dining hall needs to be better, especially since the majority of students live in dorms and are required to have a meal plan."
Niche User,5,"When touring Bentley University I felt like I was at home. The students smiled at you and the faculty made you feel welcome. I felt like I could comfortably ask students and employees questions about the campus. Since that tour I have not found another college that had the same effect on me, no other colleges have had the same welcoming atmosphere when you are on campus. Bentley is an amazing school and I would highly suggest it to anyone that is interested in studying business."
Freshman,5,"Bentley University has exceeded my expectations thus far.  I'm only a Freshman at the school, however I have met some amazing friends, and everyone on campus is very friendly.  The academics are challenging but I know I am getting a great education.  The food choices could be better and the social scene is average, but if you have a good group of friends it can make for an unforgettable experience"
Freshman,5,"The academics are great, the campus is nice, the professors and staff are amazing, the party life is ok but not always perfect."
Freshman,5,"Overall I could not be happier with my choice. The opportunities are great here. If you take advantage of all the clubs, talks, and activities you will learn a lot. The food is not amazing but you can use discretionary funds. The campus is very nice. Dorms are good. If you are interested in business and are highly motivated this is the school for you! Even if you are not interested in business the skills you learn here will apply to whatever you do in the future."
Senior,5,"Bentley was the best decision I ever made. As a current Senior, Bentley has 100% prepared me for my future career endeavors. Although I am sad to Graduate, I will forever cherish  the friends I made, the experiences I had, and the knowledge I gained ."
Sophomore,5,"Bentley University does a great job of preparing the students for their careers in business. This University offers rigorous academic courses that challenge the students to think creatively and work in groups to collaborate on ideas and expand each other's knowledge. Additionally, the professors are very knowledgable and are able to offer students with applicable advice for their future careers in business. Overall, Bentley University is a great business school and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is considering a career in business."
Sophomore,5,"The professors, staff, and administration take really good care of their students. I feel welcome, safe, and heard on campus. 
There's a vibrant student body with plenty of social, academic, and cultural opportunities to learn and grow and share as a community."
Sophomore,5,"Bentley is a very great campus, that has a great atmosphere. The people are friendly, and the professors care about you. Overall, a very underrated small business school and is definitely worth it!"
Sophomore,5,I love all of the things avalible at Bentley.  There are so many ways to get involved and ways to learn even more.  The staff and professors genuinly care about the students' wellbeing.
Sophomore,5,I love my school! The academics are incredible; the professors truly care about their students and how they're doing. The social life is great as well! Bentley is small enough where you see many friendly faces throughout the day yet large enough that you see people you don't know very often as well.
Freshman,5,"Bentley university has great programs, professors, and location! I will be an incoming freshman in the fall, and can not wait to get started on my path to law school!"
Freshman,5,Great friends and connections! Study abroad! Fun campus! Small but not too small. Close to Boston and most of all a great job virtually guaranteed there for you when you are finished!
Niche User,5,"I love that it is ranked as the best campus in the USA! also, one of the best business and economics schools!"
Niche User,5,It was amazing! The people here are incredible- they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Their technology and networking is increasing at an outstanding rate.
Alum,5,"One of the best business schools in the state and country. The faculty is extremely knowledgable. Most importantly, the school will help you get an internship and you will find a great job after you graduate. My friends and I all had at least 3 job offers in our field at graduation time."
Junior,5,"I think Bentley has incredible resources and has a great Career Services staff.  They are committed to helping students find opportunities for internships/full-time offers after graduation and ensure students are prepared for interviews.  Academically, professors care a lot and are always willing to help!"
Sophomore,5,This school is amazing. Professors in many departments are super dedicated to their field and their students. The gen-ed teachers are definitely worse but still manageable. Econ department especially is amazing.
Junior,5,"Bentley University is the best college! Not only do the professors prepare you for the working world, they are also great connections to have. Most of them have made great names for themselves in the business world and are more than willing to guide you in the direction you choose. Being on the track & field team is also a great experience because everyone is dedicated and helps each other with everyday activities to personal issues."
Sophomore,5,Coming to Bentley has shown to be the best decision I could've made for my future.  They are one of the best in career services and i'm highly confident in the bright future Bentley is preparing me for.
Sophomore,5,I love everything about bentley! They really do prepare you to be successful. There's so many resources and connections available.
Senior,5,I love Bentley University. I have gained so many career and aspirational opportunities through my three years here and I am confident that I will leave Bentley prepared to be in the work force.
College Freshman,5,The job placement is in the top
College Freshman,5,I am not worried about being prepared for future
College Freshman,5,"I would choose it again, challenging AND fun!"
College Freshman,5,So many students have internships and underclassmen and they often get job offerings from the companies they interned with. There are always networking activities on campus with employers recruiting.
College Senior,5,"Favorite Experiences: Sport games

The technology in the classrooms is amazing!

I would choose my school again"
College Freshman,5,Bentley Police really care about the students.
College Freshman,5,I feel that our school provides us with the best safety and makes us feel at ease. There is good lighting everywhere on campus so that nothing can easily go unseen. As well as having security that is constantly montoring the campus to make sure nothing suspicious or dangerous is taking place.
College Freshman,5,"Bentley Univesity is very susseful in providing jobs to its graduated students. 98 percent of undergraduate student receive a job with six months of graduating. The average starting salary is $49000 dollars, which in my opinion is a very good number. This reassures me that my degree at Bentley University is well worth it."
College Freshman,5,"The classes size match the school's small population. This allows for teachers to work with students more adequately and provide one on one help if needed. The teachers are very knowledgeable on their designated classes, and prepare students very well."
College Freshman,5,"Bentley University is all about preparing you for the real world. They strive to give students all tools and knowledge necessary for proper implementation into the real business world. Since the university is smaller than most, it has a sense of intimacy. This allows for each student to know a wider spectrum of diverse facilty and students, fostering better relationships. I highly believe that Bentley is well worth the money, and that my experience hear is the best preparation that I could achieve for my future. I am very satisfied and look coward to spending another three years here."
College Freshman,5,As a girl I'm happy to say I feel so safe walking around by myself at night
College Freshman,5,"Professors really care about you, I love having small classes"
College Freshman,5,"Felt like home right away, best decision I've ever made"
College Freshman,5,"Bentley is extremely safe and I have never heard of anything bad happening on campus. Drugs and alcohol are present, but that's like all campuses and it is definitely less prominent here. There is little to no crime and students feel very safe on campus even late at night."
College Freshman,5,"Bentley offers a well-rounded and wholesome education. With a small class size and professors with real-life experiences, you are sure to receive a fine education here. Students are expected to work hard, but if you put in the effort, you will be extremely successful coming out of Bentley."
College Freshman,5,Bentley is very well known in the corporate world. Many companies specifically search for Bentley students knowing they received top notch education and are prepared for the business world. Alumni are always connecting on Linkedin and are extremely helpful with regard to helping you find your way. The career services at Bentley are the best and you will leave this school with a great career.
College Freshman,5,"Bentley University is slowly becoming a more popular school for students, and for good reason! I am currently finishing up my first year at Bentley and couldn't be more pleased with how my experience went. At first, Bentley wasn't even a possibility for me, in fact, at the bottom of my list! Then, when I finally decided to take a tour, everything changed. Even just a few hours on the campus made me feel so at home (cheesy but true). Everyone at Bentley is dedicated, ambitious, and hard working individuals all with the dream of becoming a successful business men/women. It is great to be with a group of like minded individuals because it makes your education all the more exciting knowing exactly where you want to be in four years. Bentley also offers liberal studies majors which allow you to explore much more than just your business education and you can take classes in other topics that interest you. This school is also top notch with professors who have had years of experience with well known and reputable companies along with state of the art technology that most schools don't have. Although Bentley is a small school, the social scene is still amazing! There's so many different clubs and orgs to be a part of, you'll never get bored! Granted the party scene isn't what you'd expect at a large state school, but there is always something to do on the weekends! Along with that, with such close proximity to Boston, you can't go wrong! Bentley University is the perfect school for a driven student who wants to learn in a competitive environment along with receive a well-rounded and experiential education."
College Sophomore,5,Joining a sorority has opened a lot of doors for me. i have made new friends and am starting to network for my job after college.
College Sophomore,5,"Bentley is the perfect fit for me. I have a balance of classes, activities and social life."
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Bentley University! It has offered me numerous opportunities with internships and exploring the many majors before choosing a definite.
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love my school. If I had to change anything it would be a slightly bigger school with more big time sports. Otherwise, everything else is perfect."
College Junior,5,"I love the campus, suburbian but close enough to Boston. A lot of divrsity in courses, students, teachers and programs. Great resources."
College Senior,5,I love Bentley and am very happy I chose the school. I am a student-athlete and I love that combination. Bentley challenges me academically and athletically. I would never wish to have attended any place else.
College Freshman,5,I really like living on campus for the simple fact that you can live with/near your friends! It's also a great place to meet new people of your same class and it's not in a bad location either to everything else on campus.
College Freshman,5,Lots of options in Harvard Square and Boston.
College Freshman,5,I got so much financial aid from Bentley; one of the reasons why I enrolled here.
College Freshman,5,"I have yet to have a bad experience with the administration, they are always so nice and helpful."
Freshman,4,They quickly adjusted to online learning and provided resources to us to help us stay in-touch with updates.
Alum,4,"Bentley is a great school to call home. Wonderful classroom environment, responsive administration, strong community, exciting athletics and great academic reputation."
Niche User,4,"It seemed like a nice school with a great education program. The school did not show me too much of what the inside of the buildings looked like when I took a tour, but I am sure it can not be too bad"
Niche User,4,"I liked how the college was big enough to see a new face everywhere but not too big where you would get lost. I also like how it is a business specific school, I want to go for marketing so Bentley will definitely help me in this major."
Freshman,4,What I experienced first hand was how organized the structure is. And also the warm gesture I received from the admission office. The office was always ready to give nice response to my request. Although I couldn't secure an admission last year I am persuaded to reapply this year.
Senior,4,"Bentley is great especially if you are a focus driven individual. The environment is that of Harvard, Yale, Cornell or any other of the Ivy Leagues! Students are gravely concerned about their grades mostly. It is very intense academically but can be a special place once you can balance and maintain as well as have control and restraint. If you are into getting the best return on your investment, this is the place for you. Bentley is very well known in the Northeast region and has a lot of prestige behind its name. You are more than certain to obtain a job once it's on your resume!"
Sophomore,4,"As a student of color at Bentley University, it is very hard to say that I see many people that look like me and that the university is diverse, because it truly isn't. While that may be the case, the college sets up great programs and clubs for students of color to connect with people similar to them, a great way to make up for the lack of diversity.

While academics at Bentley is tough, it is very appreciated, as the school sets you for post-college, with the additional help of job recruiters on campus, that help with finding a summer internship or post-grad, a concern that many students have.

In terms of everyday life at Bentley, the food isn't so good. While one or two days of the week are filled with many delicious food options, the rest of the week can be barely edible. In terms of late night dining, no food options are open after 1 AM, which sucks after a weekend of staying in due to the campus poor party life"
Junior,4,I love that Bentley challenges you. It puts you in an environment where everyone is driven to succeed and everyone supports one another.
Freshman,4,Good school and education. Bentley has top of the line professors who are all well accomplished. Social life and party scene is a complete joke. Friday and Saturday nights there are only 1-2 big frat parties going on and you need a 2 to 1 girl to guy ratio to get in and the schools ratio is 70% guys 30% girls. If you don't just want to sit in your room and study all week then go somewhere else. For a school in Boston the party scene is laughable not to mention every hot girl has 5 guys right next to her.
Sophomore,4,The only thing I do not like about Bentley is the lack of diversity. Also the food is not appetizing at all.
Senior,4,Bentley is an inclusive community for the most part and has a beautiful campus. The four years I spent there I fell more and more in love with the campus.
Sophomore,4,Very strong career services and very strong academics. Students are all awesome however the party scene isn't nearly as good as a lot of other schools. The proximity to Boston is awesome and the professors are phenomenal. The new rink is an incredible addition as well!
Freshman,4,Good academics; if you major in Accounting or Finance the school resources are very helpful starting freshman year; not much diversity; situated in a suburban area and hard to get anywhere without a car
Senior,4,I love the competitive nature of Bentley. It pushes me to be a better person and student. The students here that I have met here have changed my perspective on different aspects to trying something new in business
Graduate Student,4,"Bentley University is well known for its education in business management. Its reputation lies in the education standard, world class technology."
Alum,4,"The university is a great place for one to find what they want in life... as well as don't want. You must take the initiative to make the school your own. The more your put into your academics and social life, the better your experience will be."
Freshman,4,"I though Bentley University provided an atmosphere that highlighted education yet never forgets that school is not all consuming.  I enjoyed the style of classes as well as the placement.  Overall, I felt the campus was welcoming and a place where I could learn."
Senior,4,"I am a rising senior at Bentley University and as far as overall value goes I couldn't be happier with my decision to attend. The professors are intelligent men and women with real world business experience who want to help you achieve your goals. Bentley invests in its students by giving them all the tools they need to be prepared for the real world. 

The one thing Bentley lacks is the ""traditional college experience"" you would get from going to a larger state school. Athletics are not closely followed, and most student are more concerned with getting ahead than having a good time."
Senior,4,"I like the environment at Bentley University, even though it is a small university composed of 4,000 students you will always get to meet new people while seeing familiar faces around. Something the they could improve on is the cafeteria food. Overall Bentley is a great university."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Bentley has been a positive one. The class sizes are small, so you have close relationships with your professors and they are able to help you immensely. The Career Services is one of the best in the nation, and you can almost guarantee a job after your four years."
Freshman,4,The Bentley campus is ideal.  There is plenty of green spaces and nature all around campus.  The campus is in a nice area away from the city.  Bentley runs a shuttle service from the campus to Harvard Square which is quite convenient and a great option for every student.  The academics at Bentley are through and enjoyable.  This definitely is a top notch business school.
Sophomore,4,Bentley is a really good school that provides a lot of connections and possibilities to succeed in the future.
College Freshman,4,"There are a wide variety of courses to take and the quality of the courses is great as well. Professors really care about your education too, even when you take a course completely unrelated to business."
College Freshman,4,"Bentley Alumni are great because they will go to great lengths to help out current bentley students, and I believe bentley has a great network with them and also other recruiters."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are really nice, although the process of choosing a room might be a tad difficult. The dorm rooms are very spacious, and depending on where on campus you want to live, there's always some major facility or academic building near it."
College Freshman,4,"Academically, it is one of the best schools you can go to for business education."
College Freshman,4,The school talks a lot about people getting internships but I have yet to see this in action. As for jobs I think these are easier to find on campus with available resources.
College Freshman,4,"Tough because they know everything, but very nice"
College Freshman,4,"The trees are fun, stairs suck, AC is awesome!"
College Freshman,4,Campus safety and security are always patrolling. I feel personally safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,Bentley University is unique because it combines a business curriculum with a general education curriculum for students starting in their first year.
College Senior,4,"I went to a hockey team the other day and there was a lot of student involvement and fan support! Also, Flex, the school mascot, was there, which shows a high level of school spirit."
College Freshman,4,I would choose the school again because the atmosphere at Bentley is outstanding.
College Freshman,4,I was lucky enough to be placed in a great dorm for freshman. It is close to all of my classes and to the cafeteria. My roomate is great and the room is average size. Everyone on my floor gets along and things tend to run very smoothly.
College Freshman,4,"We are competitive division II school in almost all sports. Often with successful seasons. While our girls basketball team and men's hockey except in division I. Despite our athletic success, Bentley likes to place a priority on academic success, knowing that it is extremely important."
College Freshman,4,"Hockey games are big, other sports not so much"
College Freshman,4,"Bentley offers on-campus all four years which is great. Many students prefer to live on campus because of this convenience, also it is expensive to live off-campus. Freshman year dorms are average, better than most schools but obviously not great. Suites and apartments for upperclassmen are fairly nice, some better than others, but no matter what you'll end up with a good housing the only difference really is location. The housing on lower is nicer quality, but isn't as good of a location as those on upper. As far as North Campus, the apartments are beautiful, the downfall being you need to shuttle/drive to campus to get to class."
College Sophomore,4,"Bentley is a great place to be because of the strong academic standing the university has as well as its close location to Boston. The professors here are talented and passionate about their field and they are always willing to help and get to know students, especially because class sizes are small enough for that to be a possibility. Bentley also has a beautiful campus with plenty of outdoor spaces to enjoy in the warmer months. Overall, my experience here has been wonderful and the community is very welcoming."
College Sophomore,4,"Bentley revolves around business, and does it well. Facilities are pristine and technology can't be beat. However, social life can be somewhat shallow at times, especially if you don't come from a background that the common Bentley student comes from. For you education and career, it's great. Also, our school spirit is noticeably lacking, and nobody cares about our sports teams."
College Sophomore,4,Bentley took some getting used to as it was a small school and I wished it were bigger. It's also kind of hard to go anywhere without a car so not having a feasible source of transportation was hard. The classes are great though. The professors are great at what they do and I have learned a lot from them. I really enjoy the people here and I always meet someone new even though it's a small school.
College Freshman,4,"At bentley, there are parties on campus and frats on fridays and saturdays. It's quite on any other night of the week."
College Freshman,4,"From bentley you can take a shuttle that will take you to Cambridge, Harvard Square. In Harvard Square I believe that there are multiple options as to places to go dinning and are conveniently close."
College Freshman,4,"As any other college, bentley university has rules that most be followed for everyone's safety."
College Freshman,4,"You can go to frat parties if you want, but lots of people have room-held parties you can go to. Some start Thursday nights, but most on Friday and Saturday nights. Campus is quiet at night Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday nights most of the time."
College Freshman,4,"Just don't party in freshman dorms, you get caught the most here since RA's do the most rounds"
College Freshman,4,"There are 3 freshman dorms. Trees is the oldest, then I believe Miller and Slade. Miller and Slade is obviously in better condition and thankfully I was placed in Slade. I didn't mind living in a dorm that was generally more quiet, even though there was a greater percentage of freshman that lived in Trees."
College Senior,4,I live off campus now and it is great!
College Senior,4,Love the restaurants around Waltham.
College Senior,4,They are strict but understand it is college.
College Senior,4,It has been an awesome experience.
College Senior,4,"There is no visitors policy at all, so anyone can stay on any night and for as long as they want (as long as your roommate(s) are okay with it!) Honestly you have to be way more worried about RAs than campus policy. I couldn't tell you the last time I saw a CP, other than hunting for cars to give parking tickets to."
College Senior,4,"Freshman year I lived in the Trees dorm, as the majority of freshman do at Bentley. Trees is known for its distinct but mysterious smell, so the building itself isn't great. However, I loved the social aspect of being able to walk to my friends' rooms without having to leave the building. It was close enough to classes (despite Bentley's crazy amount of stairs) to where getting to class on time was never an issue. I have lived on North Campus sophomore - senior year and I love it. North Campus often gets a bad reputation since it is disconnected from the rest of campus, and therefore often disconnected to the social atmosphere of Bentley. However, it is quiet housing and the buildings are top notch. The apartments are clean, up to date, and overall awesome."
College Freshman,4,"No complaints, other than if you don't have a car its hard to get to them."
College Freshman,4,"I got a lot of money to come here, which is helpful if you don't want to have mounds of debt when you leave."
College Freshman,4,"The food could be better, but there are a few edible options such as omelets at seasons, the salads at LaCava and late nite mozzarella sticks."
College Freshman,4,"My biggest class last semester had about 28 people, so the classes are small which is good. The professors actually get to know you."
College Freshman,4,Everyone that graduates from Bentley gets a job right away. Theres a huge career fair every semester.
College Freshman,4,"All of the professors know what they're talking about, and they're all very helpful and knowledgable. The advising center can help all the time with any questions you have, and RA's can help with academic related questions too."
College Freshman,4,"Registering for classes can be stressful, but the registrar's office can help with any class you need to get into. The workload isn't unbearable, but you'll definitely have to put some time into your homework every night. The group projects can suck depending on your group."
College Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman so this hasn't really had an impact on me yet, but I've heard so much about the career center and how helpful they are."
Sophomore,2,Transferred after two years even though I was on the Deans list.  Academically good but everything thing else was marginal.  No school spirit. Weekend parties were lame and food quality was terrible. The teachers were not really excited to teach here. And school diversity consists of NY NJ MA and ME. So  culturally not very energizing.  Unless you are there because you couldn’t afford elsewhere. Select a better university with a better overall experience.  My view is pretty consistent with all my friends.  The only difference is they are there on half price tuition.
Alum,2,"Mediocre school that costs too much. Students are very insecure. The school’s career services are overrated, unless you are an accounting major. Food is poor at best. Athletic facilities are not particularly outstanding. About 70% of professors are pretty terrible teachers, and about 50% genuinely could not care less about the average student.  You can make the best of the education, but employers and graduate schools will still look at “Bentley” on your resume and think it’s nothing special. Having a good GPA from an Ivy is better than a perfect GPA from Bentley."
Niche User,2,"If you are looking for a career in accounting or finance, definitely put Bentley on your list. However, here are some things that lead me to dislike Bentley. First, the types of students you will encounter are very entitled, rich, white kids looking to stay rich. I would say more than half of the student body is money focused and walks around with a sense of entitlement. Next, the party scene/social scene is lacking. Obviously you don't come to Bentley because you want to party but if you want to party on a weekend, good luck finding one. Lastly, you will run out of things to do on campus- you can't walk off campus, Waltham isn't that great of an area, and Boston is a lot farther than they say it is."
Senior,2,"Bentley is a school that trains very good employees. If you want to end up as an upper-middle class manager at an insurance or software sales company, go here. There is no emphasis on critical thinking, interdisciplinary studies across liberal arts, or freedom of thought and expression in general. If you do not fit the mold, you will not be supported, and you will not excel. 

There is very little room for 'exceptional' students to come out of Bentley due to the lack of thinking ability demonstrated by students. They can hardly write, read, or articulate themselves. Students are NOT well-rounded, grounded, kind, empathetic, thoughtful, or considerate. There is a culture of selfishness, the desire for money above all else, and a lack of basic morals and ethical thoughts. Graduates are exceptional at doing exactly what they are supposed to do when operating within large enterprise organizations. Outside of this,"
Freshman,2,"I went to Bentley for a year, but the college didn't really fit with my personality/ interests. The social atmosphere is very difficult to get into, you have to actively search for good people. If you love accounting and finance this is your school."
Junior,2,Great career service but not a very diverse campus. Not so much school spirit like I hoped. Very cliquey and self-interested.
Freshman,2,"Bentley's reputation in Boston is just another school in the area. The school hypes about itself way too much. A lot of busy work too.
The professors are great."
Freshman,2,"Bentley's atmosphere consists of a giant high school, not very fond of it. The campus also lacks diversity. The online homework (LearnSmart) required in some classes consists of busy work. 
However, the professors really do care about about your success so take advantage of them. 
Left this school to pursue my academic passions at a different institution."
Freshman,2,The career services is very good and they really try to give students many opportunities to find jobs. The academic focus is narrow and any student not majoring in accounting or finance is at a disadvantage.
College Freshman,2,Not a big fraternity guy.
College Freshman,2,"It is based on academic credits, so those who came in with lots of credits get first pick every year. High school credits should not effect senior year housing."
College Sophomore,2,The food in Boston and off campus is great but Bentley is cheap about the food
College Freshman,2,"The dorms at Bentley are so nice, there's really no reason to live off campus. Also, Waltham is very expensive and not the nicest town to live in, so most people stay on campus."
College Freshman,2,"People complain endlessly about Seasons. My big issue is that my sister goes to a similarly sized university and they have 6 dining halls whereas Bentley has one true dining hall where you swipe in and it's all you can it. The only eatable thing from breakfast is omelettes in my opinion, but I can't eat food that's been sitting under a heat lamp. During lunch and dinner there are 6 stations: custom sandwiches, burgers/hot dogs/chicken/fires, the ""hot line"", pasta, pizza and a station that changes daily but whatever is being served there is made to order. The only things that change are the hotline and the station where they make made to order food so if you don't like either of those you're stuck eating the same 4 items day after day. There is also a salad and dessert bar. Cereal, yogurt, bagels, bread and fruit are always available. I think we need more variety. Mien Bowl is also in Season's and can be eaten on a meal swipe. It's supposed to be a fresh stri-fry, but the vegetables are terrible because it's basically salad. We joke around and call it ""Five Star Seasons""."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly I don't see why anyone would move off. The dorms are really nice in comparison to other school, even the size is reasonable. I think living in Waltham would be more expensive overall with the added hassle of a commute."
College Freshman,2,Way too apathetic. Nobody cares about anything; it might as well be one of the adjectives listed around campus
College Freshman,2,I would not go to Bentley if I had to all over again
College Freshman,2,"I'm in a fraternity and it's an awesome time, but the Greek culture as a whole is extremely lacking. 3 sororities and 8 fraternities."
College Sophomore,2,Bentley has almost no school spirit but they are working on changing that a bit.  A big crowd did come out for the women's basketball team but only because they were the d2 national champions.  Our hockey team is d1 and can draw a crowd but the off campus rink deters students from  going.
College Freshman,2,The Bentley shuttle is fine but isn't great
College Freshman,2,Nothing is open late and the quality is never great
College Freshman,2,You arent in the city like you thin you are. People are drunk and high all the time and the food sucks. The only thing keeping me from saying its the worse is that half of the professors know what they are talking about.
College Freshman,2,Evey one is very cliquey and all the international kids stick together. There are like ten kids. So if you are gay DONT come here. You will get gay bashed. We are all white.
College Freshman,2,"So, there is no accessible public transportation on campus so you cant get anywhere without a car or taking the bentley shuttle to harvard. You cant have a car as a freshman BTW. And the shuttle to harvard is free but you literally have to fight to get on it. And the ride is a half hour just to get to harvard square then you have to take the t from there. Which is only two bucks each time you ride. Overall, once you come on campus you are pretty much stuck on campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"On campus you can occasionally find a good party. When there is good party off of campus it is beyond capacity and unless you are wasted its no fun because you can't move. Off campus, there is really only one bar within a reasonable distance that people attend and thats only on Thursdays, Skellig. It is this sketchy bar that survives off of Bentley students on Thursdays. So, if you are looking for a lot of fun parties, Bentley is not the place to go."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am all about school spirit and had I known how bad Bentley's was, I probably would not have come here. If you're wearing Bentley gear, you are either a Freshman or you participate in sports. Literally sucks. The athletic teams are halfway decent but a lot of the times people don't go to the games because they don't have school spirit."
College Freshman,2,A huge amount of white middle/upper class students. It's a business school so a lot of people are focused on getting rich
College Freshman,2,"I want to do into the artistic aspect of the business world such as Advertising, and Bentley does not cater to that at all. They are solely focused on Finance and Accounting. Freshmen teachers do not want to be there, teach off of power points and cannot answer questions about their own subject. Academics are very poor, not challenging at all."
College Freshman,2,There have been 2 muggings since I've been a student at Bentley (i'm a freshman) which has made me very uneasy. The male students also tend to assault girls that pass by with cat calls and derogatory and misogynistic remarks. The health center has been a big plus however. Very nice people and very willing to see you if you are on their good side.
College Freshman,2,"there are 2 computer labs on campus, one being a mac lab that is open at very weird hours, and, and the other is the library. You are hard pressed to find a computer that is open during the week."
College Sophomore,2,"Salad, Hamburgers, Hot Dogs, Sandwiches, Pizza. every day for lunch and dinner. pretty much the only option. absolutely no legitimate ethnic cuisine, the menu never changes whatsoever, any healthy options are thrown to the side and are barely palatable. Paying top money for food like this is a disgrace when the only meal plan included dining hall on campus closes at 8pm on the weekdays leaving students stranded with no where to eat but unhealthy expensive food outlets. Calling chicken dipped in barbecue sauce ""barbecued chicken,"" chicken dipped in soy sauce ""asian chicken,"" and other patronising ways to make the menu seem more varied constantly leave me wondering why Bentley would show off the dining halls on tours."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus housing is by no means terrible. Compared to other schools it is in fact quite nice, but for the amount of money that Bentley charges to live on campus, it feels like incoming students are getting the short end of the stick. Bentley is making a huge commitment towards ""sustainability"" which basically manifests itself in housing as lower water pressure for showers, raising housing costs to pay for these changes, and worst of all cycling air conditioning power throughout all new ""sustainably renovated"" buildings. What this means is that on a day where it's 95 degrees out, Bentley's computers dedicated to sustainability will only give 25% of a residence hall air-conditioning at a given time. This means for the rest of the residents sweating it out and heatstroke are the only options. Not really fair when Bentley's asking students to foot the bill for sustainability projects. Maybe masking energy cost reduction as sustainability should be a little more transparent. Bentley shouldn't be saving money on energy by denying air conditioning promised on the housing site, then asking students to pay for it and expecting students to thank them all at the same time."
College Sophomore,2,"Waltham and surrounding neighborhoods are cess pools, a joke, 25 mins from boston can be annoying, especially with awful shuttle service. Boston is alright for food."
College Junior,2,"Off-Campus housing is a farce at Bentley. Considering the location of the school, being right outside of Boston, the cost of living is insane. Apartments are very expensive (some of the poorly taken care of ones can cost $1000 a month) and are hard to come by."
College Freshman,2,"At Bentley it is pretty evident that you either need to drink or smoke. If you choose not to you better enjoy going out with your friends who do, otherwise you will be sitting in your room alone with no one to talk to. Drinking is a pretty big part of social life here at Bentley. The most popular drug other than alcohol is definitely marijuana. You will not really notice its prescience too often if you are not a smoker; however, if you do smoke you will realize how big its prescience actually is on campus."
College Freshman,2,"straight up meh, nothing to brag about: the showers in Trees suck "
College Freshman,2,"It never ceases to amaze me how stuck up and obnoxious girls here are; however, the guys are exactly similar..."
College Freshman,2,"A Lot of People Are Involved. Campus gets pretty wild on the weekends. People pretty much trash the dorms and there tends to be beer cans and puke everywhere. If you don't want to be involved in this, you can typically find something fun to do in Boston, or just lay low with your friends and ignore it as much as you can."
College Sophomore,2,The greek life at bentley isn't that popular. There are no sorority houses and the frats are gross and the parties are terrible.
College Freshman,2,"There are not a lot of minorities. While there are international students around, the majority of the campus is whites upper middle class and upper class students."
Freshman,1,I could only stand being here for half a year. It's clear when you step on campus that administration doesn't care about their students. They don't prepare you for the real world with their classes. The housing situation is awful (bugs and mice in the walls). The food (Sudexo) is worse than prison food. There were multiple occasions of finding rats in the salad bar and there was a whole colony of rats living in the dining area. I would not waste your money here.
Freshman,1,"I am a female 18 years old international student who got accepted to Bentley for Fall 2019
1 Academic advisors are always absent
2 tutors are unwilling to help
3 The campus is beautiful but boring except if you like drugs & alcohol 
4 The food is dangerous and unhealthy. 
5 As a female student in a campus of more than 50% male population I was  agressively  approached 
6 Being homesick on the first month I visited the center of psychological support. 
 I was transferred to psychiatric clinic because the school  personnel was absent at the moment.
I have never ever been diagnosed with any mental disorder maybe the Bentley nurse should !
7  In December 2019 a senior student and chief of Lacrosse team was found dead 
Conclusion: I transfered elsewhere by the end of the semester .
just a BIG NO
Avoid"
Freshman,1,"This was such a bad decision! There is a very unsaid culture here that is so toxic. Living with reslife is the absolute worst part. Administrators are all on a power trip. GBs, which are core classes DO NOT TRANSFER TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS. If you are on edge about this school make sure you know that! It is so boring on weekends, you legit have to pray for a party. If you're a rich white kid you'll have a great time though."
Niche User,1,"This school is extremely racist. From administration to students, students of color are targeted on the larger scheme. The administration will have it out for you, even if you have never been written up. Many students of color DO NOT feel safe attending this college. There is almost no diversity and the administration and professors will target those who are not Caucasian. Also it is too far away from Boston and the food sucks you will starve."
Freshman,1,"It is like going to high school all over again. The students are driven, but usually focus on resume patting."
Sophomore,1,"Summary: Rich people wanting to get rich
Self interested, apathetic, and lack of interest in the arts.

The professors are great though, they really do care about your success."
College Senior,1,"The food is inedible. Seasons is basically one huge health violation. My friend once found a dead bug and a ball of hair in her salad. I once got a stomach bug from the dining hall and I never went back after that. La Cava food is decent, but INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED. Einstein's is great, but you can only eat so many bagels before you get sick of them too."
College Sophomore,1,"Not many people live off campus, living in a suburb of Boston is very expensive.  Also great housing options of apartments and suites on campus most students live on campus"
College Sophomore,1,"The infamous Seasons dining hall not only lacks quality food on a daily basis, it also has the most predictable variety of foods every day. It essentially has the same subpar salads, pasta, and pizza everyday, and you will know exactly what foods Seasons has on any given day before you walk in."
College Freshman,1,"The guys here are misogynisitc, anti-semitic ass****s. They only wear vineyard vines, sperry's and pressed kakis. Obsessed with their appearance, not very bright and their only aspirations are to be richer than they already are."
College Freshman,1,"Freshman dorms are decent, Trees is terrible but Slade is very nice. Upperclassman housing is much nicer, but there is virtually no off campus housing available."
College Freshman,1,Very limited offerings at Bentley. Primarily focused on Finance and Accounting. 
College Freshman,1,"The campus is beautiful, but it is all very new. There are no old buildings like a traditional college. There is a nice selection of green spaces such as the lower green space (party central) and the quad. The Dana Athletic Center is lovely, as is the library (although small). The campus traditions include the lower green space party where everyone gets plastered and throws beer bottles at cops. There are very limited campus activities that don't involve drinking or frat houses. There are no arts here. None."
College Freshman,1,"Waltham is a crappy little town that is not even accessible to Bentley students, unless you want to brave the walk and risk getting mugged. You are stuck with on-campus dining. "
College Freshman,1,"If I could give this section a negative star I would. There is NO social diversity, ethnic diversity or religious diversity. The student body is composed of anti-semitic, white, catholic republicans who will not stand for anyone being different. If you deviate from the ""herd"" in any way, whether that be sexual orientation, religious beliefs or political views, you will be treated like a pariah. If you are looking for social diversity, or really any kind of diversity, DO NOT come here. Your individuality will be oppressed. End of story."
College Freshman,1,the weather is sporadic and unpredictable. There is no such thing as fall here. 
College Junior,1,"I transferred into Bentley after my freshman year and received a few thousand a year for financial aid. This is laughable considering my family is far from upper class. On the other hand, you have very wealthy students paying next to nothing to attend the university. The financial aid office is no help when explaining these discrepancies. Also, transfers cannot receive any merit based aid throughout their time at the university. Basically to sum it all up, don't transfer into Bentley if you're not looking to spend a pretty penny on your education."
College Sophomore,1,Too many guys and the girls here are very self entitled because they make up a small percentage of the school
Recent Alumnus,1,"Ashamed alumni – The only reason the school didn't get a F is because the landscaping was above average. I knew MUCH more about business when I was in high school and my own father was hessiatant to hire me because he felt my college education was subpar. Most places I interview have never heard of Bentley or confuse it with Berklee... I don't play the trumpet, sorry 'bout it. The food was intolerable and the staff (except for one lady in la cava) were rude and seemed to resent the students. I made a great effort to be interested/involved in the Bentley life but then decided I'd rather die. Thanks for lowering my IQ, self esteem and chance of future success. "
College Sophomore,1,"Good God – Prepare to be cited and penalized heavily for throwing up in your own bathroom. Don't even THINK about carrying a backpack onto the Greenspace on a beautiful, sunny day. You will automatically be pegged a criminal and can say goodbye to any waterbottle or closed container you may be carrying as we confiscate it (and take down your name). And God forbid you burn your popcorn. That will be $50, don't let it happen again or we will gladly take away your housing credits. Thanks for giving us something to do! 
Remember, we're watching you,
The Bentley Police

P.S: No worries, there's one day a year where we could care less what you do because, quite frankly, we're just outnumbered. It's called Spring Day, and that is your gift from all of us. Enjoy it while you can."

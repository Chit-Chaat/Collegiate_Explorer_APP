Sophomore,5,"The community is so close here. The teachers all give such personal and individualized instruction to help EVERY student succeed. The students here are excellent and encouraging growth and great at positive and constructive criticism. I've been learning so much about myself and the way I create through this school. I highly recommend NHIA to ANY artist, especially if you're nervous about art school or your own art!"
Sophomore,5,"As a second semester sophomore the school is really good at starting your major right off the bat. Being able to get connections with your teachers to help you be the best that you can be and to also to improve your work as much as possible. Freshmen also get the chance to try different types of majors to build up your skills to put under your belt. The students around are friendly and open, it's a great atmosphere and lots of different events that the RAs created to help de-stress and allow students to have fun. The commuters get emails about the events and also dances too! This is a safe campus that doesn't have any of the typical college parties on campus so then you can feel safe while being in the dorms. This is a really good school thatâ€™ll help you be the best artist that you can be."
Niche User,5,An intimate group of hard working people. Still have a letter press. Strong Printmaking facilities. The art mecca of Manchester. A great place to find focus in your work. Interested in helping you with your career as well as your craft. Also a stellar writing department.
Niche User,5,It was a great experience. I loved the classes and people I met. I learned a lot both in class and about the college experience. Really nice college and classes.
Senior,5,"I love it here. The people and teachers are wonderful and it's a really personalized, small environment."
College Sophomore,5,"amazing parties, amazing vibes. Friday and Saturday nights theres never not something going on, just be respectful of your friends apartments and don't walk alone. Bars and clubs are kind of raunchy though."
College Sophomore,5,super amazing. like i said. everyone supports each other. parties are known about and people get drunk. campus security knows and keeps us safe. we aren't allowed to drink on campus but we can come home safe and have a place to sleep without consequence as long as we behave. it's a good system. i never feel like I'm in danger
College Sophomore,5,"everyone is the same. even social classes don't exist. it's a small school, you're friends with everyone."
College Sophomore,5,I have a really great job from the school. it's getting me started in my career field before i've even graduated.
College Sophomore,5,I really enjoy going to school at NHIA. I've met some of the best people and continue to learn everyday. I can't wait to go back in august. The teachers are amazing and do their best to help you. Theyre in the process of changing the curriculum but it's going to improve everything even more.
College Freshman,5,"The campus is in a location of a better area of Manchester, minus the senior dorms on Merrimack Street. Its located in the downtown area of Manchester and it's not a scary area of Manchester."
College Freshman,5,You get to grow relationships with you class easier this way. Everyone is nice here and we all have similar tastes.
College Freshman,5,"I have yet to attend the school, but at all the events I have attended, everyone is so noice and understanding. When I send out an email to anyone in the staff, they're always so helpful and answer right away. Often when they're asked a question, they will send you a solution along with the answer."
College Freshman,5,You can be almost anything. Political views are really the only problem with getting acceptance
College Freshman,5,The professors here really care about the students and work with them to improve the most they can. Administration does all the can to set students up for success and the world after school.
College Freshman,5,No problems have arose since my time at this school.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love my school everything about it is perfect except for attendance policies but only because my anxiety is so bad
College Freshman,5,"Everything is close by, it's a friendly city and there is alway something to do."
College Freshman,5,"My school is only art oriented, I love it."
College Freshman,5,"I love the challenge provided by the proffesors.The home work is a large load, taking up a large portion of my free time. But it's worth it."
Freshman,4,"The professors are well rounded and passionate about what they do. They really want to learn from you and allow you to learn as well. Though, the organization of the school and student services aspect could use some work. All the faculty have different answers to the same question and do not know exactly what is going on, though that could be because of the merger with New England College."
Sophomore,4,"The school in itself is one of the best environments to start your journey as an artist. From the friendly yet eager staff to the lessons taught at the school, you will be finding yourself immersed in the arts in a way you will not believe."
Junior,4,"I am having a good experience at NHIA. Professors I've had are helpful and friendly. I am a commuter, so I don't live in a dorm or eat at the campus cafeteria. There could be an improvement in transportation and have more than one shuttle for students that especially live on campus."
Freshman,4,"I am a first year student and I have enjoyed everything so far. The workload can be a little rough the first few weeks of the semester but, it gets better and the teachers are amazing."
Freshman,4,"I like the small school setting. All the teachers are really invested and it seems like they really care about what you're doing, what you should be doing and the helping you get the skills to get you where you want to be."
Freshman,4,"This school has a very dedicated and hardworking faculty of professors/educators that strive to ensure the success of their students. They're one of the best aspects of this school. However, the staff and administration are almost impossible to communicate with and seem to not want to talk or invest any time into the students. I'd say this is probably the only fault I can find with the school. The campus is small and very easy to navigate, and the class sizes are very nice and manageable. If you're looking for a school with teachers who honestly do care about your future as an artist, this is it. Eventually you'll learn how to handle the staff and administration."
Sophomore,4,"The Institute is a safe environment in a not so safe city They provide everything possible to assure the Students are safe and happy within the problem city of Manchester The food is not on par with the usual I would receive at home, but that is something that is for the actually food company to fix and not the School The dorms and the upkeep of them area always nice and clean  well monitored and a safe space for all it's students equipped with studios to help the artists at work"
College Sophomore,4,"Challenging, and i learn so much. I love what im doing here and I feel like i'm improving everyday"
College Sophomore,4,I love it a lot. they're adding some new options this year. I wish they had AC in all the dorms though. Manchester can get hot during the summer and spring months.
College Junior,4,"Good teachers and interesting courses, however i dont always feel challenged in my class work"
College Junior,4,"Were in a city, so there are some obvious risks to walking alone at night, however on campus life is incredibly safe"
College Freshman,4,Dry campus so it all happens at apartments but there is not a lot of pressure to be into that life.
College Freshman,4,Teachers are super helpful and give lots of work but also understand that not everyone works at the same pace and that there is other projects to work on.
College Freshman,4,Big focus on career gains
College Freshman,4,"I am a second semester freshman at The New Hampshire Institute of Art. I was warned at orientation that the workload is heavy and a lot of students do not come back the following year due to the intensive workload. I personally have found extreme improvements in my finished pieces, work ethic, time management skills, and I am better at taking on tasks I know I can handle. Although, as a freshman I have to take foundation classes, I have looked at classes available and there is such large variety. Even though I am a Fine Arts major, I can take other classes such as calligraphy, which is mandatory for Graphic Design majors and vise versa.  I love all the instructors also. You connect to each of them quickly with small classroom numbers. You are treated an equal by calling instructors by their first name. I feel very comfortable to ask questions and get hands on help, while still receiving mutual respect for one another. I personally have seen such a big improvement in my art, that I am thinking about selling pieces which is a huge confident booster that I did not have prior to coming here. Everyone is very kind and even other students are people who would do anything to help out one another. Even though I am a freshman, coming to an end of my first year at The New Hampshire Institute of Art has been such an amazing experience in a great learning environment and I enjoy being a part of such an amazing group of aspiring artists and community."
College Freshman,4,I've thoroughly enjoyed my experience here thus far.
College Freshman,4,They do a great job in assisting students with whatever needs may arise.
College Freshman,4,The school is great and all of my classes are very fun and insightful. The students are all really supportive and it's a great atmosphere to build your artistic vision in. The only problems i face are paying my tuition bills.
College Freshman,4,All the teachers are really friendly and are open to giving advice not only to help you in class but in a career setting also.
College Freshman,4,The scholarships I received were based on high school GPA and portfolio reviews.
College Freshman,4,Nice variety and it's good.
College Freshman,4,I'm still on campus but will be moving off next simester.
College Freshman,4,Drugs and alcohol don't appear to be a problem in my dorm at all. The schools has rules about it and they watch it carefully.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of close by options at many of the hours of the day. Pricing is about average and discounts aren't readily available but food is good.
College Freshman,4,It seems to be very safe on campus. Doors and entrances are locked. There is potential between buildings on the street but they seem still to be safer than other cities.
College Freshman,4,I had easily recived a continuing merit scholarship for my portfolio.
College Freshman,4,"Even though all classes aren't very close, they are reasonably close. The walk is stimulating in a very nice city. This allows for coffee and snack runs between classes and helps me attentive. Also a shuttle is available when necessary.

Food is very good and nicely deverse.

The double room I'm in is too small for 2. The communal bathrooms are clean and brightly light. I feel like the halls and my neighbors are safe and security overall is good."
College Junior,4,Lots of options in Manchester!
College Senior,4,I had a good experience with financial aid. If you have problems they are generally able to help you solve them.
College Sophomore,4,"The school isn't in the best neighborhood, but I rarely feel unsafe while walking between buildings."
College Sophomore,4,"I commute to school everyday, while living with my parents at home. Parking is free with a sticker, which is great! I just wish there would be more available parking."
College Junior,4,"I like my department a lot. The biggest thing is the community of peers and professors. In order to grow, you need to be challenged and they definitely challenge me to work harder and harder!"
College Junior,4,"It's great, but only after you've gone through the first two years. The really exciting work happens in your junior year - you have more freedom and access to some really fantastic faculty on campus. Workload is pretty high. Lots of job opportunities on campus with the gallery, tutoring, cafeteria, and events. You have to network in order to get internships and job opportunities off-campus, but there are still there. Some students work at the nearby Currier Gallery."
College Junior,4,Campus housing is pretty good. I haven't had too many bad experiences. Most people are respectful and the RD's aren't that strict. Social atmosphere depends on the dorms - some are completely quiet while others have a more involved community.
College Junior,4,"There are so many great restaurants downtown and totally within walking distance! They offer a range of foods at various price-points. Lots of pizza places and a few really nice restaurants. Some really great options for vegetarians, too."
College Junior,4,"Students celebrate their individuality with clothing/fashion. Lots of students play video games and like to watch movies in their spare time. Large LGBT community on campus. Some people go clubbing on weekends, others go to the mall, throw parties at their apartments, or stay in with friends."
College Junior,4,"Although there are some aspects of the school that are less than desirable, I've had a pretty good education for the price. Students must be self-motivated - if you lack passion for the arts, you will not do well here, or at any other art school for that matter. But because this is such a small and intimate school, you must work hard to earn respect or your professors and peers. Everyone knows each other here. There are some clicks, but in general everyone is nice. Not great security - keep your valuables with you at all times! Take advantage of their workshops and guest speakers! School is in expanding right now - developing more majors like graphic design and creative writing. Strong majors are photo, painting, and printmaking."
College Junior,4,Campus has multiple labs and also supplies you with a free lap top after completion of your freshman year.
College Sophomore,4,"The parking around campus is very good. You have a lot of options from the street, to a lot to a garage. All near your classes."
College Sophomore,4,The weather is the typical new england weather of the 4 seasons. Your attire changes monthly.
College Senior,4,"The classes here are really what you make of them. The instructors are incredible and very knowledgable in their respective fields. Unfortunately, there is this air of anti-intellectualism amongst a large population of the student body, but the professors here will help you learn anything you want to if you possess the drive and the desire."
College Senior,4,"The school is completely Mac'd out, and they have a macbook program, where all BFA students eventually get their own MacBook Pro with a full adobe suite. There are large epson printers for archival printing that can print on virtually anything flat, and a few film scanners, though the ones for underclassmen are kind of scratched up."
College Junior,4,"Macs are used in the library, and we have 5+ Mac labs throughout campus. The tech department is helpful in every way possible. Macbook Pro lap tops are provided to every sophomore, and they may keep it as their own personal computer after they graduate from NHIA"
College Sophomore,4,"Good transportation available, but it's near everything that you need, so you could walk or ride a bike."
College Sophomore,4,The financial aid office was extremely helpful to me.
College Junior,4,"The restaurants around Manchester are pretty good. The ones on Elm Street are easy to access on food and are good places to meet friends during breaks. Costs vary and sadly most do not offer a student discount. Choices vary as well, which is nice. I highly recommend The Gyro Spot for any Greek food and Baked for sandwiches, pastry and coffee needs. There is also a locally grown restaurant that serves amazing hummus call Republic. If you can get to South Willow street that are tons of places to eat including any variety of fast food."
College Junior,4,"Registration used to be hell on earth but it's gotten better. It can still be very stressful when you do not get the courses you need but the registrar and advisors will do the best they can to help you. Many of the professors are working artists and are only available on campus for a few hours of a day. This makes meetings extremely difficult and you have to depend heavily on email. Workload is moderate, it all depends on how you layout your course in a semester (it's mostly just time management). Some classes can be extremely rigorous."
College Freshman,4,"So long as you keep things out of sight, RAs won't care. if you act stupid, you can expect to be caught but if you just think things through and put your alcohol in another container then you're pretty much set."
College Sophomore,4,The shuttle is available every day after 7. On the weekends it takes us to the mall and back. For the election yesterday we had a shuttle take us to the polls
College Sophomore,4,Most of the building are repurposed for classes making high victorian ceilings and marble tiles a staple in the majority of building. Amherst street building has a nice gallery and school store with cheap prices for art supplies.
College Senior,4,"Lots to Do â€“ Lots to do on campus and off since we're in the city. YMCA right across the street, lots of cafes, etc."
College Senior,4,"I Guess It Went Well â€“ I had to do it last minute because I transferred, but it was fine."
College Senior,4,Right in the Center of Everything â€“ Right in the city - great for near by jobs without needing a car. Lots of transportation options. Large dining hall and tons of food options.
College Freshman,4,"An interesting and diverse group of students.  There is a feeling of welcome and non-judgment, so you can feel free to be yourself.  The shared interests in art brings people together."
College Freshman,4,"Art School Is Fun â€“ Such an interesting, smart, and diverse group of students and teachers.  People with many different interests to befriend, talk to, and learn from.  New Hampshire (and New England in general) has a great art scene and many galleries and museums, so always interesting events to seek out and look into.  Great place to be if you're an artist."
College Junior,4,"Olive Garden â€“ Olive Garden has fresh, delicious Italian food, with variety of wine and beverages. I love to go there on the weekends to relax and have a cup of wine with my favorite Mediterranean thin crust pizza. Prices are reasonable for students; they give you discounts on their special food menus when ordering food in groups of 5."
College Freshman,4,"There are rare partyes at NH Art. Just hang out with friends week ends yes, but not much big. There are few clubs in the area. But students put more time into studying and a lot of efford in work, then party."
College Freshman,4,The studios at NH Art are great. Enough space for everyone.
College Senior,4,"Get a Car â€“ because it's an urban setting you can either drive, bike, or walk anywhere you want to go. If you feel like traveling out of town, busses are fairly hard to come by, so i suggest bringing a car with you. one great thing about NHIA is night transportation. the area can become kind of sketchy after hours, so the college set up a shuttle system for students who stay after class to work on projects. That way we don't have to walk back to our dorms at night."
College Senior,4,"While we do have a fantastic array of computers and printers in the Graphic Arts lab, the equipment in the library is lack-luster. The connection is just fine, but often times you have to get there early to find an unoccupied computer. Most students there bring their own laptops, and the buildings get fairly good WiFi. They're nice to have due to convenience, but honestly i don't believe they're essential to a better education."
Freshman,2,"New Hampshire Institute of Art is a college run by toddlers with communication issues. My registration was held because my parent didn't fill out a promissory note and I was not notified that there was such a thing that needed to be done. This is not the only issue, I have had friends who the finance office told they had lost their money. I had one friend who got a $2,000 scholarship and instead of taking that out of her tuition, they charged her that much extra. The foundations department is a joke, nobody knows what they are doing and none of them care to even ask."
Niche User,2,"Iâ€™m attending New Hampshire Institute of Art with  concerns for this school. I didnâ€™t give it 2 stars because of the  faculty- because thereâ€™s a large a amount of them who do truly care. As a current student  I can not say all of them care but I canâ€™t say all of them donâ€™t  because I havenâ€™t had many of the teachers yet. I can tell you how my experience has been so far and the rough patches in it. For starters NHIA promotes itself as diverse- itâ€™s not. Manchester , yes , is a city with a growing population and cultures. But if you come from a large city or states like Miami, Baltimore, Cali, Chicago , or New York ; Manchester is the no diverse as all. If you are not white I promise you will feel like a fish out of water for awhile. Donâ€™t let that scare you for coming but since the school doesnâ€™t warn you I feel like someone has to."
Senior,2,"It kind of feels like an art school for people that aren't genuinely interested in avant-garde or boundary pushing art - like a lot of the final projects I see being made by peers and alumni feels pretty kitsch. That's not really what I wanted, I wanted to be tested, challenged, and learn more about my strengths and weaknesses to craft better work. Critiques are pretty mixed here, and most of the time the challenges are just over saturation of homework and dealing with pointless projects that don't seem to be getting anywhere. Also the school is losing money so that's a plus...losing resources yet having to charge us more and more each year is quite lovely. WE NEED MORE GALLERY SPACES TOO. I could say a lot more but it'd be a freaking novella. Personally, I'm trying to make the most of my last year here, I would recommend going somewhere else closeby, there's a few good ones I here in Massachusetts."
Alum,2,"The professors will bend over backwards to help the students. They alone are the reason to go here since your art will explode in growth. The rest needs work. The dorms are pretty abysmal, I even had a RD harass me and go into my room without a warrant. The school would like to think that they are accepting and hip, the reality is that most students hate each other and have prejudices of each other. However there are exceptions, and there are lots of kind people at this school. I sadly also had a bully during my time at NHIA, and I couldn't simply beat him up, I had to take it to the school and the school did absolutely nothing. There is no party scene really, there are no athletics, and the dining hall is almost a war crime. The vibe of Manchester, to me, is very unwelcoming. Everyone looks at each other as if they have five heads on them. Also sadly the price just keeps going up and up with less help every year."
College Junior,2,"Don't go here. While the faculty is great, the administration is a nightmare to deal with. I'm graduating next semester and have been dealing with my tuition bill constantly getting screwed up, passive aggressive administration, and absolutely no respect or concern for commuters. This school doesn't have its stuff together. Go elsewhere."
College Junior,2,I haven't been very impressed with the institute. Especially this year.
College Junior,2,Heroin is a problem. As well as the homeless.
College Junior,2,I think the attendance policy is too strict.
College Junior,2,A lot of students complain of getting sick from the schools food. I choose to not eat there ever. Have done so twice and regretted it. I'd eat high school food any day compared to that.
College Sophomore,2,"No internship yet, but I am sure I will very soon."
College Senior,2,I've read that the dining services typically hired by schools are the same ones typically serving prisons. The cafeteria here does nothing to disprove that.
College Senior,2,"The school has a professional security team that routinely patrols campus, and the shuttle is available to take you to and from buildings if you don't feel comfortable walking alone at night. Though there is crime in the city, if you're smart and alert it shouldn't affect you. The school attempts to make students feel safe and all of the buildings are secured with swipe cards and time locks. Self defense classes are also offered extra-curricularly from time to time."
College Senior,2,"The school does not have enough parking lots to accomodate all commuter students, so often, you'll pay a meter. If you live locally and have a car you can get a monthly parking pass for one of the city's garages for somewhere around $50."
College Sophomore,2,"Manchester is a pretty sketchy place. There are a few places to eat but no really cheap fast food joints unless you have a car. There really is not a whole lot of things to do in town within walking distance, unless your 21 there are a few bars and a sleazy club within walking distance, you walk past it to get to one of the buildings."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a whole lot of Diversity, almost everyone is white. Most people are non religious, but people are not ignorant, there is a very high number of people from the LGBT community. and women largely outnumber the men."
College Freshman,2,Parking usually has it troubles but there seems to be some always available it just might require some more walking and money.
College Freshman,2,There are people of many different races and religions. The majority of students are white. But each student has a unique personality and give it a colorful environment.
College Freshman,2,"I personally don't live in the dorms but people don't like how some dorms don't have windows, and I hear the food is ok."
College Freshman,2,"Food is fairly expensive off campus. Expect to buy a microwave meal at the cvs if you don't have atleast ten dollors. Most of the local restaurants offer discounts to students, but that can still be a steep bill."
College Junior,2,"Manchester is not a safe city at all. The school is in the middle of downtown, however, so it could be worse. Just don't ever walk through the park late at night. In fact, don't walk anywhere late at night. 
Granted, the Institute does provide a shuttle service from academic buildings and dorms, and security guards at every building, but it could be a lot safer."
College Sophomore,1,"we do kickball, like once a year??? none of us really like sports"
College Sophomore,1,"if you're expecting a greek life, you should look elsewhere- although there was a toga party freshman year, that was weird"
College Sophomore,1,"If you go to art school, theres going to be drugs. Weed is a thing everywhere though. However here, LSD, coke, mushrooms drinking, you name it, is popular among students. it's not a bad crowd though. if you don't want to do it, you don't have to."
College Freshman,1,"I do not believe that wwe have any greek life at the institute, we concentrate mostly in art and writing."
College Freshman,1,Your question continue to assume there is a Greek organization. I have little to no exposure to those organizations so I'm indefferant.
College Senior,1,"The school is not very diverse, however there is a very accepting LGBT community."
Recent Alumnus,1,All the buildings are not maintained and are falling apart. They break many state building laws and codes. The school actively pays off officials to keep these buildings open.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Students at this school are terrible to one another. Very natsy and childish. Get used to being in high school all over again. Actively and openly attack other students, and often faculty will join in. Administration does nothing to help students who need it."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Food made students very ill. Left out and or reheated. Moldy and terribly quality. Never open late or on weekends. Freshmen and Sophmores forced to pay and have the meal plan. Dinner area's are not clean or maintained! 

Restaurants around the school are abundant and wonderful. Get used to them because you are going to need them. 

Dorm kitchens are broken and not maintained so you can not make your own food. In the times the kitchens are functional you have to fight with other students to use them. Other students will steal or destroy your food."
College Sophomore,1,"Gross, Theres always tons of old leftovers, they keep it out for days and then they eventually toss it. They have very strict hours, and they close by 7:30 so if your hungry later at night your out of luck. its about $7.50 a meal which is expensive for not vey good food. Even the salads are left out for too long there good at the beginning of the week but don't touch it on Friday. They have less food and different  times that it's open  also the meal times are much shorter and earlier. Oh and you have to be on it unlit your jr. year unless you get a doctors note, which is pathetic."
College Sophomore,1,"Its not very strict , it's a dry campus, and they do room checks. But unless you leave things out in the open you will not get in trouble. You can come into the dorms drunk as long as you don't cause a ruckus and you go into your room. Which is nice so you can go back to your room and have a safe place to sleep. But if you manage to have a loud drunken party in your dorm it's a serious offense, they dump your booze and you get written up."
College Sophomore,1,"As a Woman of average looks in this college it is extremely difficult to find any kind of man to date in the student body.Women outnumber men 3 to 1. and many of the men are Gay, but the few single men have there pick of any of the more attractive girls on campus, so yeah its hard to find a date. There are alot of people who dress in the Hipster fashions, and many who just don't care and wear old dirty clothes, but there are alot of diverse kinds of style and tons of colorful hair. social lives are pretty slow unless you get into the correct group of people, it's hard with the amount of work that we have."
College Sophomore,1,I personally don't use the dining hall but I'm so glad I don't. It's really expensive and you do not get a great variety or food. They open at weird hours and you are not allowed to take food out. So if you have a class while the dining hall is open you are out of luck.
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you get to the school obscenely early or later in the day parking is nearly impossible in the school lots and you will have to pay for parking. Word of advice either take morning classes and stay in your spot or bring a LOT of quarters, you'll need them"
College Sophomore,1,"If you like drugs and feeling unsafe this college is for you. The teaching there is the only reason I might stay there. The classes and the teachers are amazing and I have learned a lot. Its really just the campus life and the ""colleagues"" that are not adequate."
College Sophomore,1,"Almost every student I know does drugs, thats why I don't have friends because I choose not to be friends with a crowd that uses and abuses. Its very common for them to be done across the street, in the common room,  and in the dorm I live in (I'm unable to speak for the other dorms, but considering I know people who live in them, I'm pretty sure they do).
If you want a drug free school, this school is lying to you if they say that they are drug free."
College Sophomore,1,"When it comes to the shuttle really depends on which driver you get, the good one has good driving skills although they are rarely available. The bad one is a crazy student who rarely gets sleep and is very spastic. Overall I would give their driving combined a C. Taxis never seem to change no matter where you are so, in my opinion, its neither good or bad. As for the bus, I usually fear for my safety, there are almost always people on drugs and/or drinking."

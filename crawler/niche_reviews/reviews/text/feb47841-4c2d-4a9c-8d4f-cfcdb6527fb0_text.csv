Junior,5,"If you're looking for a one of a kind college experience that is different from the norm, I would highly recommend Sierra Nevada University. Nestled in Incline Village in the Northern Sierra Nevada's, it offers a plethora of outdoor activities and a vibrant college social life. From paddle boarding on majestic Lake Tahoe to skiing the slopes of Mt. Rose or backpacking the Tahoe Rim Trail, the amount of exploration and opportunities for discovery are seemingly endless. The amount of personal time that the teachers are willing to put into every student is  awesome in every sense of the word. I still talk to and check in with professors that I no longer even have. Not because I have a question that I need answered, but simply because of good rapport. If you're looking for a college that truly cares about the success of their students and takes the time to develop one's passions and skills, then you've come to the right place!"
Junior,5,Beautiful place to study at. The teachers are passionate about what they do and strive to introduce a new way of learning.
Freshman,5,Sierra Nevada College has been amazing with all of my questions and enrollment process. I always look forward to hearing from my instructors or counselors because theyâ€™re always positive and ready to help.
Sophomore,5,"I love the the school is so small and personal. Everyone knows each other, and they are so caring and do their jobs so amazingly. I love the atmosphere and the way the whole campus is set up."
Senior,5,"The location could not get any better. Campus is less than a mile from the beautiful lake shore where the views are always breathtaking. SNC is a small school which is really nice when it comes to creating a personal relationship with your professors, allowing you the maximum help. Although I really enjoy the smallness of the school I would have liked to see more classes offered. The school has a lot of expanding to do with their academics but overall is an excellent place to attend."
Alum,5,"Transferring to Sierra Nevada College was the best decision I've ever made.  The location is one-of-a kind and the education is top-notch.  SNC professors are brilliant and all have professional experience in their field of choice.  Getting internships and job opportunities is extremely easy, especially by networking through the connections the school already has.  Scholarships make this school very affordable.  I cannot recommend Sierra Nevada College enough!"
Senior,5,The class sizes are great. I'm a transfer and at my previous school I felt like I wasn't viewed as anything more than my ID number. At SNC the great outdoors is at your fingertips and Tahoe has such a great community with friendly people.
Sophomore,5,"Right in the mountains, less than a 2 minute drive from the nearest ski resort and over 6 resorts less than an hour away! Professors have loads of real world experience so my education feels very applicable to a future career. Small classes (10-20 students) make it easy to connect with professors to get the most out of course material. Plus, Lake Tahoe is less than a 5 minute walk away...you can't really beat that!"
Sophomore,5,Sierra Nevada College completely changed my life. It gave me the opportunity to ski as well as double major within business. I never thought I'd be able to live in a place like this and do what I love the most!
College Freshman,5,I love the athletics department in the sense that they advertise well for games/ meets. Also joining a team is easy because sign ups are all over the place.
College Junior,5,I've enjoyed all the professors that I've had and they all want to be apart of their student's success.
College Junior,5,The faculty is very helpful if a student wants to find a job or internship. I haven't heard any complaints.
College Junior,5,"The gym isn't on campus for athletes to work out at, but the gym we do go to is of very high quality. A lot of students here are athletes, so it's a fun environment. Everyone likes to be involved in something."
College Junior,5,I think this is a great college! It's small enough to where students can get help from their actual teachers. The faculty is very involved in student success.
College Junior,5,"The small environment and class sizes make it easy to learn on your own terms. The Student Government Association does a great job of hosting events that are fun and a good way to meet people. Finally, the college is within 2 hours or less of a dozen ski areas, which is so great. Also, Tahoe. No more needs to be said."
College Sophomore,5,"SUNSHINE AND SNOW 
BEACH AND MOUNTAINS "
College Sophomore,5,"Nature has to be your thing to live in Incline but Tahoe is amazing! 
Most of the locals here are rich and have more than one home so they don't really have an opinion on the college students. There isn't a whole lot going on in Incline but Reno and South Lake are right down the road and have a lot going on. "
College Sophomore,5,"The facilities are great. Dorms have heated floors and their own bathrooms, the library is designed like a ski lodge, the dining hall is nice and clean and we have a Platinum LEED certified science building. 
The school is in great shape and a super nice atmosphere. "
College Junior,5,"its very strict for a reason, when kids leave there parents for a while they go crazy"
College Junior,5,"Ive never been to a place where finding a teacher and getting to talk to them so easy. Its a very small campus the way i like it. i wouldn't switch schools, this school along with everyone here has helped me out in so many ways."
Junior,4,"Overall, My online experience with Sierra Nevada University has been well. Given the circumstances and available resources, I feel that my professors have done an adequate job of adapting to this abrupt change within my educational institution and have taught/presented the curriculum in a way that is still greatly beneficial to the student."
Junior,4,"Stunning campus. Just beautiful. Amazing school culture, strong student involvement, and overall a very happy place. However, academics could be stronger. A lot of teachers are old, forgetful, and disorganized. This makes learning quite difficult and my grades have sometimes suffered from it. It's too expensive for the quality of education being provided. That being said, I love this school. It's a very unique and special place and I would make the same choice to attend now as I did two years ago."
Junior,4,Sierra Nevada College had the most beautiful campus ever. It's located a half of a mile away from the beautiful Lake Tahoe shore. The surrounding area had tons of back country access and many ski resorts. It's the ultimate ski college.
Junior,4,The professors form relationships with their students. Most teachers are available for help whenever it is needed and help each student thrive. SNC provides a unique experience with its small class sizes and close-knit feel. The sports teams are all like family. I have met some of my best friends here while growing into the person I am today. Sierra Nevada College provides a great education where multiple connections can be made to provide amazing opportunities during and after attending SNC. Budget cuts have hurt different programs and taken away from what it provided in the past.
Junior,4,"SNC has a wonderful location and lovely staff and faculty. They are becoming very business-focused, but the English and other Humanities departments still stand strong."
Alum,4,"My review for SNC is ONLY for the Interdisciplinary Program. I also got a business degree but was extremely disappointed with the teachers and classes in that program. The business program is easy and doesn't require a lot of work/effort; this is why it is the most 'sought out for' degree by SNC students. However, I will always speak highly of the Interdisciplinary program. The teachers are incredible and are there for you on an educational and mental level. You are required to do an internship, community-based project, research project, fundraising event, and numerous research papers to graduate from that program. To most of the SNC population that is a turn-off because it is a lot of work. However, for me, I graduated with a well-seasoned resume and had real-world experience that helped me land jobs even while I was in school and gave me enough confidence to start my own company. I HIGHLY suggest going into the interdisciplinary program."
Sophomore,4,"Great school that is actually IN the mountains. The closest ski resort is two minuets away and the spectacular lake is only a five minute walk! If your looking to go to college, but don't want to give up your outdoor lifestyle, come to SNC. The college is action sport oriented and has a great freestyle and alpine ski team! The professors are hands on and very accredited. The only criticism I have is that the dorm food could be substantially better. Overall, this school is a hidden gem. Would highly recommend."
Freshman,4,Amazing school for skiers/snowboarders. The campus is small but offers one on one education with your professors. The only downside is the  high cost and the school's food.
College Freshman,4,"the campus is beautiful and well-kept. Dorm life is good, their are a multitude of events for students to take part in. The cafeteria is the only part of SNC that is a real issue and causing more stress for students because when the food is so unappealing and monotone that they can't eat it the students must go shopping and spend money on an already tight budget, even though cafeteria food has already been charged to our student account and paid for by the beginning of the semester."
College Freshman,4,"Safety is great, no reason to feel afraid or unsafe. The health is good too, maintenance cleans everyday the common area(s) and classrooms. the health in the cafeteria isn't the best, just speaking on food quality."
College Freshman,4,"Housing isn't too spacious if in a double. Even though I am in a double, all triple furniture is still in my room. The school refuses to remove it. Also no mini fridges or microwaves are available anymore for rent in the semester so they leave the students left to another expensive cost."
College Junior,4,I haven't heard or seen anything bad happen on this campus.
College Junior,4,Small classes and the beautiful environment surround the school is hands down the best things to have when going to college
College Sophomore,4,The school is a fantastic place for a student looking for a very specific education. The professors are exemplary and the classes are great.
College Sophomore,4,"If you are into the small town vibe and knowing everyone on campus then SNC is for you. It is basically a High School with better parties. The Ski and Board Teams are big on campus and people who come not knowing how to ski/board always learn from someone on campus. There is also a club for this. 

Events on campus are rad because student government funds many of them! Casino night is the best and the prizes are always great. Paddle boards, camping gear, gift certificates, season ski passes, ext. 

Classes are pretty easy. Your GPA will stay solid if you show up to class. 

Night life is fun because everyone from campus goes, but it can get old going to the same 3 bars in town week after week. House parties are big, but tend to get shut down in this small town. 

IF YOU SKI THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! no school on a powder day!"
College Junior,4,Great student to teacher ratio. The teachers and support staff were very hands on and invested in the students. There were lots of opportunities for the Freshmen to interact and pick the brains of the upper classes. The Freshmen dorm was a wonderful living environment.
College Sophomore,4,The school thrives on athletics. Skiing is a huge part.
College Sophomore,4,It's a small tourist ski town. Not much to do if you're not into outdoor adventures. The lake is the most beautiful aspect.
College Senior,4,"If you enjoy the outdoors, this is a great place to be. Much of the community engages in running, hiking, rafting, biking, and other winter activities like skiing and snowboarding. Everyone in this town is pretty active, and especially friendly. This town is very safe, limited criminal activity. Shopping is limited but there are 2 grocery stores, and multiple restaurants looking to fit your every food craving."
College Sophomore,4,Four words--own bathroom. Heated Floors. 
College Sophomore,4,"This is a school for certain majors, people who complain should go to a bigger school with more options. We like to joke and call SNC ""a designer education"""
College Sophomore,4,"Small classes-easy office hours-email responses and NO TA's, only professors. "
College Sophomore,4,My first year was AMAZING. I have since taken some time off and come back to a different environment but it still seems to be a good school and the faculty are still amazing. 
College Sophomore,4,You have to have your own computer but for the most part it is super easy to get printers installed and any tech help 
College Junior,4,"Sierra nevada college has the biggest art program, we just got a new building for the whole art/ music program."
College Junior,4,"everything is great, but to see if its good for you... you have to come here"
College Junior,4,food is sometime available and we have a great head chef who cooks amazing food
College Freshman,4,I believe that there are a lot of options to off-campus housing. The problem is that there has to be a group of students that are pretty close to move in with you to share the rent. This is because we live in a high class town and it can be quite expensive.
College Freshman,4,My first semester was very easy compared to my high school experience. I am excited to start my next semester in order to challenge myself more.
College Freshman,4,"The school is very small, so the attitude is very much like high school. "
College Freshman,4,They are strict in all the right ways and topics. 
College Sophomore,4,Great psychology program. Hands on experience
College Sophomore,4,"For me, its one a few options due to finances"
College Sophomore,4,"Great architecture, just not alot of areas"
College Sophomore,4,there are several good psychology internships
College Sophomore,4,"I love psychology, just wish more classes"
College Senior,4,"Many people hang out on campus. There is a large yard for students to hang out outside and play. The library is very accessible for students to study, get tutored, and even just hang out. There are different levels in the library for different needs. There is a recreation center next to the school. Trips and activities are constantly planner for anyone to take part in."
College Senior,4,Sierra Nevada College is a private college and therefore the classes are small which ensures one-on-one learning with the professors. The school has a great science department. The professors seem knowledgeable and are very friendly and willing to help.
College Senior,4,"I wasn't here for my first two years, the most important but coming in as a transfer i think these dorms are awesome. The R.A's aren't up your butt like my other school, busting you for every little thing. They aren't anything special but they're cozy. They help you find new roommates if you don't like the one you had. They work with you to accommodate!"
College Senior,4,"Free printing both color and black & white in the library, as well as computers around all the buildings. The Tech desk is always nice and will help you out with everything that involves printing or computers. If you bring your own laptop, they help you get set up with everything - email, website, printers, etc. There are computers for anyones use available in the library."
College Junior,4,". The program is still fairly new, but so far so good."
College Junior,4,Process was simple and easy. Just depends on what major you choose.
College Senior,4,"As an Accounting Major,but I currently work seasonly at a local lake, where I take care of all of the financial responsiblities for the resort. I have been working for them for the past seven summers and I feel this has been an internship for my major in accounting. With going to school full time in the spring and fall, and working full time during the summer, I have had very little time to do an internship. My responibilities at the lake include cash intake, accounts receivable and accounts payable with financial statements such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows."
College Sophomore,4,"There are way more guys then girls, and i can't say that it bothers me. Everyone gets along so it works."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a A- toward the fact that there are a lot of drugs and alcohol on campus, but the school is really strict on enforcing the rules around campus."
College Junior,4,3 Guys to Every Girl â€“ the male population here at sierra nevada college is higher than the girl population but everyone on campus knows each other and gets along well with each other.
College Junior,4,there hasn't been any bad things happen at sierra nevada college. it is a safe environment and we have security 24/7!
College Junior,4,Always Packed â€“ they have different options for different class-men during their school years but the dorms are mostly freshmen which could get a bit out of control.
College Junior,4,taxis are the best way to get around incline village if you arent just going to walk to your destination as everything is walking distance but taxis are always there when you need them during late nights.
College Junior,4,Excellent Food â€“ Our school's dining hall is amazing they have an open salad bar and they have a person in the back where you can order fresh burgers or sandwiches if you aren't feeling the food of the day. there are always different options for you to chose from.
College Senior,4,"I Love It Here â€“ Grass Valley is a beautiful place to live in with many trees, rivers, and lakes. The instructors are very easy to talk to and you get the benefit of improving your grade with various extra credit assignments. I loved all of my classes!"
College Sophomore,4,"We don't have a baseball/basketball any of that crap. But we have a snowboard team, ski, rock climbing, all the outdoor sports!"
College Sophomore,4,"Teachers Are Awesome â€“ Teachers are down to earth, always there to help when they are free. Even if they are really busy they will make time for you. They know everyone loves the snow, their curriculum/workload/tests work around that. Very flexible!"
College Sophomore,4,"Condos Everywhere! Its a ski town, which means a lot of empty condos rich people rent out. Most of the condos are right next to the college and have 4 bedrooms (mostly). Which makes rent really affordable about $300, if you get roommates."
College Senior,4,"Great Technology, Good Internet â€“ With the majority of students having their own laptops, there is plenty of room to use the on campus PC's located in the library. Internet is highly functional about 90% of the time. However, printers are sometimes a campus wide issue that students must deal with. This is mainly around exam time when the network is overloaded. The Information Technology department is ready and willing to help throughout the school day with any problem or question you may have. From setting up statistics programs to fixing your CD drive, they can do it all."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The drug scene at SNC isn't very big, although it varies from group to group. Many people are really active so they are usually out doing stuff. Some people smoke but theres no pressure to join in."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Hotel-Style Lodge Dormitories That Are Nearly Brand New â€“ The two dorm offerings at SNC are first rate. Each room has it's own personal bathroom, furnishings, and a fridge/microwave combo. Both dorms are less than ten years old and have high quality, lodge style appointments. It's joked that the SNC dorms are more like hotel rooms than dorm rooms."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The Mecca of Outdoor Sports, Local Culture, and Comfortable Vibe â€“ Incline Village can offer SNC students a supportive, fun, laid-back community feel. Despite Incline being a wealthy community, the mixture of offerings for college students and the affluent demograhpic are evenly spaced. The comfortable Tahoe feel is apparent in the atmosphere, and scene in this area of northern California."
College Junior,4,Kick Back â€“ this is a kick back campus. Take your snobby intolerant racist ass somewhere else.
College Junior,4,"Don't Get Caught â€“ its a pretty lay back campus, but if you live in the dorms they are clear about rules. So I say, if you want to break rules do it away. Plenty of kids in apartments and so most goes on away from dorms. No gestapo stuff... but fair warning means only the really dumb ones get caught."
Sophomore,2,"Please read! Only go here if you ski/snowboard avidly and are in love with it, you can easily do that everyday with other kids who love it, and you're going to have a great time. If not, please please do something better: It's expensive, the food is barely edible(seriously, i've gone hungry a lot), many of the courses are such a waste of time you'll wonder how its allowed, the school is so small youâ€™ll know everyone's name the first day, socializing happens once or twice a week, and you're really going to wish you went to a school that challenges and stimulates you. 
If you're not passionate about snow sports, please take advantage of your college years by going to a school that's going to push you, socially and academically so you learn about your field and are set up for success.however  If you are passionate about snow sports, you're going to have the time of your life regardless of how the school is because you'll be busy and theres nothing wrong with that if its your thing."
Freshman,2,"This college was not the best in my opinion. I felt like I didnâ€™t have any growth in my major and no room for growth otherwise. The courses are slim picking and thereâ€™s only a few good professors. The housing staff is not very best and itâ€™s hard to reach people in case of an emergency. The dorms are falling apart I guess that can be expected. 

Itâ€™s extremely expensive and in my opinion not worth it. 

If your coming here just to party and live in Tahoe youâ€™ve come to the right place. Thereâ€™s lots to do if your athletic like rock climbing, skiing, hiking ect. But if your not into stuff like that it can get pretty boring."
Niche User,2,"The Area around SNC is something you won't find anywhere else. With a ridiculous amount of world class ski resorts right next door and a plethora of hiking, and other mountain related activities, you really have the might of the mountains at your fingertips. Unfortunately the college itself falls quite short. The Academics are weak, I played computer games during every class and i got a 3.6 with less homework than i had senior year of high school. The Dorms are great, every room has a private bathroom, but i hope you like the smell of marijuana. Social life is minimal as within two weeks you will already know everyone who goes to SNC due to how small it is. Make the grocery store Raley's your home as the Cafeteria food will most likely leave you being unable to contain your farts for a week.  All the drawbacks of a small college with none of the benefits, and a big 0l' $48,000 price."
Junior,2,"SNC is extremely small and everyone knows everyone. Academics are hit or miss. I have taken classes here where the professors don't seem to know the material themselves and I've taken great classes here with professors who have legitimate real world experience. Location is great, social life is extremely lackluster. Most kids seem very unmotivated/don't care about their education. If all you really want to do is ski 100+ days a year this school is for you."
College Freshman,2,"SNC has one expensive meal plan, for horrible food. The dorms are expensive for the quality. But the classes have been great and most of my professors are passionate and want to help the students do their best. if the cafeteria would completely change the menu and make healthy, hearty and a variety of meals SNC would be so much better."
College Senior,2,"Besides TART, which is not always the best option. There really is no other option for public transportation."
College Sophomore,2,"Small school--small selection. 
Sodexo sucks but hey! salad bar!"
College Junior,2,"Is diversity Europeans and white Americas? then yes this school is, but if no then no the diversity here is very poor."
College Freshman,2,"There is buses, but the buses are not used at all. The main part of town is a 20-30 min walk away from campus. I would say a car would be very much needed."
College Sophomore,2,Not a huge variety but small class sizes
College Sophomore,2,"No offcampus dining, just some fast food joints "
College Sophomore,2,"Same food every day, poorly made"
College Sophomore,2,Our health care is a joke
College Senior,2,"Sierra Nevada College is located in Incline Village, Nevada. This is a very small town. There are no clubs and not many places to go out to. Night life mostly consists of finding somewhere to get together with friends."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking situation kind of sucks, there is limited parking for students who don't want to pay the permit costs. The permit cost is stupidly high, 100$ a semester. Ticketing and fines are stupid, although your car is safe, they get you hard if you are parked in there, they will have your car ticketed and booted in no time."
College Senior,2,Computer Usage â€“ Computers are available for uses but there is not many of them. The only student computers that are available are the few that are in the library and the tutor center. This is why the school requires you to own your own laptop.
College Student,2,"Prim Library is pretty new place on Sierra Nevada College but limit time hours, limit college computers, and small gallery. There are activities but depend on times and day available. Dining Cafe is pretty limit on foods and time hours like Monday through Friday at 7:30am to 7pm and Saturday-Sunday at 10am to 7pm. Some students don't clean up after themselves like dump the dishes on floor or dorm which they don't give back. I notices some students does have disrespect on foods, dishes, and clean thing."
College Freshman,2,"Close Eye â€“ Getting caught is pretty serious and easy to do at such a small school. Parties are always off campus and security does a good job patroling. It can be a pain when I want to have a good time, but when I need to work, I always have a good environment to do so."
Alum,1,"Please educate yourself before attending this university. It takes a certain person to love this school enough to stay there for four years. I transferred from this school after two years and believe it was the best decision I ever made. Unless if you are a ski-bum/stoner, you will wonâ€™t feel like you belong. Literally all people do at this school is ski and smoke weed/do heavy drugs. Itâ€™s a very small school to the point where you know everyone as if they were siblings. The food is awful, the courses are all very poorly taught, with the exception of a few professors. If you are huge on the outdoors and a hippy lifestyle this might not be a bad place for you. All that said, deciding on a college is a big step in life that will ultimately shape who you are as an adult. Attending SNU is not for everyone, I know people who loved it and those who absolutely hated it."
Alum,1,The school is poorly managed. Nobody knows what they are doing . Lack of diversity and mistreatment  towards  diverse students there. Students there have a cult like mentality. Honestly a waste of money and just not worth it . Please avoid the school at all cost.
Niche User,1,"Sierra Nevada College is one of the most corrupt and mismanaged institutions in the entire country. Especially when it comes to how they treat their Faculty/Staff and student athletes in particular. Leadership consistently invests in short term solutions and would rather spend less money to bring in unqualified individuals than invest in the capable, professional, caring, and incredibly qualified individuals they already have on staff. Unfortunately, it is these professionals and the students that pay the price. 

THEY SELL INCOMING STUDENTS ON THE POTENTIAL OF WHAT THE SCHOOL COULD BE IN THE FUTURE...NOT WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW.

Student athletes are not taken care of or looked out for. The retention rate is almost 3x less than the national average because the school tells the families what they want to hear to get the students to attend, then they are not able to fulfill their promises. STAY FAR AWAY AND EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS."
College Sophomore,1,Only about 2 bars. underaged kids. not fun
College Senior,1,"Parking passes are required ($60/semester), but there aren't anywhere near enough parking spaces for students and staff.  Many people buy a parking pass and still can't park on or near campus due to a simple lack of space."
College Freshman,1,"It's pretty much a all white school if you look Diversity your not going find it, Pretty much girls that live on campus been around block with guys or they have no personality at all. If your non-white female or male be prepared for the classic line "" I'm sorry but i'm not into (insert race here)"". The RA's are into themselves to actually help students in dorm life. Education sucks, barely any courses. This school is a waste of money and it's a sham that such a ugly place is build into this area"
College Sophomore,1,"Sierra doesn't have off campus housing. Its mostly like your own thing, they have roommate postings on the bulletin board but other than that you're on your own"
College Sophomore,1,"Cars Are Best â€“ this campus is isolated to what college kids need, and that's a good thing because the campus is small enough for the students to walk to class. But when it comes to off campus activities, such as shopping for food clothes...etc# you would have to have a car to get around."

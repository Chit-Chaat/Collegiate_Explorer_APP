Alum,5,Took some MBA courses online. It was a fairly standard experience. I would always recommend in person classes if you can manage to.
Alum,5,Amazing school with amazing people. The professors truly care about your education and preparing you for the real world. Your classmates are some of the most down to Earth and caring people you'll ever meet as well. This school is one of those best kept secrets.
Junior,5,"The campus is well-kept and is very beautiful. I love that even though it is a small university, it feels larger to me. I love the size of the classrooms, and I love all of the activities and programs on the campus."
Alum,5,"Waynesburg University has a great nursing program, one of the best in the state with a high NCLEX pass rate. I enjoyed the campus and student life while attending. I had some of my best memories at Waynesburg."
Freshman,5,I will be a freshman at this school this upcoming 2020 fall. The application process was super easy and simple. They kept reaching out to me by phone call and email to answer any questions I had. They did their best to make my decision easier and help lead me to the right direction. I immediately fell in love with the campus during a visit. The atmosphere is amazing down there. Everyone is so friendly. They have an amazing criminal justice program and the softball coaches and players are super friendly and helpful as well.
Freshman,5,"Waynesburg is a wonderful university. However, I would like the area surrounding it become more developed. There is not a lot to do. Besides that, the school is amazing."
Freshman,5,"I love the Waynesburg campus. It's beautiful and wonderfully placed. All the teachers seem to be great people and sports look to be fun. If the football recruiters had not called me, I wouldn't even know the college existed. fast forward three months, and now I'm enrolled, moving into my dorm in seven days."
Senior,5,"Waynesburg University is a very cozy, private school, with great professors, great clubs and groups, and a beautiful campus."
Junior,5,"Waynesburg University has a beautiful campus with outstanding academic ratings. I chose WU because of the nursing program, as it is rated as No. 2 in PA.  Once out of the Freshman dorms, the dorms are great. The people overall at Waynesburg are really nice and willing to help in any way. There are lots of opportunities to join clubs/athletics. I love that the classroom size is small because the professors have more time to focus on the students."
Freshman,5,The students are friendly and the teaches and staff are helpfully.  They have an awesome forensic science program
Freshman,5,"Waynesburg is very easy to talk to, and they reach out to make sure that everything is going well. It is a smaller school which makes it easier to talk one on one with your professors and just make your life easier overall."
Sophomore,5,The faculty and staff at Waynesburg University care about the students and show great passion. The environment is inviting. Waynesburg University is a great campus to consider.
Niche User,5,"Such an amazing experience! Not only is the community great but so are the people.... and the food! I went to Waynesburg recently and I felt at home there, if you like smaller colleges I would recommend this one by far!"
Alum,5,I graduated from Waynesburg University in 2015 with a BS in Nursing. The School was excellent and I could not give a more positive review. The other students seemed to be of a much higher caliber compared to previously attended schools. The faculty exemplified what a college professor should be. I loved the small school design as it gave a welcoming atmosphere and the christian values seemed to be portrayed throughout the campus. I cannot speak for other majors but after graduating from this university I felt extremely well prepared to be do my job.
Niche User,5,Waynesburg University is a fantastic school to attend. The campus is beautiful and the community is outstanding. The campus is very safe with several majors to choose from. There are several different dorm options and meal plans as well. I definitely fell in love with this campus and I strongly think you should look into this school.
Niche User,5,I loved the staff and students there.  Had some circumstances not come up (non-school related) I would have definitely stayed and continued my education at Waynesburg.  It felt like a second home to me.
Junior,5,"Waynesburg is a small, friendly, happy campus. From the first day I visited I felt at home. Most of the campus knows each other and are friends with each other, it is truly a family on this campus!"
Junior,5,"Waynesburg is a small, private, Christian University, and it has such a great atmosphere. Everyone is so pleasant and friendly, and they are always welcoming. I have loved every second of being here since I first stepped foot on campus 4 years ago on a tour. It is reasonably priced, and the academic programs are outstanding. Really, you can’t beat Waynesburg University. I could not have picked a better school."
Junior,5,"The second you walk onto campus, you feel welcomed and at home. People greet you as you walk by, hold open doors, or just give you a smile. The small campus allows people to build lifelong relationships with one another. I love that Waynesburg is so focused on giving back to the local community and international community through volunteer opportunities and service trips. It's a truly unique place that is continuing to grow and improve more and more each year."
Alum,5,"Waynesburg University provides a place where students can grow in a Christian environment and have the opportunities to succeed. The professors and staff members genuinely care about your education and personal goals. The campus community is supportive, loving and helpful. Overall, I was able to be apart of many extracurricular activities on and off campus and had a blast over my tenure at Waynesburg."
Graduate Student,5,"I love the small campus atmosphere and tight nit community! My professors know my name and care about my learning. I have had such a great experience at this school for not only my undergraduate, but also my graduate degrees."
Freshman,5,At Waynesburg you have the chance to get to know your professors because of the small class sizes. Your professors you your name and know who you are and are willing to help you.
Junior,5,"Waynesburg is a beautiful, welcoming place where everyone is welcome! There is an overwhelming sense of community to be found by anyone from any background, and academics are challenging and prepare you for anything you may want to pursue after college. The atmosphere is always lively, and it's an overall great place to be."
Senior,5,"Really great place. It will challenge you academically and in your faith as well. I visited campus once and knew immediately that it was for me. The campus is small enough where I feel like I am part of a close community, but large enough where I actually feel that I am at college."
Freshman,5,"I love it here! It is like a family. Classes are small, the community is great. Only thing that I don't like is that there is nothing to do and no where to shop in town, but it is easy to travel nearby to get out of town!"
Sophomore,5,"Waynesburg University is a small Christian University that has provided me with some of the best experiences of my life.  By attending Waynesburg I am able to have close interactions with my professors, who will consistently work with me until I succeed.  I also have made life long friends who I now consider my family.  I love my university!"
Junior,5,"The community at Waynesburg is so rich and tight. I have met some of the best friends and mentors I've ever known there. The campus ministry is amazing, the professors truly care about each and every student, and the students can connect through so many different classes, activities, and common interests. There's no Greek life and very little partying, which suits certain people better than others but I definitely view it as a blessing, since I can easily focus on school without peer pressure and distractions. The one thing I would change is the food, but even that isn't too bad. It's certainly edible if not gourmet."
Sophomore,5,Waynesburg is a small Christian campus. It upholds the fundamentals of Christianity without forcing it on its students. The professors are nice and truly care about the students.
College Junior,5,"On the Waynesburg campus, I have left my laptop and backpack outside while I ran in to use the bathroom and nobody bothered my things while I was inside. I can leave my backpack at a table in the dining hall to reserve a seat and nobody bothers it. I can walk by myself anywhere and everyone is usually pleasant and smiles and says hello as we pass. It is a gorgeous campus and everyone looks out for each other."
College Sophomore,5,I always feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,A campus erupting with kindness everywhere you go.
College Junior,5,"I have made tons of meaningful and important professional connections through interactions with town members, teachers, and staff.  I have attended several conferences and events that will be huge advantages and experiences to reference during future interviews."
College Junior,5,I love not having Greek life on campus.  It makes campus more connected and community-like.
College Junior,5,"I love studying at Waynesburg University.  The staff and faculty are friendly and compassionate, it is easy and rewarding to get involved in campus and town life, and the courses are applicable and useful to specific majors."
College Junior,5,Just redid the whole dungeon looks amazing! New floors in the gym and getting new turf for the football field!
College Junior,5,It is such an amazing community and school!
College Freshman,5,Waynesburg takes value in preparing its student for their career.
College Freshman,5,I love being at Waynesburg University.
College Freshman,5,We do not have Greek Life on campus.
College Freshman,5,This school has been absolutely amazing for me.
College Freshman,5,"Each professor I've had so far in my college experience has helped me out in some way or another to become a better student. The campus is small, but has a very home-like feeling which makes everyone feel welcome. The small town around it reminds me of my home, which makes me feel even more comfortable. Though there are not parties that happen, there is a good amount of student activities during the week and even the weekends to make sure we have plenty of things to do."
College Sophomore,5,All the professors are wonderful and very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,I have a job on campus and I love it.
College Freshman,5,My major is athletic training and this school has an excellent degree program for it.  I started right away with athletic training classes and my degree program by semester is pretty  much mapped out for me.  They have a 90% + placement rate for this degree.  Class sizes are small and there is opportunity to interact with other students and professors in the classes if you need help.
College Freshman,5,"I love my school.  It is a small, private school that has Christian values while at the same time valuing the opinions of it's students.  It is easy to meet people and participate in extracurricular activities.  This school has all the aspects of a big university, but is actually smaller with a good teacher student ratio so you don't get lost in the crowd."
College Junior,5,"It is a school where you will grasp the sense of community as soon as you get here. As long as you can get over the small town, you will never regret it once you open up and meet all of the fantastic people."
College Freshman,5,I love the forensic science program. It is absolutely phenomenal.
College Freshman,5,Great selection. Great professors. Amazing.
College Freshman,5,"The programs, professors, and classes are all absolutely phenomenal. Small class sizes. Reasonable workload. Very good."
College Freshman,5,"I love the Communication program, its literally the only reason I came to this school. If you can suffer through everything else here you'll get a great education with definite job opportunities. But if I had to do it over again I would have picked somewhere with a decent program and I actually liked attending the school."
College Freshman,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus. The security staff are all very nice and accessible; you can always reach them by phone easily! We never have any safety issues of concerns on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Waynesburg's environment and the people just made me feel very comfortable right away. I felt God's presence here very strongly and know that I chose the right school. It always surprises people, but it's the only school I applied to! I never even visited campus before move-in day, and I love it."
College Freshman,5,So far I have only had one Psychology teacher but I love her. Her name is Jenny Jellison. Also I heard Dr. Reider is very good also. Work load is not bad at all. I did more work in high school. 
College Senior,5,The classes are small enough that every professor knows you by name and notices if you're not in class or if something is wrong. The professors will all go above and beyond to make sure the students understand what they are teaching and are all around just great.
College Senior,5,"The campus is extremely safe as long as you don't leave any valuables laying in your car or around campus, other than that there should be no problems."
College Senior,5,The fall on campus is absolutely beautiful. It snows a relatively small amount compared to the rest of the state and classes are cancelled if the weather will make commuting to campus difficult.
College Sophomore,5,"Waynesburg University has one of the best Pre-Med programs available. There are plenty of internships and opportunities to study abroad and do community service. Im currently a sophomore and so far I've had no problems with my classes, and have had a fairly light work load."
College Sophomore,5,"For being such a small college it offers very interesting majors. The amount of topics offered is great, and there are a boatload of opportunities to take nearly every class you want. The professors are very helpful, most of the work is done is school as opposed to home!"
College Sophomore,5,"I received a scholarship through the school and they helped with the rest of what I owed, including my payment and loans processes!"
College Junior,5,The Public Relations major is intense....in a good way. We are learning a lot and getting a great view into the industry.
Junior,4,"Due to the virus, I had to finish my sophomore year of college online. Surprisingly, it was not as bad as I thought it would be! I finished the semester strong and only had a few issues here and there. Something I did struggle with was how one teacher taught our class. She had the class through our Canvas chat. No video, no call. It was really hard, but I made it through. Other than that, I enjoyed having the online classes!"
Junior,4,Teachers and staff want to get to know you and want to help you succeed. Teachers are also very knowledgeable and have spent time in the field they are teaching and offer valuable insight and advice when you are looking for internships or careers in general
Sophomore,4,I like that Waynesburg’s tuition is cheaper than most colleges. I dislike that there are limited places to park on campus.
Junior,4,Waynesburg is a great school. Good academics and all of the professors are willing to help you. The one thing that could be changed is the nonexistence of off campus housing.
Sophomore,4,"I love the academics at Waynesburg university. The professors try their best to get to know all of their students in order to help them succeed at the university. I am majoring in a new major called forensic Investigation and I have had so much help transitioning from my previous major, forensic science. The one thing they could work on is the food."
Senior,4,The prices are a little high in see places. I would also really like if student workers were paid more than minimum wage.
Sophomore,4,Waynesburg University is a christian campus with a lot of on-campus activities to keep everyone busy. All of the students on campus are super nice and social.
Sophomore,4,Waynesburg is an excellent school. The professors are extremely nice and helpful and the people are super friendly.
Freshman,4,everyone on campus are so nice and would do anything to help a fellow classmate and the professors would do anything to help their students.
Senior,4,"* Great Christian atmosphere 
* Fun clubs & organizations
* AMAZING travel experiences
* Great teacher student ratio"
Junior,4,"I LOVE Waynesburg!! I wouldn't trade my experience here for the world. The people are truly amazing, and I love that our campus really comes together as a family. My faith has grown so much, and I owe that to this campus!"
Sophomore,4,"I love Waynesburg! The campus is small and has a strong community atmosphere. It is a Christian school, but they don't shove religion down your throat, which I think is nice! My experience has been great so far!"
Alum,4,Students come first! That's the motto of Student Services and Academics. Student Services creates lots of activities on and off campus. The Mission trips and academic trips are awesome!! Our professors really care about preparing WU students for the real world. The dining hall is pretty good too! Surrounded by the beauty of rolling hills and in the fall the trees are full of beautiful color!
Senior,4,There needs to be more parking for students and the food isn't that great. I like how small the class sizes are and just that it is a small private college.
Sophomore,4,"Waynesburg University has a fantastic academic atmosphere, especially in the criminal justice department. Although the athletics are lacking, the sports teams will still support the rest of campus. The party scene is virtually nonexistent, but campus is not far from WVU and the rest of Morgantown, WV."
Junior,4,"I like the service aspect of Waynesburg University. Also, it is not a party school, and the class sizes are relatively small."
Freshman,4,"Love the people and classes. Kind of boring on weekends. Not many parties, have to go to WVU or somewhere else nearby"
Freshman,4,"Ever since the day I moved in sometime in August, I have felt like this college is home to me. It is a smaller college, which makes things easier to do such as talk with your professors and such. I have enjoyed my experience with friends as well, really allows you to connect with other people! Being that it is a Christian university also allows you to attend chapel and experience things that most colleges would not offer or do. The dorm/living situation is not bad either! A lot of freshman complain about the dorms, I feel that they are sufficient enough for me and make me feel comfortable in my living situation. The food is not too bad either, it all depends on what you get! I tend to stay away from the chicken, sometimes it is overcooked and hard to eat! There are also a lot of events monthly to get the students involved and I really enjoy that too! Overall, my experience as a freshman at Waynesburg University has been pretty good! I would definitely recommend this school to others!"
College Sophomore,4,"I believe I am getting the education I need to pursue a career in the computer technology field, all while enjoying my dream of playing baseball at the college level."
College Sophomore,4,"I have been able to gain some quality experience already by working at the Information Technology Help Desk, and I have already discussed the possibility of a couple of internships. I hope these will be able to help me achieve full-time employment in the field upon graduation."
College Sophomore,4,"My professors seem to care about achieving success, and they will help in whatever way necessary to help me on my way to reaching my career and academic goals."
College Junior,4,"My class sizes are small, the campus is small. Coming from a small town to Waynesburg was easy. It was a seamless transition and I was accepted into the campus and community immediately which doesn't happen for me most places."
College Junior,4,"Waynesburg recently renovated the gym. It is nice and always seems clean but the air conditioning is still lacking. With all the windows on the front of the building, you have to go to the gym either early in the morning or after the sun goes down if you like it to be a little cool in there."
College Sophomore,4,"Dorm life is what you make of it, I choose to make it great, so it is!"
College Sophomore,4,The Gym is well attended.
College Freshman,4,This campus especially in the Nursing field aims for perfection and tries to see any nursing students succeed.
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on campus.
College Junior,4,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Waynesburg University.
College Junior,4,"The housing is not new or very spacious; however, it is adequate and appropriate for a small college campus."
College Freshman,4,We have good security and a safe and healthy atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"Housing is decent, but small areas."
College Freshman,4,The athletics are fairly decent.
College Freshman,4,"Waynesburg has a very welcoming, Christian community."
College Freshman,4,"There are security guards who make their way through the campus on a regular basis, and there has never been a problem with any assaults of any kind to my knowledge since I have arrived to Waynesburg University."
College Freshman,4,My experience has been great besides a few hiccups which were bound to happen because nothing can ever really be perfect. I've made a good amount of friends and have had good education.
College Freshman,4,The recruiters were extremely nice and very convincing to bring me to this campus.
College Freshman,4,"Some of the dormitories are not very nice compared to others. Also, loudness can sometimes be an issue when trying to sleep."
College Freshman,4,"There is plenty of sports going on on the campus. Other than the varsity sports, there are opportunities for students to create intramural teams and compete. The weight room/cardio room in the gym are very nice for students to use. There is also a separate room to work out specifically for the varsity athletes."
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on my campus. With 24/7 patrolling of security officers I feel like I could call them for anything. I even have their number saved in my phone
College Sophomore,4,Upperclassmen dorms look really nice.
College Sophomore,4,Athletics are pretty big and they get the student body involved.
College Sophomore,4,I love the Christian campus with the wonderful academics and the variety of sports to play.
College Freshman,4,Campus police are active at our school.  I feel safe on campus and haven't experienced any effects from crime since being here.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are relatively close together so it is easy to get to class.  I was able to pick my roommate ahead of time.  The social atmosphere is great, most of the athletes are housed in the same dorm which I really like.  The cost is kind of high to live in the dorms and this is a struggle for many  including me, even though I love the experience."
College Freshman,4,"I play football for this school and am a freshman. It was easy for me to get the information I needed to participate in football. This school has a large football team and the rest of the student body does a good job of supporting them and the other sports as well. School spirit is high, and the facilities we use for training are very good.  The different sports teams support each other and the school encourages athletes to also excel in the classroom."
College Sophomore,4,I like my school because it is small and it has a great education program which is my major. I love the beautiful campus and all of the people I have met here. I also love all of the ministries and christian groups on campus. I am very happy with my decision to come to Waynesburg.
College Freshman,4,"Waynesburg University has been a great place for me to start my college experience. It's just over two hours away from home, meaning it's close enough I can go home, but not so close that I go home all the time. Almost everyone I have met there has been friendly and kind, though of course there is some of the typical college drama. The professors are great and I love the fact that's it's a Christian school because they encourage you in Christianity, but don't force it on you."
College Senior,4,"Waynesburg University is a wonderful school. The faculty, teachers, and students are amzing and I could not ask for a better community. I have grown in my education and so much more."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of fast food restaurants but there are very little sit down restaurants. Also, the fast food places are not within walking distance so you need to have a car."
College Senior,4,I love my program. Other programs do not seem worth the money.
College Junior,4,Getting into the pre-pt program was easy.
College Junior,4,"It's very hard, since it's all science classes. However, the professors really prepare us for graduate school. Internships in the sciences are not that hard to find."
College Freshman,4,"Great majors. Hard to find internships, though. But, it's ok."
College Freshman,4,I've never felt unsafe at WU. The campus is filled with buildings and well-lit areas so it's very safe.
College Freshman,4,"Nursing, Criminal Justice, and Communication are fantastic! Anything else... I really hope you love this school if you come here for them."
College Freshman,4,Wireless everywhere but in the dorms. Although you have a connection you can just buy a router. Computer Labs and printers are easily accessible and free. The Mac Lab is phenomenal but is primarily used by Communication majors in the newspaper or for their classes.
College Freshman,4,"Campus Security is always around somewhere. While the campus is very safe, parties ALWAYS get busted at some point during the night."
College Freshman,4,Scholarships follow a scale based on GPA and SAT/ACT scores that I think helps out a lot if you did really well in one area but bad in another. But of course doing well in both gets you the highest amount. There are also service scholarships you can apply for.
College Freshman,4,"Nursing, Criminal Justice, and Communications are three phenomenal programs that really prepare you for a Career and have a lot of contacts that can get you jobs.Other than that everything is just your average college major."
College Senior,4,"There are people from many walks of life and international students are semi-common. Being an atheist at a christian university hasn't set me back, and from talking to others race and ethnicity are no issue. You see a lot of right-winged students here as well as faculty, however as with most things the students and professors here are nice and look at your personality and passion more than anything physical. There are a great deal of homosexual as well as non-denominational, agnostic, and atheist individuals here and everyone seems to get along well."
Sophomore,2,"the education there provided is great but the town has nothing in it and unless you own a car it's hard to do anything fun. also, you stand out if you're a minority and the majority of the population enjoys outdoor activities."
Freshman,2,HR is a load of crap. The nurse is a quack. They don't care about the well being of there students. They don't fix anything at the campus. THEY NEVER SALT SIDEWALKS. Most of the athletes do and deal drugs.
Alum,2,"You will encounter some good, and some very good professors but they are a small minority. If you study here, make sure to chose your professors with care to get some return on investment."
College Freshman,2,If you disagree with anyone on religious or acedemic beliefs then they will act fairly hostile towards you.
College Freshman,2,"In my honest opinion: the fellow students are typical friendly and sociable, some of the classes will give you a good education, however those are the only positive aspects of this place. I wish that I had never come here, and I recommend that anyone looking into here sees my review and avoids it. This place looks good on the outside, but once you enter it you realize that it is hollow and money hungry."
College Freshman,2,"I visited my school four times to make sure that it would be the right fit for me! The food on campus is absolutely horrid!! They also schedule classes during lunch hours but will not let you use a meal swipe after your class is over. You must pay out of pocket for it! I find this absolutely ridiculous! The campus is boring, aside from partying off campus there is not a whole lot to keep students busy. Yes, there are some events such as bingo but seriously, we're young adults here not old and this is most certainly not a nursing home. Another thing that was claimed to be ""forgot to mention"" on the tours was the face that we are required to live on campus for all four years. (Unless we are a commuter.) This outrages me though. You can not simply leave out these big rule changes while simply ""forgetting"" to mention to prospective students. It just makes me feel as though I should not be spending my heard earned money there if they can not be truthful."
College Senior,2,"I go to my school because my step mom also went to it. It is private and religious, neither of which appeal to me. Parties are nonexistent due to it being a dry campus. Overall, a rather boring school that tries to compensate for being dry with odd ""fun"" things for students to do (such as bingo nights)."
College Sophomore,2,The campus is dry so there are very little parties that happen
College Sophomore,2,"There is a wide variety of food to choose from but often times the food is not very good. Also, the lines in the cafe are very long and it often takes a long time to get your food."
College Senior,2,"You CANNOT do anything. There are curfew hours when the opposite sex cannot be in the dorms, not even in the lounge. The underclassmen dorms are loud, but nothing is usually done about it. You cannot just hang flyers up without permission."
College Senior,2,"There are only good scholarships if you are an incoming student. There are not sports scholarships. Even when getting the best grades, you do not get rewarded."
College Senior,2,"The off-campus houses are really hard to find and are incredibly expensive. You do have to sign a 12 month lease, so when you graduate or summer comes around, you still have your house."
College Junior,2,There is nothing around Waynesurg.
College Junior,2,Underclassman dorms are old and terrible.
College Junior,2,"It rains a good bit, and it snows a lot in the winter."
College Freshman,2,Just don't do it. It's not worth it. You don't want to live with the townies.
College Freshman,2,There's no nightlife. It's a dry campus so nothing is going on.
College Freshman,2,"People in the dorm I live in are very unkind. They're loud. Disrespectful, etc."
College Freshman,2,I don't know a thing about our sports.
College Freshman,2,Everyone's pretty cute but everyone's either in a relationship or they're just really mean.
College Freshman,2,"It's very easy to get in trouble, so, if you're coming to wu and plan on doing anything you should do, don't come."
College Freshman,2,While the academics are fantastic there was not a single other reason I wanted to come here. Because of this I don't like it here. Its boring and the weekends are the worst because everyone leaves.
College Freshman,2,Hot Rod's and Don Patron's are great but aren't necessarily cheap. There is also a Domino's and Chinese restaurant nearby that also deliver. Anything else you need a car to get to.
College Freshman,2,They will have sponsored events a school bus takes you on if you buy a ticket. (Penguin and Pirate Games for example) other than that I hope you have a car or you can't even go to Walmart.
College Freshman,2,"at 10pm on weekdays and midnight weeknights. At least that's what they tell you. I've been written up for a quiet hours violation before midnight on weekends and they insist its 10pm. Its not there is a board posted in every room and last time I just pointed at it and the RA went ""oh"" and walked away. Also, opposite gender guests need to be out of the dorms by midnight on weekdays and 2am weekends. To walk all the way across campus because that's how much they separate guys' and girls' dorms."
College Freshman,2,Male and Female Dorms are literally on opposite sides of campus. A lot of people do not understand how to live in a clean community environment. Visiting hours for opposite gender guests are strict and if you get caught you have to go through some form of disciplinary repercussions.
College Senior,2,"The campus is on one side of the town, all stores and most restaurants are on the other side. Driving there is really the best and only way. Waynesburg is not large but there is a good distance between the two sides. Campus shuttles can be rented for extended trips, but its much easier to have your own car with you."
College Senior,2,"Only 4 places here have an alcohol license, two being bars and only one of those is not run down. The other two places are local restaurants, both have great food and drink but aren't open that late. Generally people go to the restaurants to pre-game and eat then move to one of the two bars."
College Freshman,2,"There are not many places to eat off campus. There is a horrible Bob Evans (which I do not suggest), Hot Rod's (a local, sit down BBQ), a few Chinese places, a few fast food (McDonalds, Burger King, Wendys, DQ, Subway), and a bunch of piza places. Other than that, there is Sheetz and a few other minor places. You have to drive about half an hour away to Morgantown, WV or Washington, PA to find anything else (although Morgantown is a major college town and has a much better variety)."
College Freshman,2,"The dorm halls are very old and should be remodeled. The paint is pretty old and the bathrooms aren't the cleanest except for the ones in the halls in the middle of campus. I would remodel the halls as a whole. From the outside they seem average, but it is a lot different on the inside. I would recommend taking a tour of the different dorms to get a close up view and talk to the students that live on campus.   "
College Senior,2,The nearest place is a half hour away. 
College Senior,2,There's no where to go around campus so you need a car to get anything or do anything. 
College Senior,2,The nurses aren't very helpful and are never there. 
College Senior,2,Very strict but I know someone who got away with underage drinking because they played a sport. 
College Senior,2,The teachers don't help. At other schools that offer pre-vet they take more animal related classes. 
College Senior,2,There's nothing around to do. 
College Freshman,2,"Heroin is big here. Other stuff like alcohol and weed don't seem like that big of a deal when you've seen a pencil thin heroin addict stumble into class. Other then that, this is a famously dry school."
College Freshman,2,"It's a small town, so there's not very many options. Also, if you don't have a car, these restaurants aren't even accessible."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to do outside of campus and the county is one of the poorest in the state. 
College Freshman,2,"I don't have a car, but a lot of upperclassmen complain about finding parking spots. Parking spots are very limited. "
College Freshman,2,Other then one teacher I don't really like any of my teachers. Most of them are strange and my one teacher laughs at himself creepidly. 
College Freshman,2,i don't really know. my dad helped pay for everything.
College Freshman,2,"There is no public transportation at Waynesburg University.  If you have a car, places are relatively close to campus.  If you don't have a car, most likely you will meet people who do have a car and can take you somewhere."
College Freshman,2,Waynesburg does not offer any public transportation to students. We are basically on our own. We have shuttles but they are used for specific reason upon special request.
College Junior,2,"Diversity: ehh, could be better 
Acceptance: I know some people of different sexual orientations, religious affiliations, or political opinions do not feel they can openly express themselves without immediate opposition. 
Sexual orientation: homosexuality not widely accepted and gay people do not feel comfortable being open about their sexual orientation for fear of not being acceptance and/or discrimination"
College Senior,2,"Overall, there is not much ethnic diversity at Waynesburg. Coming from an ethnically diverse home in California, I was a little shocked about the lack of ethnic diversity. However, students were very accepting of those who were ethnically diverse. Every student on campus was very open minded and accepting when it came to different issues such as ethic diversity, political beliefs or economic background."
College Senior,2,"Not Much to Do – The borough of Waynesburg has little to do for college students aside from a handful of mom and pop restaurants and a Walmart (if you can find a ride to get there/have a car). The area near the college (downtown) is safe and well-lit at night, making midnight walks to Sheetz a popular activity among students without a reliable mode of transportation."
College Junior,2,"The food isn't the best in the cafe, but its all you can eat and there's a variety. The bee hive on the other hands has good food but its the same thing all the time and its only a serving size."
College Junior,2,"Mostly whites, with a few blacks and Hispanics. Not that its the universities fault, many of the minorities go elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,"It it was nice I guess, not too exciting though – Everyone at Waynesburg is really nice but overall there's just nothing to do. The surrounding town gives you very little options and the school will bring in entertainment every now and again. In the end the school just wasn't for me, the rules were too strict and there was just nothing to do which is why I plan on transferring out."
College Sophomore,2,"Whatever you do, don't live in Ray! I lived in Ray for most of my freshman year. The hall was generally loud despite quiet hours, and everyone always seemed to be some kind of fight. The hall is small and you can practically hear the people nest to you everytime they breathe. I eventually moved to burns, which was better but still not that good of a dorm. The people didn't fight as much but the walls were just as thin. Overall I'd give the underclassman dorms a C- at best"
College Sophomore,2,They're not awful but they're also not the top in the country. They'll teach you what you need to know.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not enough on campus parking for all of the students that have cars. The parking permits are only $20, which is super cheap, but it might take you awhile to find a decent space near your dorm or on campus."
College Freshman,2,I think that the school is too strict. They want guy visitors out of the dorms by midnight. It is a dry campus so no alcohol is allowed. Drugs are prohibited and noise complaints are common.
College Freshman,2,"Almost every other day it rains at Waynesburg.  A  lot of people have called it Rainsburg due to this.  It definitely makes you tired and not want to do anything. I hate walking in the rain at 8 in the morning.  There have been some days where the weather was almost 80 degrees, and a group of us were outside taking walks and playing cornhole."
College Freshman,2,"Small Town Living – Although some people may enjoy the small town life, I find it to be painfully remote, and quite boring. I would not recommend this school to those who want a real college experience."
College Junior,2,"Medocore Experience – Waynesburg, is a very interesting school. This was the third school I attended. I do not feel as though it is the best choice, but I suppose academically, it is where it should be. You must study here in order to succeed. Socially, if you have a great group of friends to make things fun then you'll be fine."
College Freshman,2,there is not much to do off campus. There is one local restraunt that is within walking distance. But other than that there is chain food  where you need to drive to get there.
College Junior,2,Waynesburg's campus really needs more parking on the campus. There is not enough parking for the number of parking passes that are handed out on the campus or the number of students and teachers.
College Junior,2,"Needs Much Improvement – There are two places to eat on the campus. The main cafe and the bee hive, which is a grab and go food service. The food quality could be much better and the prices could be a little cheaper. In the bee hive there is very little variety in the food and they serve a lot of fried foods. The quantity of the food that the bee hive serves is in no way enough for a meal. In the main cafe there are more options and you can go back up and get as much food as you want. The quality of the food is not always the greatest."
Junior,1,"Do not go to this University unless you're going for nursing or criminal justice. There are no redeeming factors for the way this institution runs other than the people you meet, the community. DO NOT fall for their scholarship offers, I was utterly miserable at my time there.
- Academics are terribly easy and a waste of time.

-The campus buildings are ugly and in disrepair, the library is reminiscent of a prison. 

-Food is served for very small periods of time, and it isn't good either.
 
-If you're a night owl wanting to work on projects, you're out of luck since all campus buildings are closed between 8pm and midnight.

-Dorms are small and very cramped, even the suites.

-Surrounding areas are EXTREMELY impoverished and uncomfortable. The parks and roads are literally crumbling.

-There is essentially nothing to do unless you have a car. Also, all dorms have visiting hours for members of the opposite sex. Having your boy/girlfriend over for the night is a no go."
Freshman,1,"This is an excuse of a college. If you go here you will not get a true college experience. They will randomly search you (and claim it’s from social media. even tho no videos of alc were posted) just to ruin your night. then they’ll charge you $100 minimum for having it. This place was the worst decision i’ve ever made. Everyone is either rude or just downright weird. No one likes to just hangout and chill, they’re all boring."
Freshman,1,"I want everything to change here. The food was terrible and constantly upset my stomach. The nurse is a quack. The administrators are unhelpful, and sometimes not even for your major. The town school barely salts the sidewalks, they just leave all the salt for an entire sidewalk in little piles every twenty feet or so, this way you fall down the stairs of your dorm but no one cares because they “salted the sidewalks” the town doesn’t care to salt the road until it’s too late and you slip all over the place. There’s no parking, the upperclassmen are rude. Honestly, just not worth it."
College Junior,1,not much to do in town. Plus people are stupid about it
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek Life on our campus.
College Junior,1,You can't do anything here.
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek Life. It got thrown out and will most likely not be back.
College Freshman,1,Nightlife consists of sitting in a dorm with friends (if they stay on campus) until curfew hits. Or you could always go to the house parties that get busted every night.
College Freshman,1,"At least two thirds of the students leave on weekends. Any party gets busted because the cops have nothing better to do in this little town. If you have a car, WVU and Pittsburgh are nearby but other than that you are stuck in your dorm with a small group of people who stay."
College Freshman,1,"None. You have to go up to Morgantown, etc. if you want to go to parties or clubbing. Very little partying goes on on campus."
College Freshman,1,We have no Greek life...
College Senior,1,Always raining. The campus never salts fast enough during winter. 
College Senior,1,There's no where to eat other than 3 places and only one of them is open late. 
College Senior,1,Printers are always broken. The internet is always down and it gives you viruses. 
College Senior,1,Only girls get off campus housing and the school takes so much away from scholarships. 
College Senior,1,"Little parking, not enough spaces for all the students and teachers to park. "
College Senior,1,It tastes so bad and never fills you up. There's already any choices and they are open at the worst possible times. 
College Freshman,1,There is always the same food. Sometimes they even heat up the food from the beginning of the week and serve it again. I can't really eat the food anymore because it makes me sick. 
College Freshman,1,You're not allowed to move off campus until your senior year. We do have off campus housing but usually you can only get in them if you play a sport.

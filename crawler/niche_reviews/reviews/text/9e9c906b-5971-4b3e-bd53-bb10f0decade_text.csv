Alum,5,Moravian College is a wonderful college with a special community. I enjoyed my four years there and my experiences helped me grow as a person. The faculty and staff are very supportive and I would highly recommend attending this college!
Alum,5,"Although I graduated from Moravian in 1996, I have stayed active and involved. Based upon my personal experiences as a student and since, I have the highest praise for Moravian and the value it delivers. I also completed graduate and law school at other  institutions, as well as had four siblings attend various colleges similar in size, and, in my opinion, the overall Moravian experience met or exceeded each of those institutions."
Alum,5,"Given that I attended 1992-96, there was no online component to my education at Moravian.  Evidently, however, I have to fill this out to submit my review."
Senior,5,Professors adapted very well to the online learning. Some better than others and some more understanding of the stressful situation than others but overall a very good experience.
Sophomore,5,"This year I was an incoming freshman at Moravian college. I super nervous because everything was extremely new. By the end of this first year, I could not believe how many people I met and how many friends I made. I went from not knowing anyone to making tons of new friends. This was great because that's all I wanted when arriving to the college was being able to make friends easily."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful, teachers are helpful, and most importantly the college President is amazing. The school thoroughly prepares you for any future career you wish to pursue."
Sophomore,5,"I took some courses online due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The school was extremely accommodating. All professors and many clubs were given full access zoom accounts, and I was even able to meet with my advisor over zoom. It is extremely helpful that Moravian College provides its students with a MacBook Pro and iPad because these made online learning much easier and effective."
Freshman,5,"I had a great experience at Moravian College, everyone was very friendly and helpful. I love the campus, it is small but very nice. They have state of the art medical equipment which is very nice, I highly recommend visiting."
Sophomore,5,this school is amazing! i am currently a sophomore and i love everything about moravian! i can’t imagine being anywhere else!
Niche User,5,I will be attending Moravian College next year as a freshman.  I am very excited to start my journey at the perfect place for me.  I will be studying nursing and I cannot wait to become a hound.
Freshman,5,"lecture hall classroom compared to other universities, the classrooms are much smaller and the professors work with you one on one compared to them just writing on the chalkboard and then everyone else is jotting down notes. There are also many different clubs that you can join as well so that you don't feel excluded and especially if you're a commuter such as myself. I chose Moravian College because I plan on majoring in accounting and I hopefully plan on getting my MBA and CPA license by the time I graduate. Moravian College also relieves the load on your tuition with many scholarships that will make college much more affordable. I'm very excited to start my journey as an accountant and I hoped this helped you make a decision on where you would like to spend the next four years as a college student!"
Sophomore,5,"Moravian is the perfect small school for me! All of the professors and staff are passionate about their work and the students. I love having a sports field in the middle of campus, it's a place where everyone (even nonathletes) can hang out."
Sophomore,5,"Moravian is open to everyone. Even if you feel like you won't fit in, they make sure there's a spot there for you to feel comfortable and welcome."
Niche User,5,Such a friendly place that allows you to be yourself. The professors are very supportive as well as admissions. Moravian looks at you as an individual not as a group. Each student is given a special path to give them their future dreams.
Sophomore,5,"I transferred here for the music program, and I love it. My professors are fantastic; I have no professor from which I have trouble learning. The students are incredibly kind and caring. It is part of the school's mission to be friendly and welcoming to everyone you meet. It is also in a beautiful location. The surrounding town is filled with restaurants and shops."
Sophomore,5,I like the overall diversity and education aspects of the school. I would like to see more diversity in the Fraternities  on campus.
Senior,5,The professors at Moravian always seek the students interests and well-being. Moravian wants every student to succeed and also balance a healthy social-academic life.
Junior,5,"Moravian cares about you as a student. You are not a number. I have a great relationship with my professors & visibly see where my money goes because there are CONTINUOUS improvements and renovations. If there is a concern, it is already addressed before risen. Great college for first-generation college students. I have had opportunities to travel as well. Everyone genuinely cares about you."
Alum,5,"Moravian College is a small, private liberal arts college in Bethlehem, PA. Moravian professors are both inspiring and dedicated to the success of their students. Moravian prepared me academically and professionally for a graduate career at an ivy league institution."
Freshman,5,"The students and staff are generally helpful and nice, the campus is a nice place, and it’s close to where I live (walking distance)."
Alum,5,"Moravian is average on paper in terms of admissions, etc., but students who go here have so many opportunities it is crazy. Professors are almost always willing to offer independent studies, research opportunities, and just general mentorship to students who want a challenge. Someone who is driven can do a self-designed or interdepartmental major in literally almost any area you can think of. There are limitless possibilities for students who want to excel and the campus and surrounding town is a great place to live."
Freshman,5,"What I like about Moravian College is that the campus is so beautiful and is very clean. The people are nice and they do not hesitate to you no matter what the problem is. The professors, as far as my experience has been, have been wonderful. The library is such a good place to study and to get help with papers and things like that. They even have coffee for one dollar until 4 pm. everyday except the weekends obviously. As far as the safety goes, Moravian College has its own police station and it makes me feel very safe. One thing I would love to change is the fact that the tuition is so expensive, but the quality of everything is fantastic. The housing is not the best in some dorms because of the heat/ac conditions and the lack of modern furniture because the college is so old!!"
Senior,5,"When I visited Moravian College as a senior in High School, I knew right away this was the school for me. The campus is small, but gorgeous. Beautiful, historic buildings, a fresh new turf field, and trees and flowers everywhere. North and South Campus are only a mile and a half apart, and the walk down historic Bethlehem's Main Street is one that tourists come to see from all over America.  The professors are top notch and really invest in their student's lives. The alumni network can't be beat, and alum often visit back to share internship and employment opportunities and words of wisdom. Moravian's rich history, culture, diversity, AND small town vibe is something that not many colleges can offer."
Sophomore,5,"I love Moravian College because I received an amazing college experience.  The professors go over and beyond to provide help to the students. The classes are tough, but as long as you put the effort in, it is worth it. The campus is very beautiful and is also dog friendly! The people who attend Moravian College are down to earth and approachable.  Truly a fabulous experience!"
Niche User,5,I like the community feeling at Moravian. Everyone held the door for everyone and the staff is very welcoming.
Sophomore,5,I love that Moravian College is small because you actually get to connect with the professors. The professors make an effort to get to know their students. I cannot wait to continue my education at Moravian College.
Niche User,5,I love the local area of Bethlehem and the community on-campus. The campus is wonderful and not that large. There aren't too many students and the MacBook and iPad are a plus. ;)
Alum,5,Moravian College provides a tremendous education and experience.  I graduated in 1996 and would pick Moravian again today.
Junior,5,I love Moravian. I am a junior this year and I haven't had one terrible professor yet.  The safety on campus is very good and there are always officers around on call. 
College Freshman,5,"If I could do the whole college picking all over again I do believe I would still choose Moravian College, because it is just a great college. I feel very comfortable here, and I am thankful for this experience."
College Junior,5,I love the overall experience I've had at Moravian so far. It's been an amazing journey working with so many professors who love what they teach.
College Senior,5,"Class size is small, even in the Nursing program. Get to know your professors because they are the best parts about this school!"
College Senior,5,"At smaller schools, professors care about individual students; therefore, students are more dedicated to their studies and motivated to succeed."
College Freshman,5,"I would choose Moravian College again and again if I could. The dedication of the professors and staff to help you succeed is unbelievable, and the trips and activities offered to keep students involved are enjoyable and abundant."
College Sophomore,5,I am in a sorority and I love it! All of the chapters are close and Greek unity is promoted.
College Junior,5,The career center staff are amazing.
College Junior,5,This is the best decision I've ever made.
College Junior,5,"Moravian's culture and community are unlike any other school I've visited during the college admissions process. The undergraduate enrollment is under 2,000 students and that is my favorite characteristic of my school. You know someone every where you go on campus, you can get involved in any of the various clubs we offer, sports teams are inclusive and competitive, the Greek Life option exists yet doesn't pressure any student involvement. In addition to the extracurricular would being full of opportunities, the classroom size is an exceptional learning environment. Professors know you personally, are available for help whenever you need it, are willing to make appointments with you to fit your schedule, and there are many programs to offer additional academic assistance if necessary. The resources available to students as career finders, employment opportunities, and alumni connections are highly effective."
College Junior,5,"There are campus safety vehicles everywhere, adequate lighting, blue light buttons to press if you feel in danger, and secure locking systems that require a swipe and a key to enter a room or building"
College Sophomore,5,"I love being a part of Greek life here. It's not too big, so you have a great relationship with not only all the people in your own Greek organization, but you also work with the other Greek organizations to plan events and help the community."
College Junior,5,"Greek Life is very active on campus with their philanthropies and support of other organizations. Moravian College wants to promote professional development, and interpersonal connections between all Greek Organizations, so a ""Goldstar Program"" was created. This program is unique to Moravian and is a requirement to all Greek Organizations. It requires the sororities and fraternities to hold different events together to promote friendships and unity. Non-Greek students are supportive of Greek students and vice versa. Because Moravian College is such a small campus, all organizations and clubs try to support one another as well as they can. All Greek organizations offer housing options. The sororities have beautiful Victorian style houses and the fraternities have modern on-campus Hillsides (similar to condominiums)"
College Junior,5,"Moravian College offers so many different opportunities to students. I am in a strong and competitive Nursing program that has an amazing relationship with the surrounding hospitals, allowing me to experience 16 clinical hours a week on the hospital floor and special experiences in the Operating Room, Delivery Room, Wound Care clinic, Pediatric and Neonatal ICU, and many others. All of my professors are approachable, understanding, and helpful. Moravian offers Greek Life, clubs, sports teams, and volunteer opportunities to enable students to find their ""home"" in whichever activity suits them. If I had to go through the college selection process again, I would chose Moravian each and every time."
College Sophomore,5,The Nursing Department really helps you to become successful in your field and when you leave here you will be ready for the workforce.
College Sophomore,5,I love all my courses and professors at this school.  The professors take the time to get to know you personally and are there to help you with anything you may need!
College Sophomore,5,I love being part of the Greek Life and helping out with the community.
College Sophomore,5,I love my experience here at Moravian College and I do believe that I am getting the education I need to be successful.
College Junior,5,Their are a very diverse students on the campus and are involved with all the other students.
College Junior,5,I have never felt unsafe on the campus and I was never approached about doing drugs.
College Junior,5,I have never felt unsafe on this campus and I know that their are people to talk to if I ever needed someone to speak to.
College Junior,5,"No matter where you go, their will always be courses and professors you are not huge fans of. Most of mine I have been huge fans of, have built professional relationships with and have enjoyed it!"
College Junior,5,I believe this school offers many different types of jobs and internships on and off campus. I have been able to have internships on and off campus.
College Junior,5,I am apart of Greek Life and it was such a great decision. I have had so many different opportunities and have also met so many different people.
College Junior,5,"Overall my experience at Moravian has been a wonderful one! I have been able to get all the classes I wanted, joined a numerous amount of clubs, and have broaden my horizon. No matter where you go it will never be perfect, their will always be professors that you are not a fan of or the food is not always the best, but while at Moravian, I have been beyond pleased."
College Freshman,5,"I may only be a freshman coming into his second semester of college at Moravian, but my experience has been amazing. Moravian College has given me an amazing college experience that makes me look forward to the future. From helping me choose a career path, to finding something fun to do on a Friday night, Moravian has it all. I couldn't have asked for a better school to attend. Being a student-athlete, and being involved with extracurricular activities to help better my school and community, I have taken advantage of the resources presented to me by Moravian College. I could not have chosen a better college to recieve of high education"
College Sophomore,5,"The course load is hard, but rewarding."
College Sophomore,5,Greek life is like having a support system. They represent the school and Greek life they are associated with with pride.
College Senior,5,"Moravian college supplies students with a interactive liberal arts experience. The students at Moravian are not just simply a number. Professors truly get to know each student on a personal level. Being the sixth oldest college in the United States, Moravian offers rich historical value to the surrounding area."
College Sophomore,5,"Moravian has been amazing. As a current sophomore, my love for this school hasn't descreased. For such a small school, there's a sense of community that you just can't get at a big school. The faculty is qualified and incredible. There is always something to do around here, either at school, through school, or downtown. It's wonderful having such a historically rich school, as well. Over 270 academic years, founded by a women, and plenty more things to be proud of. It's always a good day to be a hound!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"My undergraduate experience at Moravian College transformed me from a timid high schooler to a much more outgoing and confident person. I never thought I would be comfortable going into a job interview, but because the professors encourage students to engage in class, I was ready. 

I fell in love with Bethlehem while at Moravian, I definitely recommend going to eat on Main Street whenever you are in town."
College Junior,5,Moravian is exactly what college is supposed to be about! It helps you expand socially and intellectually through academics and organizations on campus. The size of the school has so many benefits because it is very easy to get involved and work up to the top. The professors know you on a name to name basis instead of just being a number at a larger school. There are so many things to get involved in! Plus the school is absolutely beautiful with the historic touch on each of the buildings but the new technology to get students hands on with the all the software used in today's world. Moravian is an awesome place to be!
Sophomore,4,"Although I didn't intend on taking online classes at Moravian, we were forced to when the COVID- 19 pandemic started. The teachers did their absolute best to teach the information online and made sure we had everything that we needed to succeed. The only problem that occurred was that the classes I was taking at the time were extremely hard and even harder to not be taught in person. I realized that a lot of other student's classes were the same way and that is not the professor's fault."
Junior,4,I love Moravian College. The close-knit community feeling you have here is unlike anything I felt visiting any other college or university. The only thing I would like to see change is for them to improve housing affordability.
Freshman,4,I really love the food on campus and all the activities that you can get involved in. The staff are pretty friendly and most of my teachers are very helpful and supportive.
Freshman,4,As I am going into my second semester at Moravian College I am really happy with this school. The students and faculty are extremely kind and are super accommodating with anything you may need. There is always activities planned throughout the week as well as therapy dogs before finals week! There are also many trips that you may sign up for and it is a great experience to meet people
Niche User,4,I liked my tour of Moravian College because I felt like it was a perfect fit for my personality. I also felt as if their curriculum would set me up perfectly for my future.
Sophomore,4,The music department staff  is absolutely engaging and stimulating.  I love my classes and extra curricular activities.
Freshman,4,Moravian College is a wonderful liberal arts school. The campus is beautiful and there are many opportunities for the students that attend here. They provide many events to be able to connect and socialize with other students on campus. There are many chances to go forward and progress in your career starting from the moment you start college here. The staff are great as well.
Sophomore,4,"Everyone there is kind and the sense of community is strong there. My only problem is financial aid and students account there because neither communicates with each other like they should, causing issues."
Niche User,4,"As a family on tour with our prospective freshman student (2020), we found the open house event to be well run and informative. campus is beautiful and accessible, academic buldings are up to date in the ways that matter, and we enjoyed our visit. Humanities dean presenting that whole groups of majors was rather one-note in presentation, but is not the primary professor so that is not a concern. dorms are standard, but clean, with great upperclassmen options and guaranteed housing all four years."
Sophomore,4,"Moravian College is very diverse and inclusive. The atmosphere is pleasant and welcoming. Even though it has a smaller student body than most colleges, there's a solid chance you'll find a group you fit into. It's a liberal arts college, so you're forced to take a course in art and and one in history, etc. So if you really don't like those types of guidelines, Moravian wouldn't be your fit."
Sophomore,4,"Moravian is a very good school. Their courses are diverse, along with the student population. Going to such an accepting school is a wonderful experience."
Senior,4,I love being at Moravian and all the opportunities/experiences I’ve had as I’m going into my last year there. The small college gets the teachers to know me and I’m able to not just feel like a number.
Senior,4,Moravian College is technologically advanced and on the right road to integrating all the newest technologies both in and out of the classroom. It's friendly atmosphere allows for a comfortable environment and a beautiful campus on top of that. The president works courageously to ensure the best for the students and it truly is a wonderful institution and the faculty are some of the best in the Lehigh Valley!
Freshman,4,"Overall Moravian is a really good school, and a lot of the professors work close to you to ensure you achieve your goals as a student. Like any other school, it still also has professors that don't do anything and grade harshly by taking off points for no reason, but there are more good professors than bad. The campus is beautiful all year round, and sometimes classes are held outside."
Junior,4,"The student body is small, so everyone is very involved with one another. The staff is very involved with the students education and is always there for help if you need it. I would change how administration is as they mess up when it comes to applying loans to the overall student balances and are hard to get a hold of."
Junior,4,Love the school! The class sizes are pretty small which works well with students like myself because it gives you a more one on one learning environment. Teachers are all very willing to go that extra mile and work with you until you understand the material.
Sophomore,4,"I like the small class sizes because your professors can really get to know you. It's definitely less of a party school than most bigger schools and even neighboring Lehigh University, but it is still college. I'm not a party person, so adjusting to loud music on the weekends was hard. It's still an amazing college!"
Sophomore,4,"I’m only halfway through my time at Moravian but I still have a few things to say. I think that Moravian’s dining and housing could both use work. They moved the Starbucks into a new building which makes it harder for a lot of students to get coffee before class. As for housing, there is not really enough housing and I think many of the dorms should be renovated."
Niche User,4,"I loved Moravian so much, especially their new health building. It was built with perfect timing, because I may hopefully go there next year! The campus was beautiful, and it was the perfect size for me. It has a nice amount of Greek life and lots of clubs too, but not too much that you feel like you have to be in one! They also have intramural sports and sports for the school, so there is something for everyone. The people I met were so nice and polite. Overall, it was a great experience and I loved the campus and the people!"
Freshman,4,"This is my first year here and it's honestly a really small college but I don't mind the size of it. It's very comforting very close to my home, has a very open community. It's easy to communicate with the professors they truly help you out whenever you need it."
Sophomore,4,I like the size of the school and the fact that the people there actually care about you and your success. I also love the small class sizes and how comfortable I feel whenever I am in my classes.
Sophomore,4,"A small, personable experience with a lot of opportunities to grow. It's definitely what you make of it, the academics aren't particularly challenging. The education program is excellent, gets you in the field right away. Have not met an awful professor yet. All are fair, caring and knowledgeable."
Freshman,4,Coming to Moravian was a little e hard for me because this was not my intended school. So for my first month or so I just stayed in my dorm and did nothing but eat sleep and work. I then decided that I am here and let us make the best of it. Coming to Moravian everyone was so welcoming and friendly. That made me feel so much better about coming here and meeting new people. The work was not as hard as I expected because this is a private school. My entire outlook has changed on Moravian since I have become a student here. We are a family and you are never alone unless you really want to be. 
College Junior,4,"The academics are great. Scheduling days are based on grade. You register first if you are a rising senior, second if you are a junior, and so on. 

Courses are great."
College Senior,4,Employers recruit all of the time - just make the effort to stand out!
College Senior,4,"I'm in nursing school, but as a field hockey player, I like to relax and watch others now!"
College Sophomore,4,Bethlehem is generally a safe area. A lot of updates we get are nothing to be worried about as they are usually minor.
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of people have a good reputation in mind when they think of Moravian, especially when it comes to Nursing. It makes it easy to get internships and eventually to land a job as there are also a lot of connections you can make."
College Sophomore,4,Moravian just recently built a new gym and it's really nice. The hours are flexible too and open during the summer when classes are not in session.
College Sophomore,4,Moravian is great for the amount of opportunities you are given. The only reason I did not like Moravian at first is because I wanted to go to a bigger school.
College Sophomore,4,"The college makes a big stand against sexual assault, even going as far as to make students sit through a long presentation at the beginning of each semester."
College Junior,4,Upperclassmen housing options are good.
College Junior,4,I think the social experience at Moravian has impacted my experience positively. It allows you to have fun and meet new people. Parties mainly take place on Saturdays. The best parties are generally at OGO or a sports team. It depends on the weekend. I think a lot of people on campus enjoy participating in the night life on campus
College Junior,4,"There are many options at Moravian. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, many people go to the bars, and most bars are not strict with underage people if they have fake IDs. Parties take place mainly on Saturdays and are presents at sports houses, fraternities, or even dorms."
College Junior,4,"the professors are engaged and helpful, most curriculums are rigorous and focus on career development and experience. There are many program tracts that include field experience for education, clinical for nursing, and internships for business and management tracts. Workload varies on the major and the semester. I think the most popular major at Moravian is Nursing. It is extremely popular, yet extremely rigorous"
College Sophomore,4,Campus safety is always around and we have places all around campus where you can hit a button if you need help.
College Junior,4,"I have been to many different professional development events through my major and professors to meet different recruiters and people that could help advance my career. Through different clubs and activities, there is resume and career development, as well as seminars, conferences, and panels to aid students in professional connections and development. Moravian offers specific networking events for different students depending on area of study, whether or not they area  student athlete, etc."
College Junior,4,"My instructors are amazing. All of my nursing instructors are registered nurses and are great at teaching and providing great quality care on the clinical floor as well. My Gen-Ed courses also included some great teachers that tried to engage all of the students in the classroom, regardless of their major. At Moravian there is a variety of classes. Some classes such as sciences offer more tests and quizzes that are multiple choice or fill ins. For people who aren't as great at these forms of assessments, there are other classes that offer more papers, presentations, and creative projects."
College Junior,4,"I play soccer here at Moravian College, and about 50% of the student population plays on a Varsity sport team. Very often, the varsity games have very good support from the campus, and Moravian College offers good incentives to promote attendance. There is an overwhelming amount of school spirit and ""Hound"" pride for the teams. The athletic facilities are great and Moravian is actually expanding their athletic facilities. We will be receiving a new turf field and athletic complex which will be exciting for everyone."
College Sophomore,4,We're definitely getting better regarding sports teams.
College Sophomore,4,I like that the school isn't too big. It's nice to have a one-on-one relationship with professors.
College Sophomore,4,Campus Safety is always driving around and always only a phone call away.
College Sophomore,4,The campus housing here is nice!
College Sophomore,4,This school comes together very nicely and shows a lot of support towards the athletes.
College Junior,4,I believe that the dorms are the best a dorm could possibly be.
College Junior,4,Overall I believe that the athletic area at Moravian College is a great one. Many students are involved in them but not so many that they over run everything. I think it would be great to see more intramural diversity.
College Freshman,4,I have never personally felt unsafe on campus but there are blue lights everywhere as well as everyone receives the emergency number for campus security during orientation. They also have hotlines in place in case things happen.
College Freshman,4,"For the most part, everything is great. I had two professors that were absolutely horrible but I still managed a B in the classes. The course work can be really hard and slightly intimidating but that can be expected of biochemistry."
College Freshman,4,I have never considered joining a sorority but a lot of the sororities and fraternities take part in fundraisers for the school.
College Freshman,4,A lot of students take part in watching sports and encouraging the teams.
College Freshman,4,I love the school. Most classes were worth taking.
College Senior,4,"I always see campus safety on campus and around the parking lots. There are also multiple signs around campus and in every bathroom regarding contact for support for sexual assault victims. I personally have not heard of any reports  of sexual assault in my time there. I have heard of a few accounts of suspicious activity, but emails and notifications were sent in a timely and appropriate manner."
College Freshman,4,"Moravian College has a strong athletic foundation which has been cultivated fairly recently in comparison to the schools, academic lifespan. There are always student advertisements posted all over the campus to support the various athletic groups. Some of the most popular around the college is the Greyhound Football team, boys' and girls' soccer teams and  the cross country team. Moravian's athletic program is very influential to the student body and has boosted the college's recognition and reputation."
College Freshman,4,"Moravian College's reputation and mission makes it a great place to learn and set up one's self for their future careers. I am very happy that I am a part of this great school, and even though it is very expensive, I feel that the educational experience is worth my effort in working hard to achieve my career goal as a music educator."
College Sophomore,4,"Moravian is improving everyday, I am proud to say that I will graduate from Moravian College."
College Sophomore,4,"I am in the addventure program, which has allowed me a lot of flexibility within my major."
College Sophomore,4,"The Neuroscience program at Moravian College is led by a professor who is extremely educated in what she does. Also, I love the feeling of family there is at Moravian."
College Junior,4,"I love Moravian College! The faculty and staff truly care about each student and are there for you in any way they can be, even if it is not at all related to academics. The small class sizes allow me to better learn and the professor are accessible to me as a student. There are a wide variety of clubs and organizations to get involved with and the opportunities are endless."
College Freshman,4,My school challenged myself and every student academically and I believe it is what separates my school from the rest. It is a friendly and warm environment. I enjoyed it and would not have wanted to attend any other school.
College Junior,4,"I love my school, it's small and the classes are small as well."
Sophomore,2,Literally nothing to do. Party’s suck and school is really hard. Very disappointing. Doesn’t even feel like I’m at college.
Junior,2,"Basically if you aren't a fake or snake type person you will hate this place. Theres about 3 real people here. Parties are usually trash, you gotta be pretty lit to have fun. Will say they do offer pretty good resources and some professors really care and are helpful. Not enough housing. Pretty campus tho"
Senior,2,"Moravian is a strong Humanities school however, their science department is sorely lacking not only in resources but in educational quality. Prospective college students considering a major in a science or mathematics field should avoid choosing Moravian, particularly those aspiring a career in medicine. Prospective English majors, however, may benefit from the traditional style of academics and resources offered by the humanities departments."
Freshman,2,The diversity sucks. It is a rich white person-run school. There is hardly anything to do on campus. There is only 3 frat houses so parties are super limited and are usually ended by a fire department showing up.
College Sophomore,2,"There's a lot of white students, black students (mostly there for athletics) and a handful of Saudi Arabians.."
College Sophomore,2,I had a bunch of people in my suite last semester drinking alcohol and it was bad.
College Junior,2,"I don't think Moravian is very diverse. There are several international students and the number is growing each year, however, the majority of the campus population is white, non hispanic."
College Freshman,2,"The typical Moravian student's looks are average, their interests are not very intellectual.  The typical Moravian student wears brands such as Forever 21, Mandee, Garage, Hollister, and Cotton On.  The social life is extremely limited, there are not many social events on campus, and the party scene is almost nonexistent."
College Freshman,2,The food options are extremely limited in the cafeteria.  If nothing appeals to you in the cafeteria then the Blue and Grey is an option but they do not allow students to create their own salads on the weekends.  The cafeteria hours are also limited.
College Freshman,2,I get rapey vibes when at parties and have heard of sexual assault stories that have happened this year.
College Freshman,2,The town of Bethlehem is pretty but there it gets boring after visiting it multiple times.
College Freshman,2,There are parties but most of them are pretty exclusive.  These few parties seemed fun in the beginning but as the year went on they became boring and repetitive.  I would not suggest this school to a student looking to enjoy their party experience at College.
College Junior,2,The tuition keeps rising and the amount of financial aid they give you keeps going down.
College Freshman,2,Campus housing is fairly bad. Freshman dorms stink. Upperclass housing is great.
College Junior,2,Minorities in race are very few and far between. Almost everyone is accepting of everyone based on race/sex/sexual orientation/ political beliefs etc. but again it is hard to find minorities.
College Freshman,2,There aren't many dining options close to campus. You would need to walk at least a mile in order to get to some of the restaurants.
College Freshman,2,"Not the best party scene. Since the school is so small the cops always know where the parties are, occasionally I think they let them slide. Usually when I get to the party, there isn't that many people there and there is more drinking than dancing. If you are looking for a good party, go to Lehigh. "
College Freshman,2,"There is hardly any diversity at this school at all. From what I heard it seems to be getting better each year, but there is more white people than anything. Most of the kids are higher upper class too. "
College Freshman,2,A parking permit is expensive but its not hard to access. 
College Sophomore,2,some are assholes some are cool
Senior,1,"Extremely disappointed with how they are handing planning and safety during COVID.  Communication is poor and they are not transparent with their plans. The emails to the college community come across as completely ignorant to the seriousness of this pandemic and the rising numbers that are occurring. For example, the sports conference cancelled the season because it was unsafe and the response was that they are going to have scrimmages anyway so the athletes can still play. That makes no sense. Not sure why the public health officials that encouraged the other Bethlehem college to close say Moravian can open. I feel like they think they're being different and have their stuff together more than other schools but it comes across as unorganized and irresponsible. I know this is a tough place for schools to be in but Moravian can do better."
Sophomore,1,"I was a student on campus last year. My online learning shift was very abrupt. Moravian had assured us that we would be able to stay in class and then switch the narrative to being able to stay on campus online, and then made us leave within a 24 hour notice. I was not able to get my things until JUNE. My professors loaded on busy work and did not know how to teach the same for online courses. My tests and essays were graded the same, if not harsher, even though we could not meet or study in person. Zoom is an uncomfortable thing, but especially when professors are calling out individual students. Moravian's control over the school closing is a major reason as to why I decided to transfer. You do not get any money back and the education is 1/10 of what it usually is online."
Sophomore,1,"This past year I was a student at Moravian College. It was truly one of the worst experiences and decisions I have ever made. Not only was I very familiar with the town, but I also attempted to become very involved, having two jobs and being apart of multiple clubs. The people at this institution are entitled, racist, homophobic, and frankly can be summed up as people who peaked in high school. The cliques on campus are unbelievable, and professors have clear favorites. The advisors are uninformed and the course selection process is difficult and confusing. The lure of the ""free"" laptop and ipad is a joke, and they take them back if you dont graduate. The dorms are hot and tiny, there is NO diversity, and the food is disgusting. Not worth the time or the money. The tour guides are paid minimum wage and told to tell lies to families. Almost everyone is conservative and judgy. The frats are rapey and police do nothing. Please reconsider before applying."
Alum,1,"I have had the worst experience at Moravian and wish that I never considered Moravian. My experience at Moravian has changed my family’s opinion and my opinion on Moravian. Moravian has shown their disrespect, racism, arrogance, and unprofessionalism during my time there."
Senior,1,"My experience was extremely poor. Two meetings stand out that explain my experience substantially well. In one meeting with my adviser, Camille Murphy, she belittled me and my life while talking over me for an hour as I cried. This is normally how meetings with her would go. Within that hour, she told me that I cannot be working and going to school at the same time even though I had all A's and B's along with bills to pay, that I will get nowhere in life, and I am a horrible graphic designer. After that, I met with the Assistant Provost, Carol Traupman-Carr. In that meeting, she also told me to work less to focus more on school which I explained that I was unable to with bills that I needed to pay. While I attended Moravian, all I did was go to school, do homework and work. I questioned why I should focus more on school while I had all A's and B's on my transcript. She then told me that a single A+ I had earned doesn’t count because my class was mostly Saudi Arabian students!"
Niche User,1,"Going here was the worst decision I had ever made. The best thing I did was transfer from this school after my freshman year (which was the longest process and a living nightmare). Their credits are completely different than any other university which makes it extremely difficult to transfer your credits. They lure you in with a computer and laptop that you have to return if you transfer even though you payed for part of the computer because they throw it into your tuition. The students there are awkard, weird, and snobby and there's absolutely NO diversity at Moravian. Once you pay up, the staff is NO help. The dorms are literally look like jail cells & no off campus housing, youre madated to live on campus or commute from home. There are only THREE places to eat at and they're all trash.  There's no life and the campus is always dead. Save your time & money & dont go here."
College Sophomore,1,"I've had a terrible experience here and have decided to withdraw due to the anxiety and depression caused by my time at Moravian. They draw students in with a ""free"" Macbook and iPad, both of which you pay at least double the price for! I am leaving this school penniless and depressed. Coming to Moravian was the worst decision I have ever made."
College Sophomore,1,There is nobody around at night which makes me very lonely.
College Sophomore,1,This college does not allow off-campus housing. The options are on-campus or off campus with parent/guardian.
College Freshman,1,The school is a decent size but the quality of people is low.  I would not attend this school again because I found it to be overpriced for the quality experience I was receiving.  My best experience at the school was transferring.
College Freshman,1,We do not have off campus housing
College Freshman,1,"The freshman dorms are disgusting and outdated and I am paying too much to be living in my dorm.  I have considered moving to a better suit down on the Hillside, but being the Hillside is completely isolated.  There is a bus that drives students to the hillside that comes every half hour but doing that on the weekend would make partying on the main campus close to impossible.  The bathroom and showers are also disgusting and not updated.  Overall, not only am I disappointed but so is my mother who is an alumni of the school."
College Junior,1,Its not available at our school so i wouldn't know
College Junior,1,We don't have off-campus housing at my school. All students are required to stay on campus or commute.
College Sophomore,1,not worth time or money. the only good thing is my sorority. i am transferring 
College Junior,1,"I would probably be happier at any other college than this one. Sorry, but my college experience shouldn't be purely academic. My biggest regret is not transferring after my first two weeks at this college."
College Junior,1,"Academic programs- If it weren't for my professors and the fact that classes are a breeze, I would have packed my bags. The academic program is the only thing keeping me at this school.

Social Scene- Absolutely dreadful if you aren't from PA. Even some PA kids end up transferring. We have like a 65% retention rate. Out of 1,700 students, only 1,000 live on campus, and are divided between campuses. There are 3 frats which throw parties, but after a while, you've been partying at the same place, doing the same thing, with the same people. Only sorority girls and freshmen tend to go to the parties. In addition to the 700 commuters, people tend to go home every weekend because they live about 30-45 min away. This is a terrible SUITCASE college, which they will lie about on tours. I highly suggest not coming here if you are not 30-45 min from campus. And everybody knows everybody's business, including things that bored people make up.

Campus Life- There are a lot of clubs on campus, but most have like 5-8 members. It's very cliquey and your friends at college are basically determined by the people you hang out with during the first two weeks of freshmen year. I joined a sorority soas to not go insane, which is what most people do."
College Junior,1,My home town was complete white bread and this school is white bread without the crust. I definitely wouldn't want to be a minority student here. I think there are 2 Asians total on this campus and maybe 30 (at best) black people. Everyone else is white. Majority are from PA and Jersey and are not very accepting of people from different areas. Almost everyone has highly conservative Republican ideals.
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid process was rough for both me and my parents.  It was hard for me to receive any financial aid because of my parents income.  My parents are in a very up and down employment.  My mom is a realtor which the real estate market has been at the lowest in many years.  My dad is a self contractor.  My parents operate by my mom selling my dad a cheap foreclosure and my dad would flip the house and try to sell for a profit.  The year that the financial aid was going off of for income was a year that my parents sold a ridiculous amount of houses, showing a huge capital gain, but since that year and the market still decreasing my parents are stuggeling to keep their jobs running."
College Student,1,while the police are always around and nothing is really stolen from dorms it feels like there is no real safety here. I've seen people beaten up and I've been threatened multiple times. I've even seen German and Nigerian exchange students threatened because they were foreign. Many people get away with violence here.

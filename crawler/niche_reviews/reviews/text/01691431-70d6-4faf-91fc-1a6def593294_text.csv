Niche User,5,"My son loves the small class sizes.  As a parent, I feel like he is safe and the teachers really care about my child succeeding!"
Sophomore,5,Adrian did a lot for students to get the access we needed when we switch to online for COVID-19. I was able to talk with my professors when and if I had a problem or did not understand the material. I was able to work on my own time and get all my work done.
Senior,5,"The college offers a lot of different ways of learning. Still, one thing I love the most is that Adrian makes sure every student will know enough that they will be well off in any averment they find themself in. Along with criminal justice, the course is the best so far. They make sure every student gets hands-on experience in each part of law enforcement, along with how law enforcement affects all walks of life."
Sophomore,5,What I liked about Adrian College is how safe the campus makes me feel. There is so much security and they are very kind. My car's battery died and I called the twice to jump start my car and they did it quickly and they were really nice about it. The professors are very helpful and are always kind when asking for help.
Freshman,5,I love it. It’s a small school that makes everyone feel welcome and important. You’ll never be forgotten or overlooked at Adrian. They are remodeling the last four buildings in campus within the next two years to have all new facilities. Whenever we have a complaint it is easy to get it resolved because we ca speak directly to the dean or president. It’s great to be able to have such a big voice.
Niche User,5,I visited adrian in early october and i absolutely loved it the campus was beautiful. The college facilty was amazing and they have very good sports programs there that are ranked in the nation.
Niche User,5,From the college adviser that visted my school from Adrian college changed my thinking about the college and gave me the thought about considering to apply and see if i get a chance on being accepted.But from what i heard and seen its a pretty school that has many opportunities for you to take advantage of while being their.Along with the support everyone gives you on making sure your doing good and enjoying every little bit of it to make sure your doing something your wanting.After all I've heard a good summary of this school.So from my point of view  nothing should be changed.Like everything is nice!!
Sophomore,5,"This school has changed my life. I absolutely love every aspect of the campus, the professors, the staff. Everyone is so friendly, and nothing but helpful. The price hurts your wallet but the benefits that you get from attending a school like this, you can never put a price on."
Freshman,5,i love this school the people here are nice and everyone's willing to take time out of there day to help you or ask hows your day going.
Niche User,5,I enjoyed the people there. I enjoyed the support of the people there and the facility. The coaches pushed me to be not only a better person but a better player. The school was super supportive in everything I did and I can't wait to attend there next fall again.
Graduate Student,5,My experience and visiting at Adrian College was amazing. At Adrian they had nice facilities and dorms. Also they have 40 different sports they have.
Freshman,5,"I have been at Adrian college for my first semester of college and honestly it has been one of the best times  of my life! While there, I felt this energy from other students that you can't find in high school, Adrian college felt more like a community than a college. Every student there helps one another, you'll never be alone either because you'll make so many friends while on campus. Now, if you are the type of person that likes to focus on your academics and don't like to socialize a lot, then you're out of luck because people here are so nice and kind. The food here is also really good, the staff there always makes sure there is different flavors everyday. I love this college and I hope I described my emotions in this essay to you."
Niche User,5,I love it! Its small and feels like home and i hope that i get to go there for college! Maddie my college adviser is an amazing person and such a sweetheart with a heart of gold.She tried to make me and my mom feel at home when we went to go check out the campus on one of their bulldog days.She is very intuitive and a great listener and if you text her she texts back immediately! Any one who wants a small college and a place to call home.Chose ADRIAN!!!!!!!!!!
Junior,5,"If you are looking for a small town with small class sizes and great academics, Adrian is the one for you. With the small class room sizes, you are able to not develop close relations to your peers, but your professors as well. A professor-student  relationship is crucial not only in the learning process, but even future academic adventures outside of Adrian. The professors are more than willing to sit down with you and break it down, piece by piece. You are not just another nameless face, you are you. Being a liberal arts college, distributions are a requirement. Though they may be an annoyance at first, they become well-rounded student shaping machines. Through these classes, you are able to educate your self of the other perceptions, cultures, and ideas along with the synthesis of your own. Though the social scene is somewhat lacking, Adrian College makes up for it in its application of the Arts and Sciences."
Niche User,5,It's a wonderful place full of wonderful people. they make you feel at home from day one.  There sports and academics are outstanding
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Adrian.  This college is blessed with amazing professors and staff in general. I fell in love with the campus as soon as I stepped foot on here. I enjoy that they have the Scholarship Day, which I got to meet with some of the staff that I will be working with in the future."
Freshman,5,It feels like coming home and being a part of a community that truly cares about the individual. Adrain has so many great opportunities for the students to learn about what the world is like and all of the experiences that you will need to be successful.
Freshman,5,Adrian college is a very well-developed college that has many opportunities for their students.  The teaching staff at Adrian College is very helpful and help their students strive to become their best.
Graduate Student,5,"Adrian College is a small liberal arts school in southern Michigan. The main campus sits on a one square mile block with additional buildings surrounding. Adrian College hosts over 40 sports teams participating in both NCAA DIII and Club. Adrian has a wide range of academic programs including business, athletic training, exercise science, sports management, and many more."
Junior,5,My experience at Adrian College is nothing like I would've expected. For this campus being a small school I expected it to be a very judgmental environment because everyone knows you and your business but everyone is very welcoming and nice. It is a home away from a home.
College Sophomore,5,The sports teams here are really close and their are a lot of them here. Each team is like a family and we all support each other which makes the campus a really great atmosphere.
College Sophomore,5,"Adrian College is surrounded with welcoming and motivated students. It may be small but everyone is connected which makes it a fun environment to go to school in. The academics are great and the teachers are very engaged and care about all of their students. I cannot see myself at any other college. There are always different activities going on such as one of my favorites, C.A.N. movie night in the student center. All together an amazing college to attend."
College Sophomore,5,Playing on the basketball team at Adrian College is great. All the sports get support from students and staff at school.
College Sophomore,5,My experience so far at adrian college is great.
College Sophomore,5,I love my school i plan on staying all 4 years.
College Sophomore,5,I enjoyed my room on campus I couldn't find any major problems about it.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Adrian College, it is mall and the professors i have had so far were excellent"
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus is something I would recommend no matter what school you go to. It allows you to become close with every student much more than if you had chosen to live off campus because when you live on campus you see people at every stage of the day and sometimes every stage of the night and that makes forming friendships and relationships so much easier and makes those relationships and friendships so much more valuable because you become so close to them that there is no judgement and you become so much closer tof them so much quicker it makes the bond you have with them so much more valuable.
College Sophomore,5,Each sport gives each person the opportunity to be a part of a community so much bigger than just our school. Our sports teams allow us to support each other throughout the school year because each weekend there is bound to be at least one team playing at home for you to go and watch. Each team does its part with the community in helping out with setting good examples for the kids in the community.
College Sophomore,5,"My school is one unlike any other. I would choose my school all over again if I had the chance for multiple reasons. It gives me the chance to be honest I want to be with no judgement whatsoever. I found people here that I will have in my life for the rest of my life and a place to call my home away from home. This school has presented me with so many opportunities that I wouldn't be able to find at another school whether it be athletic or academic, I know I will always have a reason to strive for success as long as I am at this school."
College Freshman,5,"I am a part of Chi Omega, one of the three sororities on campus and I believe that our Greek life on campus is one of the best organizations there is. Non-Greeks are all friends with greeks and I can speak for all of us Greeks, that we reach out to the non-greeks and take them under our wings. Greek life is a huge part of the campus atmosphere at Adrian College, and both Greek and non-Greeks will take great pride in admitting that is true."
College Freshman,5,"Campus safety is and will always be there for all of the students. When called, officers show up in a timely manner and are ready to help with whatever the situation is. I thank the campus safety officers as much as I possibly can because I know that they are working as hard as they can to ensure that we are all safe on campus. I feel 100% safe on campus 100% of the time, I am not worried to walk alone at night, because I know that campus safety has a strict surveillance of the grounds and will help me if I were to ever get into trouble."
College Freshman,5,I love our Greek life and most others love it too
College Sophomore,5,"Adrian College may not be the right school for you if you are sensitive to others. They refuse to silence anyone, which often leads to those who cannot argue their case being shut out by the community if the community believe they are in the wrong."
College Sophomore,5,"As the on air personality who has covered the most sports on campus out of anyone at Adrian College, I can confidently say our programs are incredible. One of the most successful schools in D3 sports!"
College Sophomore,5,"The school has two flaws, if you can look past these you will love Adrian College. The housing is trash (for the time being) and the food is terrible as well. If you can cope with these (and these are subjective opinions as well) then you will love Adrian College."
College Freshman,5,Our Greek life is like one big family and don't know what I would've done if I had not joined.
College Freshman,5,Our sports teams and faculties are expert and well known!
College Freshman,5,I love Adrian College and all it has to offer.
College Freshman,5,They make sure you are set for your future
College Freshman,5,"Love the greek life, joining next semester"
College Freshman,5,The sports teams here are very respected. i am apart of the bowling team and I love the respect and attention that we get. Its one big community.
College Freshman,5,"Absolutely love everything about this school. Great professors, great campus, great curriculum. I would not change a thing."
College Freshman,5,"Adrian College is a D3 school. Our best sport is hockey. We have 4 teams for men; D1 Black, D1 Gold, D3, and NCAA. For women there is NCAA and ACHA Ice hockey. We do have several other sports teams from football to synchronized ice skating. 400 of the 600 incoming 2015 freshmen were athletes and the numbers continue to grow. Sporting events are a major part of Adrian College."
College Freshman,5,"Athletics are great we have 4 guy hockey teams. One NCAA D3, one ACHA D1 and two ACHA D3 teams."
College Freshman,5,"I have always felt safe on campus no matter where I am. There isn't a whole lot of crime on campus, that I know of anyway. Campus Safety is also always around just in case something does happen and someone needs help."
College Freshman,5,"In my opinion, I think all of the courses here as taught by professors who really love what they teach and know. Sometime professors aren't the best at translating it for their students as well, but they still love what they do. Class size is very small and makes it for more teacher student interactions or one on one help."
College Freshman,5,A majority of the students here are involved in sports weather i's a varsity sport or just intramural. The community is also very supportive of our athletics. I think our athletes here are some of the best because of their work ethic and their own involvement in the community. Teams often go into the community for community service which builds a very good relationship between the students on campus and people of the community.
College Sophomore,5,I have never had an issue with safety or sexual assault.  I feel very safe on this campus.
College Freshman,5,They helped me with everything
College Freshman,5,Thr school revolves around all there sports teams
College Freshman,5,I feel safe everywhere i go on campus and we have a very good network of campus safety workers.
College Freshman,5,A degree from this school is looked upon very highly in many different fields.
College Freshman,5,Adrian College is a exceptional college. At Adrian you get to make decisions that effect the whole campus as a whole and you get to lead and create relationships with your professors. Office hours are made available and are encouraged. I would recommend this college to anyone looking to grow and learn in  small nit community.
College Freshman,5,I decided to join a fraternity and i enjoy it a lot. Due to my fraternity i am a big park of campus activities.
College Freshman,5,"I really enjoy everything about Adrian College. Here at Adrian I am more then just a number and I am highly involved in things that happen around campus. I get to make great connections with my professors who are all experts in their fields of study. My decision to go to Adrian has been one of the best I have ever made. I would strongly recommend this school to anyone looking to learn, grow and be involved during their college career."
College Freshman,5,"I love attending Adrian College. There is always people to help me if/when I need it. Plus I have one on one time with my professors, which I love getting to know them. Then the campus life itself is amazing. There is always somewhere to go to hang out with friends or just go by yourself. I am not afraid of the campus at night, which is good since I am a night person."
College Sophomore,5,I would absolutely choose Adrian College again. I've found a home here and I wouldn't give it up for anything.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Adrian College. The facilities are state of the art, the campus is beautiful, and the friends and memories I have made are great. Education is of course important, and I have found a lot of success at Adrian College so far, but I believe that there are other important factors such as student activities, athletics, and friends that help make college a wonderful experience and Adrian College has done that for me."
College Sophomore,5,I play soccer and love it there
Alum,4,I did not take classes online until March of 2020 when the COVID pandemic forced the school to convert to a completely online format. Professors generally did an amazing job switching to an online format. Most professors were very organized in their online format and made the transition smooth.
Alum,4,My experience was good. The staff are friendly and the institute provides a quality education. Their mental health services are lacking and they recently began outsourcing their counseling services.
Sophomore,4,"Adrian has a lot to offer for their students; with the ability to have access to teachers in their off hours, the Ice Rink for students to skate on, the gym, and a wonderful library perfect for studying or doing homework."
Senior,4,The college gives a warm and good feeling all around the school in the classes are top of the line for being a small college.
Freshman,4,The atmosphere of Adrian College is very alive and welcoming for a small school. The campus is beautiful and well kept and the students and staff there are always there to show the way.
Freshman,4,"Adrian is a very close knit community. When I visited, the professors and students were ready and willing to help me, and seemed very passionate about their school."
Freshman,4,"I haven't been a student here for long, but so far there are a lot of things that you can do, many clubs to join, and all around fun. The teachers are all great."
Sophomore,4,"I have had a blast at Adrian College so far! There isn't much more that I could ask for in a college. The people here are kind, outgoing, and friendly. Because of the size, you can have more interactions with teachers, and you can't go anywhere without recognizing someone. The school is all about making sure that it's students are getting what they need and everyone wants you to succeed. My only wish is that there was a sustainable agriculture program--or any ag program for that matter."
Sophomore,4,"I love this school. This college has allowed me to grow into the adult I am today. I have a real relationship with my professors and mentors. The administration cares about growing students into functioning members of society. 
There is very high envolvment from student in clubs and sports. The small school atmosphere is everything I ever hoped it would be. My biggest problem is with the food. Food options are poor at best."
Sophomore,4,"Adrian College is very small, which give the students to know their professors at a unique level. Class sizes are small, usually around 30 people. This gives students a prime opportunity to find research options and get recommendation letters from their professors."
Freshman,4,I really like the fact that both the campus and class sizes are relatively small. It gives me the opportunity to get to know my professors and reach out for help when I need it.
Niche User,4,"As far as I know Adrian College is a very good school to attend, it has good teachers and staff, a good environment, and lots of options open to you.  I know they have a good teaching program and child development program.  I hear they have a pretty good sports program and open to recruiting kids for different sports."
Niche User,4,the bowling team is a very good team to be on. the school is very nice inside and out. very nice people around the campus. campus have a lot of resources. teachers are very nice to students. ready to work a student job on campus.
Freshman,4,"All-inclusive and the staff is amazing! If you want to work up to your goals, everyone is there to encourage you. The campus is beautiful and everyone has so many opportunities, no matter their background."
Alum,4,Adrian College focuses heavily on athletics so if you're wanting to play a sport this is the place for you. The campus is beautiful and very well taken care. The professors are always willing to help one-on-one and you will build wonderful relationships with them as mentors. Most of the buildings and dorms need renovated but these are being done on a cycle if you can stand a couple months of being less than comfortable from no AC in some of the dorms then you'll be just fine.
Junior,4,"Adrian College has a wonderful, friendly campus with amazing facility. Professors who go out of their way to help you achieve the best.  I would love to see the housing become more updated in the future or tuition lowered. although adrian costs a lot  they do have many things to offer if you look into it."
Alum,4,Adrian is perfect if you’re looking to successfully juggle academics and sports. I played volleyball there at it was a great experience and I was still able to graduate with honors.
Sophomore,4,The faculty of Adrian is what really sets us apart from other schools. We have a great staff of professors that really want you to succeed.
Freshman,4,Overall my experience with Adrian College has been a good one. I am currently half way through my second semester as a freshmen.  The campus is extremely beautiful and they take pride in keeping it this way. The professors are some of the best and care about what they are teaching and there are a wide variety of classes to choose from. Adrian has multiple athletics taking place year round. There are also plenty of activities or different clubs to get involved with on campus.
Freshman,4,"This is a great school. It's beautiful, small, and has some amazing people.  There is a small staff to student ratio, so you'll definitely be able to have one on one help from your professors.  Something that could be improved is the safety of the campus, as it's typical to have a break-in."
College Sophomore,4,Adrian College  is great. It helps to be on a sports team and just have a go to group whenever you need something. Being on a team creates a special bond. Also the school is a perfect size it is small but it allows us students to really be involved with school and with our professors and on campus activities.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus safety on campus great. They are always available in someone needs something, they are also well aware of everything that is going around campus and aren't afraid to step in when something isn't going the way it is supposed to."
College Sophomore,4,"Adrian College had an excellent program for athletic training. They introduced a program that is called a ""four plus one"" which allows students to complete their bachelors degree in the normal four years and then proceed to get their masters degree here at the college in one year. Since it is a smaller school it allows the students to get closer with the staff and really get that one on one aspect."
College Junior,4,"Most the professors care about what they are teaching and teach it well. I wish there was a better variety of courses offered but recently the school has been doing a decent job adding more classes. I love the small class size, where even in a lecture hall you only have 30 people in your class."
College Junior,4,Greek life at my school is awesome. Every fraternity and sorority sincerely cares about their philanthropy. There is a wide variety of different qualities about each fraternity and sorority that makes choosing the right one for you easier. I think non-Greeks are treated the same as greeks and are encouraged to join greek life by greeks. There is limited greek housing and several sororities were kicked out of there designated dorm hall and given a small house instead that can only hold a fraction of the members. The local sorority on campus is also a great sorority for those who want to be apart of Greek life but cant afford national sororities. The national sororities on campus seem to look down on the local sorority though and tend not to include them in important greek decisions.
College Junior,4,"The school is very small and easy to navigate around. I am glad I went to such a small college because it better fits my personality and helps college be less stressful. Although having a small campus is nice, the fact that they have limited housing options that are overflowing and a policy that makes you live on campus for 4-years is aggravating. The college did not do a good job expressing this policy and I was not aware of it until I was already halfway though my first year. I wish I had known before I had chosen to go there."
College Sophomore,4,Adrian is  A great school to graduate from and is very prestigious
College Sophomore,4,I haven't heard of anyone being sexually assaulted on campus
College Sophomore,4,I am on the varsity football team at Adrian college and i consider everyone on the team as my brother.
College Sophomore,4,Student networking is something that is very promoted at my school. If a professor thinks they have a student who is worthy of being recommended to somebody whether it is outside of school or in school they will recommend you. The school does its absolute best to set you on your career path once you graduate.
College Sophomore,4,My classes are mostly on the small side except for lectures but that is exactly how I like it. For the most part my professors are very approachable and willing to help just about anybody who is willing to take it.
College Sophomore,4,Our security guards drive around campus throughout the night and at times go into the building a to check and make sure nothing is going on. We have to scan our id's to be able to get into most of the dorm buildings this way not just anybody can walk right in. Any dorms that do not have the id scan to get in have a key to the building to get in instead. There are security cameras in every building to keep an eye on things throughout the day and night to make sure nothing is going on that shouldn't be.
College Sophomore,4,I am not involved in Greek life at my school so I don't know very much about it but from what I have seen it is very coexistence with the rest of the school community and unless you see somebody at a party a lot of time you don't realize the people that are actually in Greek life.
College Freshman,4,"The Athletics on campus are HUGE there is a joke around campus that if you are not a student athlete, you must be a Greek. Almost every student that I know is an athlete in some way or another. Our student body supports each and every team as if they were a part of it. The facilities for our athletics are amazing and modern. We have a fantastic football field, hockey/ice skating arena, and softball/baseball complex. I am not a student athlete but I still attend as many games and matches as possible because I love the crowd's atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,"Adrian College focuses on the students and treats them as human beings, not just a number. The career development office is ALWAYS sending out new opportunities to the students. The faculty makes sure that you are succeeding in your classes and are more than willing to help you search for a job and or internship. Many of our graduates have a job in the real world before they graduate, so that they are ready to be out of the college world."
College Junior,4,They are always working to improve the safety on campus.
College Junior,4,"Everyone is involved in sports, though  there are not much student involvement at the sporting events, that is something that I would like to see change. There is a high pride of school spirit. The athletic facilities are top of the line are all brand new."
College Junior,4,"Adrian college is so small, it gives you chances to get involved on campus and in the community so you can start networking and getting your name out there and get opportunities to add to your resume. I would choose it again, its helped shape my career goals."
College Sophomore,4,Some professors are amazing while others that conduct labs don't take the time to actually teach the students the lab. They would rather do the lab themselves instead of allowing the students to learn by doing the lab themselves.
College Sophomore,4,The counseling services will help to find either graduate schools or careers for the students.
College Sophomore,4,The facilities are great for athletes and students. They are also great for the visiting teams.
College Sophomore,4,The small class sizes are very beneficial to the students.
College Freshman,4,Maters in 5 years is worth it
College Freshman,4,I've never had a problem
College Freshman,4,We're  a d3 school
College Sophomore,4,I would say this is a pretty safe place to drink or abuse substances.
College Sophomore,4,"On campus ""safety"" (police) and the local police as well as the surrounding neighborhood, leads to students leaving their doors and cars unlocked on campus!"
College Sophomore,4,"You have to create your own career prospects, but the value of a degree from this school is every cent you can afford. It's incredible how respected the school is."
College Freshman,4,The dorms are small but great quality.
College Freshman,4,They are redoing lots of buildings which is good
College Freshman,4,Campus safety does a great job at helping students when it's needed from smoke alarms in hall basements to walking students around campus if they don't feel safe by themselves.
College Freshman,4,"The professors care very much about how you are doing in their classes and always make it known that they are available for help. They have weekly office hours and are often willing to meet one on one outside of class, even weekends. You defiantly get what you pay for."
College Freshman,4,"The school is always sending out notifications on new internships that are available for all majors. the school also had a new program where if you don't make a certain amount after a year of graduation, they will start paying off student loans. if you don't get a job at all, they pay off all  loans."
College Freshman,4,"I personally love living in the dorms. I have made so many friends with the people that live on my floor and in the building. Hall programs are a great way to get to know your RA's and other residents while having fun and earning free pizza and prizes. The rooms are a good size for two people, the bathrooms could use a little help but it's not horrible."
College Freshman,4,"The class sizes are small, 30 students max. We do not have Teaching Assistants, professors teach the classes and are more than willing to meet with students when needed or requested. Athletics play a large part in my school, this provides many opportunities to get out and meet people. The school is very nice, buildings are up to date and renovated, staff is generous and understanding, and the students are welcoming and open minded. I enjoy the fact that it is a Christian school and provides weekly services and an on campus minister. The class and major selection is wide. We have majors from foreign languages to event planning. If I had to go back and choose again I would still choose the school I am at, they have helped me grow, not only educationally, but as a person. During welcome week they separated us into groups with new people and helped us sign up for classes, move in to our dorms, go to activities on campus, help familiarize us with the campus, and so much more. I am truly happy with my decision on attending Adrian College."
College Freshman,4,Safety on campus is really good and I have no worries
College Freshman,4,Professors are willing to help students in anyway possible.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is good to the community and loves their school.
College Freshman,4,Its really fun learning and traveling around the state playing hockey.
College Freshman,4,A lot of people are involved in Greek organizations
Niche User,2,"Adrian college destroyed my freshman college experience, as a student and an athlete. It also wasn't very diverse."
Junior,2,The food services are fairly poor and not healthy at all. The higher-ups tend to not care about stuendts opinions and spend money on useless things.
Junior,2,"Good because of the small school size, but they take you for every penny you have and don't make it easy on international students."
College Junior,2,Most of the students drink constrand even drink before coming to class.
College Sophomore,2,The bathrooms are horrendous and the hallways are not monitored properly. Vandalism happens and the correct students are not dealt with accordingly. There is also drunkenness at all hours through the halls.
College Freshman,2,They dropped my program right away
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of enforcement. Very visible
College Freshman,2,No rules enforce. Safety called a lot
College Freshman,2,Dropped my program right away.
College Freshman,2,"The staff is all very helpful and will do a lot for you, but the academics aren't great and the food sucks. All the sports teams seem to have bad coaches who don't know what they're doing."
College Sophomore,2,The school doesn't allow off-campus housing without a lot of trouble.
College Sophomore,2,"The room available for each dorm room is atrocious. I have no clue how two people are supposed to live in some of these rooms. In addition, the rooms are falling apart. Wall paper is coming off the walls, their are strange stains on the floor and furniture, and the bathrooms need to be updated."
College Freshman,2,It's way too hard and complicated to get approved for off campus anyway
College Freshman,2,"Our dorms are practically falling apart, quite literally. The showers suck, the water fountains suck. The atmosphere is pretty decent, RAs are really cool about everything though. It's super great being so close to all the academic buildings and cafeteria and student center and library. The kitchens in the dorms are crazy outdated, as well as the bathrooms. Paint chips everywhere. The furniture is literally the same from thirty years ago."
College Sophomore,2,The food at the cafeteria if very calorie rich and there are not many healthy options.
College Sophomore,2,"I currently live in a 12' by 21' dorm room with my roommate, things are cramped."
College Freshman,2,"There's not much in the City of Adrian, it's quite small."
College Junior,2,The school is sneaky when it comes to disbursing your financial aid
College Freshman,2,I think that it is completely idiotic that the college will not allow students to live off of campus. The campus housing is overpriced for the terrible selections.
College Freshman,2,The weather is always windy and this year there was way more snow than normal. I was not too happy about either of these facts.
College Freshman,2,The school will try to get out of paying you the proper financial if they can so it is important to always read the financial aid statements. Another important thing to do is meet with your financial aid adviser face to face. Emails typically do not work and the adviser is more likely to disregard your problem if contact is being made via email.
College Junior,2,"It is windy most of the year, no matter the other weather elements. There is typical Michigan weather: hot summers and cold winters."
College Freshman,2,"They are not very helpful with financial aid, this college is very expensive and I understand but I feel there could be more scholarships and opportunities for students."
College Freshman,2,"Freshman dorms are small, no a/c"
College Sophomore,2,"Its a rare student that is not involved in Greek life, so when you're not, you feel like they completely take over the campus."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a few decent restaurants, but most places are coneys, fast food, etc."
College Freshman,2,"Teachers at Adrian College, specifically one music teacher, does not know how to appreciate a students skill and talent. "
College Freshman,2,"It is expense to attend Adrian College, for me it is hard to get around to local places, the weather is causing issues, the people (some teachers) don't appreciate their students skills and talents, and I don't get a challenge in any of my classes."
College Freshman,2,"There's not much to do, the people are nice if thats a plus"
College Sophomore,2,"The closest thing you could call a ""club"" is the LA Cafe, which is more of a bar with a dance floor. It can be fun if you're in the right mood for it."
College Sophomore,2,"Generally, the AC student population is pretty homogeneous. "
College Sophomore,2,There's a fraternity or sorority to fit just about everybody.
College Sophomore,2,There are many alcoholics in the making at Adrian College.
College Sophomore,2,Lots and lots of athletes in the bunch. Other characteristics are pretty average across the board.
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is generally pretty safe, but walking alone at night has proven to be dangerous to some of the students."
College Sophomore,2,"Not great, not awful. It would be nice to have more on-campus dining options."
College Sophomore,2,"School computer labs, like those in the student center and the library, work just fine, but the wireless internet leaves a lot to be desired."
College Sophomore,2,not much of a night life
College Sophomore,2,Terrible. Adrian is pretty much middle of nowhere in farm country. 10 minutes any direction away from campus you will see a long field of crops
College Sophomore,2,A lot of kids do drugs and drink on campus. More than 70% of students.
Niche User,1,"Do not be fooled! This IS NOT a Christian university. They may 'sell' it to you that way, but it is far, far from the reality of campus life. There is no effort by any staff, coach, professor that cares about the spiritual nature of it's students. Partying is the main activity past sports, an atheist teaches religion and is not respectful to those who speak of God, and it is not neccessarily a safe place for women. If you are looking for a place to grow and be supported in faith...look elsewhere. Notice in this search that Olivet (MI), Alma, etc are included and are very much NOT Christian either. Being founded by a denomination means nothing about the spiritual strength or weakness of a school."
College Sophomore,1,"It stands a chance to be better if they get rid of the joke of a ""housing director"" Adrian College currently employs."
College Freshman,1,"There's not much help from the financial aid office, even when you've exhausted all of the work you could do outside of the school. Search for aid outside of the school before turning to the school for help, and keep records of all of your work."
College Junior,1,"There are only a few labs on campus and they are usually full, broken, or dirty. Wireless connections are only strong in places where administrators work. Multiple dorms have horrible wireless connections and the server goes down multiple times a month."
College Junior,1,"There are no limitations on who can bring a car to campus, so many people do. There seems to never be a spot in the hall parking lots."
College Freshman,1,"The girls here start rumors, that call each other blasphemous names, they are stuck-up, arrogant, and disgusting. "
College Freshman,1,"I live in St. Louis, Missouri. Adrian is smaller than the city that I live in. Adding to that, Adrian is so small that they town doesn't have shuttles, buses, or an airport. I also do not own any means of transportation. So, when it comes to small three day breaks, I stay on campus when everything on school grounds is closed, including places where I can buy food. When I need to go home, I either get a ride from Campus Safety to drive me up to Ann Arbor to take the GreyHound or Amtrak home, or my father comes from St. Louis to pick me up in Adrian. That in itself is already expense and a hassle. I go on for months without seeing my family, including my twin sister, when everyone else that I know of in Adrian sees their families on a weekly basis. It gets tough sometimes, but I really wish that Adrian College provided ways for students like me t ogo to places in the town, so that we don't have to starve every weekend. "
College Freshman,1,"The snow in Adrian hinders many students from getting to class on time, it hinders students from buying groceries when they drive to the nearest Wal-Mart which is almost four miles away from the school. The classes still go on, but the weather keep many from doing what needs to be done. "
College Sophomore,1,"Just get an apartment off-campus, if you can. The housing is either really overpriced or really cramped."
College Junior,1,"The food on campus is a very low quality, they also have a very small variety at the school. The dining hall is only open until 8:00 pm so you can not have a later dinner. Sometimes the food is  cold, and just not good."
College Junior,1,"The computers have the right programs that students need, but there is very few of them, and most of the places with computers are locked at about 8:00 pm. The wireless connection is almost non-existent on the entire campus. The printers always break down as well. A lot of times the wired connection doesnt even work."
College Junior,1,"There is nothing to really do in the city of Adrian to begin with. There are only two bars in the town, and only one club, but it is very small. There aren;t many parties on campus at all."
College Senior,1,"Very few bars are available by campus, but campus is not too far from big cities. If you are going out near campus, safety is available to drive on designated nights, but if you go to the city you need to find a designated driver."
College Senior,1,constantly having to move where you park for sporting events when you already bought a 200 parking pass
College Sophomore,1,"Severe Is a Bit of an Understatement – The campus safety is very strict when it comes to underage drinking on campus. They are constantly breaking up parties and writing up students. First-time offenders have a letter sent home, plus a note on your file. If an individual gets repeated offensive he or she can be kicked out of the college. My best advice is to do anything considered a violation indoors and be quiet about it. Do not be obnoxious, because you will get caught!"
College Sophomore,1,"The Nightlife is a bit limited at Adrian College, in terms of options. On Thursdays you can dance the night away at the local club, L.A. Cafe. For the remainder of the weekend students are pretty limited to attending a party in one of the on-campus apartments or houses. However, even this can be limited further, because in order to attend a party you have to know the hosts, and within a short amount of time the campus safety usually puts an end to the party. Nightlife is a bit of a failure at Adrian College, which drives many students to leave school on the weekends."
College Freshman,1,"I have run into numerous issues dealing with the Financial Aid and Businesses Offices just in my first few months on campus. There were a handful of issues trying to get all of the necessarily information to them dealing with my loans. After having faxed the papers to them numerous times, they still claimed to have never received them and charged me two late fees on my account. They are  sometimes very rude when dealing with students and don't take them very seriously. Payroll and the Cashier's office also have given me problems. I do Work Study on campus to accumulate an income and there have been times where my paychecks are messed up, something goes wrong in the computer, and they put holds on money for two, sometimes three, weeks at a time.I love everything about Adrian College and have been more than please with everything they have to offer EXCEPT how they deal with finance on campus. I have had a very unsuccessful experience when dealing with them, but I know that due to unreliability, it probably won't be the last time I have to deal with them."
Recent Alumnus,1,"4-Year Requirement – 4-year live on campus requirement.
It's very difficult to appeal to live off campus.
Dorms are extremely crowded."
College Junior,1,"Where to Park? Our campus allows freshmen to have a car. I found this very helpful my first year but finding a parking spot was a nightmare. Two of the parking lots close frequently for campus events and you don't find out until the day of so it's easy to get a ticket. The city of Adrian doesn't allow you to park your car on the street between the hours of 3 and 6 am. However, if you can't find parking, a ticket from the city is cheaper than a ticket from the college. The city charges $15 the college charges $25."

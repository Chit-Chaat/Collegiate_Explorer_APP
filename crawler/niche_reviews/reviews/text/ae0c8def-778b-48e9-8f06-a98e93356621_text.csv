Freshman,5,"I really enjoy attending SWIC, since I grew up in a small town where everyone knows everyone else this was an easy transition for me since I still live at home, and although it's bigger than my high school it is still easy to find my way around. Since I am only a freshman, I don't know much of the staff, but the teachers I have had the pleasure of interacting with are amazing and have made my first year excellent. I also feel very safe on campus, I'm not sure how it is at other colleges, but at SWIC there are cops always walking around, and for me at least that shows that the school really does care about the well being of its students. I do wish there were more activities for the students to do, but I do understand that those cannot happen right now due to the pandemic."
Sophomore,5,"Most Instructors are to the point and provide many additional information opportunities. During the recent shutdown, technology was implemented to assist in success."
Sophomore,5,Online classes. Become intuitive with the assistance of Professors. It was easy to stay ahead and time was given to meet all goals.
Sophomore,5,"I really appreciate SWIC. It instilled in me the passion to want to learn more and pursue a Bachelor's Degree... I may even go on to graduate school. My professors were amazing at their jobs and taught with passion. Shout out to Mr. Arnold, Dr. Hunter, Mr. Shannon, Mr. Zeigler, Mrs. Nagel, Mr. Monroe, Dr. Cherry, Mrs. Presson, Mr. Bilyeu, and Mrs. Branlund. They really made learning fun and enjoyable. Anyone who says SWIC professors don't care hasn't taken either of these professors. SWIC is also in a nice location. I will say some of the advisors could be more helpful but Mrs. Keisha was always happy to help me with my schedules. I would advise taking classes two days a week as that helped me out a lot and also check your professors out on ratemyprofessor before choosing them. Good luck!"
Freshman,5,"SWIC is a beautiful campus with people of all ages and backgrounds. It is near the air force base, so it sees lots of people coming past and through it. It is a very safe campus, with its own police force on site. The professors aren't terrible, and the classes offer the perfect amount of an academic challenge for students."
Freshman,5,"Although this is a community college, it is the best affordable education in the area. The professors and staff show genuine care for your education and are willing to work with you, not against you."
Alum,5,SouthWestern Illinois College was the best college I went to.  They give you opportunities to get involved in anything you want to.  The campus was friendly and I didn't have any problems there.  This college is just like any other college or universities and I am so glad I attended swic.
Niche User,5,I love Southwestern Illinois College. I got a job in my field right away. I frequently go back to update skills.
Sophomore,5,"Great campus, small, community feel, faculty is a little hit or miss, but overall a good school. Just finished my first year."
Freshman,5,"I'm in the Aviation Program at Southwestern Illinois College, the campus is clean the new building the liberal arts building is newest of the 3 buildings and is also where i had 90% of my classes. Allround it's a nice compass and also has easy classes."
Sophomore,5,Southwestern Illinois College is a great place to further your education while saving money at the same time. The education that you get will be valuable and and more than pay off the cost in the long run.
Freshman,5,I am currently in my second semester of my freshman year at SWIC. My experience has been great so far. All of my professors have been wonderful and have been really committed to helping each student succeed. I have met so many different and wonderful people.
Sophomore,5,"I'm completing some prerequisite math courses at SWIC and absolutely love the teaching styles of the Mathematics Team.  The Professors have office hours and allow drop-in visits to review class instruction/problem solving.  Additionally, SWIC has a wonderful Success Center employed with student and alum tutors."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is very small which is nice because you get to know your teachers on a personal level, and all of my professors have been very helpful and strive to see their students succeed."
Sophomore,5,"The college is like the show 901250. I like how the campus is small and well maintained. The students like to help each other out if one is struggling in the class. The success center is amazing the people there are friendly and are always willing to help, just do not forget to sign in. The food on the cafe is okay there are some options but not many, but there is fast food across the street. Just try not to park by the metro link due to some issues people have had, but overall it is amazing here for a community college."
Sophomore,5,I really have enjoyed my experience at Southwestern Illinois College. The people are fairly nice and respectful. The staff is friendly and helpful. Overall this school is a great place to start off at and it’s affordable.
Sophomore,5,I like how much cheaper the classes are than a university. The nursing program is hard to get into but its a really good program.
Sophomore,5,"I honestly love this place.  I know at first it seems like ""Oh it's just a community college there's never anything big happening there so why should I rate it five stars?"" That's not the case at all.  This community college is the most outgoing, loving college I've ever been on campus to.  There are so many activities and when you walk around outside on campus you interact with so many different people, it's like they're family."
Niche User,5,"It was pretty easy to register and enroll in classes. It is conveniently right next to the highway, and the outskirts of the town. I am pretty excited to attend in the fall."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved SWIC, my time here has not been wasted. Most of the professors are great, they know how to do their job well.  I have saved a ton of money going to school here!"
Freshman,5,Great value!  Starting at SWIC helped me save money while figuring out what I wanted to do.  I am able to work part-time to help offset costs and complete my studies at the same time.  I have been able to take my time and figure out what I really want for my future.
Freshman,5,"Overall, Southwestern Illinois College is an awesome place to complete your first 2 years of colleges. The classes are a lot cheaper than a lot of the bigger universities but you'll be missing out on some of the fun things a nicer bigger campus."
Freshman,5,Everybody at SWIC are very cooperative and helpful. I had a very pleasant experience with the Credit Transfer department. The lady who worked my case was extremely helpful and did everything in her power to support my case in front of the Mathematics Department and I was awarded the credits I had applied for.
Works Here,5,"Great, affordable college for a two year degree. Staff is friendly and helpful. Seated in the heart of Belleville, Illinois with the metro-link nearby to take you to St. Louis and surrounding communities. Great campus offering a wide variety of classes to start you on your college career."
Freshman,5,I am just starting out at SWIC and I am loving how helpful everyone is. The financial aid office is very helpful and they help you fill out your forms for aid.
College Junior,5,Just began school a week ago
Recent Alumnus,5,"As I've said previously, I believe that all universities should model the community college...especially SWIC.  They have it all dialed in as to what works and what doesn't.  They are entirely about helping each student succeed."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I have had many online classes and the experience is almost like being in the physical classroom.  You have to put the time in to complete each course.  They are set up on weekly schedules with due dates each week (for the most part, depending on the specific course), and if you don't follow those guidelines then you hurt yourself.  I have enjoyed each online class and feel as though the instructors were right there with any help or questions that I had/needed."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The faculty at SWIC is there to help.  I have never had a negative experience with anyone that I've personally had contact with.  If you open yourself up and speak openly and honestly, the faculty will reciprocate that to you."
Recent Alumnus,5,Every career aspect is based on the individual.  Having a Harvard education and severely lacking work ethic isn't going to get you anywhere.  I believe that the individual dictates their future and their willingness to thrive.  I do not believe that having SWIC on your degree hinders you in anyway if you prove yourself worthy of the position you hold.
Recent Alumnus,5,As I said previously the student to teacher ratios offer a more individualized experience.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The student to teacher ratio is wonderful.  It allows for a more personable experience and one that is able to cater to individual student needs.  There is also almost limitless assistance offered if the student is still struggling.  The professors are always available and willing to help each person succeed to their highest potential...with the added benefit of making lasting impressions and actually getting to know your professor and they you -you don't feel like a number, but a person."
Recent Alumnus,5,"If SWIC was a 4-year university I would continue there for my B.S.  As a nontraditional student (working married, mother of two) I need flexibility in my schedule and SWIC offered that.  I am finding that it is virtually impossible to find a university that offers the programs that I need at times that are convenient or even plausible for a working individual, let alone a mother.  I believe that universities should take note of the efficient functionality of the community colleges and mirror them.  Our society is constantly changing its' needs and I believe that the community college's have kept up with those needs while universities are stuck in an old mindset and need to come to terms."
College Junior,5,"I'm in my first semester at Southwestern Illinois College (Belleville Campus), and I've had a great experience so far. Great professors, challenging classes, and an easy commute."
College Junior,5,"Thanks to the opportunity to receive a job at the school, I got my first job as a secretary in the school's academic advising and counseling office.  My supervisor interviewed me and saw through my nervous smile and into all of my great qualities and characteristics that qualified me for the job.  Thanks to this opportunity, I will be better-prepared to pay for my classes.  Without this school, I would likely still be unemployed."
College Junior,5,"I achieved outstanding grades and received my first job.  I made a variety of friends in the first semester, which also helped my social life.  I haven't been this happy in years, especially because of my rough middle school and high school experiences."
College Senior,5,The classes are really flexible. I have a full time job and i mostly go to school at night. They are many night class and the professor will work with you knowing you have a full time job.
College Senior,5,The carerr center at swic is the best. They will answer and questions you have.
College Senior,5,"While attending Southwestern Illinois College, I have participated in clubs and activities. Although students are gone mostly during the afternoon, the atmosphere on campus is very lively and there is usually something fun happening quite frequently. The academic advisers treat you very nicely and actually do their job to the fullest, in comparison to other colleges who make the students do most of the work."
College Junior,5,"I haven't started classes yet, but while registering for classes everyone was so helpful."
College Senior,5,They are great with people who need help
College Senior,5,I was taking my basic study the work lode was very have at time and time consuming but there nothing I would change that but I am planning to go back to the program that I want to do
College Sophomore,5,I Iearned a lot more at a lower price than most technical schools
College Senior,5,I'm on the baseball team so the athletics is very important
College Senior,5,Flexible around college baseball travel
College Junior,5,The professors are good. There are many different types of classes to take during SWIC.
College Junior,5,I take the classes I need to get my degree
College Junior,5,They apply tuition in a timely manner.
College Junior,5,Success Center is free and Library is good.
Recent Alumnus,5,LOVE MY EXPERIENCE AT SWIC !!!
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love my estorm account. Once I picked my degree, it displayed all the classes that would fulfill the requirements so I won't be wasting my time with things I do not need."
Recent Alumnus,5,The online courses are great. The conversations among the diverse group of students is sometimes better than within the classroom setting.
Recent Alumnus,5,I love that everyone is accepted and that there's a club for every entity--no matter what the orientation.
Recent Alumnus,5,"At SWIC, everyone has a place. They embraces all. It is really cool."
Recent Alumnus,5,I can honestly say I am comfortable with the curriculum and each professor I have had to date. The are so approachable and helpful. They really realize that we (the students) are there to receive an education. The curriculum is rigorous but definitely helpful.
Recent Alumnus,5,My major is education. Every professor has their Master's and better. They really focus on preparing you for a real life classroom experience along with providing the State Standards.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Libraries, student center, athletic options, financial counselors, transfer fairs, etc.... if you can name it --SWIC has it!"
Recent Alumnus,5,There are computer labs and cafes in every building.
College Junior,5,"One of the best things about my school is how affordable it is. I am currently on scholarship, but the cheap tuition is what allows for so many students to attend."
College Senior,5,In the cyber lounge are plenty of computers. I work on the computer quickly do to great internet service. Printing is no problem at all.
Freshman,4,"All of the classes I have taken this semester have been a hyflex model, meaning I do half at home and half in person. I actually enjoy this method more, for one thing I save on gas money because I don't have to go to campus as often, and two because I feel like I have more time to do the assignments when I am at home. However, there are down sides to this method, because there are days were I don't feel like paying attention and since I don't have to have my camera on, it can become very easy to not pay attention, there has also been a couple days where my internet would shut down, and I would have to log back into class before I missed to much of the material."
Sophomore,4,"It has a good range of classes and activities, the tuition is reasonable and cheaper than others around the area. Any changed I would say would want to be made would be better online integration."
Alum,4,"When COVID forced us to shut down campus and move online, the majority of my professors did a really good job at adapting the class. They were still easy to contact and were very understanding of the stressful situation."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed every single class I took. Professors were understanding, students were friendly. The Music Department and Film Department are absolutely amazing - I learned so much being in choir and making movies. There are so many good places to study on campus and its just across the street from several restaurants. The only thing that let me down was the Theatre Department. I did not feel very supported by those professors at all, which was really unfortunate. But overall, I loved my time there. I'm so happy to have gone there, met so many great people, and had such amazing classes."
Niche User,4,"This school has been great working with me as a high school student and has given me a major boost in my academic career. I have had nothing but a great experience in my classes, and everyone I have interacted with on campus was friendly and very professional."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed all of my experiences at Southwestern Illinois College. The professors actually care about students and their ability to learn in the given environment.
Sophomore,4,"If you're looking for a solid, cheap start to your college career and you don't want to get tied up paying for an expensive 4-year university in Illinois, SWIC is a great place to get your footing."
Sophomore,4,"To be honest, I'm a student at SWIC because I didn't do the best in high school and didn't apply to any other college. For what it is, SWIC is a fine institution with good resources to transfer to a good 4-year college or university or enter the workforce after earning an AAS or certificate. The majority of my professors are great and the academics are challenging for what they are. I only wish there were more resources for students with learning disabilities."
Alum,4,"It is a larger community college. I liked taking classes here, however, there was not a sense of community."
Sophomore,4,The college is great! I love the Success centers in the Main and English building. The tutors are always willing to help and give great advice! Looking forward to another semesters at SWIC!
Sophomore,4,"Staff members focus on your needs in order to help you graduate. Academic advisors are of little help, I mostly sort out my classes and everything on my own. Materials that are needed to help you throughout school are present, there are many helpful tools."
Sophomore,4,I liked SWIC because it had the programs that I needed to excel in order to become a police officer. All the teachers have been great and have helped me succeed by understanding other time commitments or sick days.
Freshman,4,I haven't really started my college year yet. But what I have done with the college has been good and all worked out smoothly.
Sophomore,4,"Attending Southwestern Illinois College has been a nice experience. I've enjoyed all my classes and have learned a lot from them. All the teachers I've had have been really nice and fair with what they expect from their students. And the faculty are very friendly and will gladly help you when needed. Overall, Swic has been a nice place to go to start out my college experience without any debt."
Freshman,4,My experience at Southwestern Illinois College has been good so far.  Somethings I like about Swic is that the teachers really make sure you understand the material. What I would like to see at Swic is more focused students.
Alum,4,"I went here as a Running Start Student. Some of the teachers were accepting and others were very mean. Most of the teachers didn't even question or mention the fact that I was a high school student taking college classes. Some pointed it out and graded very harshly because of it. For the most part it was a very enriching experience. I loved taking classes with people from all sorts of backgrounds and experiences because it is a two year college, you get more diversity in the classroom. It makes for a very nice and unique experience"
Niche User,4,"My experience with SWIC has been really great! All of my teachers have all shown that they care about me doing more than passing my classes, but also that I actually learning the material. There's also a place to go to for tutoring in almost all types of classes; I spent a lot of time in the math tutoring department (my math teacher gave us extra credit to put towards our exams for studying in there) and all of the tutors were so nice and genuinely wanted to help me and see me succeed in my class. Overall, I'm very happy and thankful for my experience here at SWIC."
Sophomore,4,Affordable and useful experience. Great choice if you are not yet sure what career path you wish to pursue. Most classes transfer over to a four year university!
Sophomore,4,I love this college there is a lot of diversity with ethnicity and age groups. I think the wide variety of classes are great and it isn’t hard to work around a work schedule. Most professors are nice and easy going. Some not so much though this needs improvement.
Niche User,4,"As a former running start student, I found pleasure at my short time at SWIC. There are many clubs and organizations available for those apart of the student body. I enjoyed the courses I took and the professors. Many of them were very interested in the options and voices of their students which I found satisfying."
Sophomore,4,Small little college the is more job oriented education than a normal 4 year school. Just wish I the school would become a four year school instead of two year school.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time at SWIC. The small class sizes are very nice and most of the professors there are an absolute delight."
Niche User,4,"I had a good learning experience and  it is a great place to start your College career. The campus is small, but large enough to meet new people and connect with professors. Since it’s a community college there is no real “College life” but if you meet the right people it can still be enjoyable."
Sophomore,4,The teachers are pretty easy to get along with and are always helpful when you ask for it. The College has free tutoring which has improved my overall grades. It is a community college so the classes are relatively small and the teachers are very helpful and will slow down when needed.
Junior,4,The Sam wolf campus was good until they took away the food. The classes are small and some of the instructors are really helpful.
Sophomore,4,I love the small feel of the college. I wish the teachers got to know their students a little better.
Sophomore,4,"The environment and class sizes are perfect for a great learning experience. The professors at SWIC truly want to see you succeed, and help you focus on your goals. They have a huge selection of degrees options, they pair with local universities to make sure credit transfer appropriately. The campus is well maintained and enjoyable to take a short study breaks and sit outside with friends. The food is good and SWIC offers a large variety of breakfast and lunch options. There are also many other food options just a short walk off campus."
Alum,4,The campus was small but that means that the faculty actually cared about the students. All of the teachers I had there were genuinely interested in making sure that their students succeeded.
Freshman,4,"Its a great campus with a friendly community. The services here are great and convenient for students. It's an extremely cheap college as well. The only thing I have to complain about is that the teachers are hit and miss. Some teach you important thing pertaining to the class, some just give you busy work. Do your research before picking classes for the semester."
Freshman,4,"Very Diverse school, full of friendly people and passionate educators.  Swic has a lot of opened minded people to learn aside and and have new experiences with."
Alum,4,SWIC is a great junior college for getting core classes out of the way in an economically efficient fashion. They have several new buildings and additions as of the last few years as well as the original building that is kept up quite meticulously. Would recommend for any freshman that is having trouble deciding on a major and university.
Freshman,4,"I like that SWIC is a very friendly, and safe learning environment. Being able to ask my teachers for help anytime I need and they are gladly there to help me whenever it is needed. I appreciate how SWIC is a fun environment to be in and they try to get you involved in everything which is good for everyone."
College Junior,4,I have some very passionate teachers
College Junior,4,It gives you resources you need so you can succeed
Recent Alumnus,4,I love being able to make my own schedule and there is always lots of options for the classes and the times. It's actually kind of fun and frustrating at the same time to get your class schedule figured out so they all work together.
Recent Alumnus,4,I have had a lot of help getting everything ready for transferring schools and getting together the classes I needed to transfer.
Recent Alumnus,4,I really have had some amazing teachers at SWIC. I loved that I was able to interact in basically all my classes and ask questions whenever I had them and engage in conversations about the material.
Recent Alumnus,4,The school I'm going to has a terrific nursing program even though I am not attending theirs because I am choosing to do an accelerated program. The general education classes I need for me to begin nursing schools have defiantly taught me so much already and I love learning about it because it's what I want to do in life and I love learning things that I'm going to be able to and can apply to during every day life.
Recent Alumnus,4,Highschool wasn't my favorite and lets just say I love college. I love that I get to make my own schedule. I love learning now. When your going to school and learning toward your future career it makes it so much more fun and makes you want to actually learn. I enjoy school and I enjoy that I started at a community college because it was easy and not to big and I really got the help I needed to figure out everything I  needed to know about college.
College Junior,4,I often had shuffle my classes certain times I might have to be somewhere at a certain time so I had put in classes that fitted my schedule time.
College Junior,4,"The classes are easy so far but it will get harder,the professors will help you in any way they can.The quality of the coursework not too much,not too little."
College Junior,4,Right night now I'm majoring in Exercise Science at the local community college to later become a Physical Therapist I really didn't really take any classes in the program yet but the classes that I took sound interesting.
College Junior,4,"The college teachers is very helpful when you need help,the staff is very welcoming.The school is there to help you."
College Freshman,4,"The online courses are great, but the downfall is trying to teach yourself a subject that you do not know. I've taken about 6 online classes and all of my professors did a good job explaining everything."
College Freshman,4,All of my professors were fun and easy to talk to. They were also somewhat lenient compared to other professors. They are always there to help and they do a good job teaching the material for the most part.
College Sophomore,4,Low cost for High level education
College Junior,4,Culinary arts is a great program at SWIC. It provides a lot of useful information for this degree.
College Junior,4,"It is extremely helpful, they have resource centers if you're struggling with homework or tests and they'll you for free!"
College Junior,4,"The class schedules are real flexible. As of now, I've had no problems and the classes are catered to when I learn best."
College Junior,4,"It's a really laid back college, cheap, and the people there are easy to talk to. It's pretty small and the teachers are incredibly helpful. I'd choose it again, but I am leaving for more opportunities at a university."
College Junior,4,"I've had a few frustrations with my classes, but I was able to work them out with my professors or on my own."
College Junior,4,My experiences with the professors and courses offered have (thankfully) been nothing but positive! Professors are very open to answering questions and communicating with students outside of class.
College Junior,4,"The classes are challenging and require a lot of outside work, but sometimes the professors can be generally unclear and not communicate with the class well."
College Junior,4,"It is very flexible!  The supervisor of my job, which is also where I go to school, creates the work schedules to work around student worker class schedules.  Therefore, school and class interference is no issue.  I also have time to go to doctor appointments when classes are over for the day."
College Junior,4,"I am lucky to have a job at the same place I go to school.  My supervisor who schedules my work hours works around my classes, so school and work interference is no issue.  I also have time to go to doctor appointments after classes are over for the day.  It is very flexible and I have had few hassles or frustrations.  I have not transferred credits thus far, but my faith in the school has me believing that it will go over smoothly when it comes time to transfer."
College Junior,4,My courses were fun and interesting.  My teachers were kind and helpful.  There is a reasonable variety of classes offered and the class sizes always even out to a manageable amount.
College Senior,4,It is good. Have to make sure you get the right professor. Go on ratemyprofessor.com. Its easy to look up reviews on professors
College Sophomore,4,"You can only miss so many days of class before you need a doctor's note, but the teachers are really understanding about the fact that life happens, and will help you stay afloat when you return. Like most schools, if you miss weeks or more of classes then you can be dropped, but if you're missing weeks or months of school, then you should probably take some time off to sort things out."
College Sophomore,4,"As far as community colleges go, SWIC is one of the best in the area. It has three campuses to suit the needs of the kids in the areas and the Belleville Campus (where I attend) is easily reached by metro. The school's got plenty of different associates level degrees, and the counselors help to move you onto a four year college of your choice. It's cheap and a great place to get your gen eds out of the way. They've also got plenty of night classes for people who work during the day and are continuing their education."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is very helpful and the teachers are very personable.
College Freshman,2,"There are places for people looking for employment but it's nothing significant. You can also be trained for job interviews and things like that but for the most part, there isn't a big program for career finding."
College Freshman,2,Southwestern Illinois College is just a small college almost in the middle of nowhere and there aren't many notable alumni or jobs that have connections with the school. The majority of students go off on there own after they graduate.
College Freshman,2,I believe that SWIC focuses on the first two years of college and nothing more.
College Junior,2,They really only have a career type program here.
College Sophomore,2,Overall I find SWIC a little boring. Given the opportunity I feel like I would choose to go to a four year institution directly out of high school. 
College Sophomore,2,Since SWIC is a community college there is not a strong alumni network. Everyone who goes to SWIC moves on and joins 4 year institution's alumni programs. I do not have any information on job prospects because I have not graduated yet. The career center is not good either. 
College Junior,2,"In a lot of my classes i feel like people don't care about their education as much as i do, and they don't take it as serious. "
College Senior,2,never been told of any. do they have any post-grad services?
College Senior,2,its not a real university. they treat us like we are still in high school some teachers even have seating charts. we are adults we pay them to be there not the other way around. no mutual respect in teacher student relations.
College Senior,2,some of the office workers are incompetent no matter how hard you try they will always looses some paperwork. i always keep copies now so i have them when they loose them.
College Freshman,2,WI-FI was always slow due to all the people using it.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not too sure about the councelors at the Beleville campus, but at the Granite City campus, councelors don't seem like too much help."
College Senior,2,"Almost every time I go to use the school wifi on my laptop, I have issues connecting, and then the connection is usually pretty slow when it works. It costs to print here, not just for copies. I think there is an adequate number of computers available for students, if they aren't being used for things other than homework."
College Freshman,2,"SWIC Highschool – They call SWIC the 5th year of highschool because the teachers pander and ""spoon feed"" the students. However, the school is reasonably affordable to help get the Gen. Eds. out of the way."
College Freshman,2,"Great School but Bad Students – Most of the students who should receive financial aid don't and those students who don't need it do; but, what i mean is this... There are students at SWIC who show up to class to receive state aid for tuition, books, RENT FEES, TRANSPORTATION FEES, and other living expenses. They will show up to class for the first four weeks then, once they get their checks, you will never see them again. I, on the other hand, need the tuition assistance but can't receive it because of the people who run this scam. There is no limit to how many times they can re-enroll for a class either. This system just perpetuates a cycle of not going to school to further education and get a 9-5 job where you earn your own living instead of stealing from the state.
But, I enjoy my classes at SWIC and learn quite a bit. I would recommend SWIC to other students for a 2 year transfer college to get your General Education classes out of the way."
College Junior,2,A Lot Like High School – SWIC is a lot like high school and it can get annoying.
College Sophomore,2,"Career Center Unhelpful – After going to school you will have to place yourself in many different positions to get hired, because they do not secure you with an job after your two years of college"
College Sophomore,2,Unique Nursing Program – My school has an unique nursing program. I am am to learn and catch on to my daily studies fast at this campus. The teachers are great and help me learn the things i didnt know before entering this field. I feel secured at this campus as for as my studies to become and Registered Nurse.
College Sophomore,2,THERE IS NOT MUCH OF A VARIETY IN THE FORM OF WHEN CLASSES ARE OFFERED IF THE CLASS IS NOT A GENERAL EDUCATION CLASS FOR ALL FIELDS SO MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR DAILY SCHEDULE AROUND YOUR SCHOOL SCHEDULE.
College Senior,1,hard to get through the process. lost may pieces of my paperwork. it two weeks till the end of the semester and just now getting approval for financial aid because they lost my paperwork time and time again. said it was lost in the fax even though i have the confirmation sheet that said all were sent correctly.
College Freshman,1,Campus Life – Sitting in the cafeteria is about it. They try to do fun things but everyone is between 18-50 years old so its tough
College Senior,1,"I like the program, I am in. I am getting a degree in medical Assisting. I would choose this school as long as I did not have to deal with their financial aid office. The financial aid office is horrible."
